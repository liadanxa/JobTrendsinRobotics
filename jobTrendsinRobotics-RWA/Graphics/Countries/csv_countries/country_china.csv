grenoble is 600k inhabitants city right in the middle of the french  
alps. it has a very big university and at least 10% of the population  
is made of students. grenoble activity is turned toward high  
technology industry and research. its domains of excellence are  
nanotechnology, computer sciences and electronic. all mountain  
outdoors leisure are next door (the closest ski resort is 30 minutes  
from downtown).

- emotion research group
the research group (www-laplace.imag.fr) is made of 25 persons  
(permanent researchers, engineers and phd students). it is a very  
international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

offer for a post-doc position at inria (france) on navigation in dynamic and human-populated environments 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

title: 
------- 
navigation system in dynamic and human populated environments to improve the mobility of frail people. 

key words: 
--------------- 
robotics, navigation systems, perception, prediction, human aware navigation, assistance to frail people. 

summary: 
------------- 
this postdoc takes place in the scope of the inria large scale initiative action 
aen pal (personally assisted living http://pal.inria.fr/) which gathers the research activities 
of several inria research teams to improve the autonomy and the quality of life for the elderly 
and fragile persons. the action aims to create a research infrastructure that will offer 
technology solutions to improve the quality of life of frail people and their proximity circle. it 
focuses on the autonomy of the elderly in home health care by securing, preserving or 
restoring their functions necessary for everyday life. 

subject: 
---------- 
the objective of this postdoc is to develop navigation technologies adapted to the 
mobility assistance of aging or disabled people. the core of this work relies on 
complementary skills of arolag and e-motion inria projects concerning mapping, 
localization and safe navigation in dynamic and human populated environments. 
autonomous robotic systems are progressively moving from controlled laboratory 
environments towards real-world applications. state of the art approaches now endow robots 
with the ability to navigate within complex real-world environments by taking into account 
both the robot's surroundings and its position within the environment. additionally, the 
perceptual capabilities of these systems have recently been augmented through the use of realtime 
visual sensors that provide a very rich source of information [meilland10]. 
one of the major problems remains the capability to deal with large variations of the scene 
over time. 
a first objective will be to develop a novel approach to capture and characterize the 
information shared by different views of a dynamic and evolving environment registered 
under different conditions of observations. doing this, we expect to get a representation well 
adapted to autonomous navigation tasks and robust to the changes in the environment. 
relying on this representation, a second objective will be to develop navigation strategies that 
allow the robot to safely move in changing environment, with a socially acceptable behaviour. 
in the scope of the postdoc, we propose to integrate previous works developped both in 
arolag and e-motion research teams adressing the navigation decision process [fulgenz10], 
the spherical robot-centered representation of the environment described in [meilland11], 
abilities to predict the near future of this perceived environment [mvavasq 2007], and social 
conventions [irosrios 2011]. 
the core of the work will be focused on dynamic and evolving environments. by dealing with 
dynamic environment, we think of objects present in the environment moving in the scene 
(for example people) during the robot navigation. by evolving environment, we consider that 
configurations of the scene can change during time (door open or closed, chair, medical 
devices…) 
robustness, adaptability and cost of implementation of the developed technologies will be a 
major requirement. 
the approaches will be implemented on two experimental platforms: an automated 
wheelchair (inria platform at grenoble) and a smart walking aid (inria platform at 
sophia-antipolis).

module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances

the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in

54,2015,phd positions available at the italian  institute of technology to work on the icub," dear roboticists, this is to advertise the following phd positions with scholarship at the icub facility, istituto italiano di tecnologia. the positions are available through the phd course of bioengineering and robotics, curriculum on advanced and humanoid robotics. successful applicants will join the icub facility department at the istituto italiano di tecnologia in genoa (http://www.iit.it/icub). for additional details please check: http://www.iit.it/en/openings/phd-calls.html ******** theme 1: articulatory information for automatic speech recognition in human-robot verbal interaction tutors: giorgio metta, leonardo badino description:  state-of-the art automatic speech recognition (asr) systems produce remarkable results in some scenarios but still lags behind human level performance in several real usage scenarios and perform poorly whenever the type of acoustic noise, the speaker's accent and speaking style are ""unknown"" to the system, i.e., are not sufficiently covered in the data used to train the asr system. the goal of the present theme is to create a robust speaker-independent key phrases recognition system where commands delivered by a user to a robot (i.e., the key phrases) have to be recognized in unconstrained utterances (i.e., utterances with hesitations, disfluencies, additional out-of-task words, etc.), in the challenging conditions of human-robot verbal interaction where speech is typically distant (to the robot) and noisy. to improve the robustness of the recognition system to intrinsically challenging and/or unknown conditions we will create recognition systems that combine acoustic features with predicted vocal tract articulatory movements (canevari et al. 2013) thus exploiting the articulatory representation of speech where phonetic targets (i.e., the articulatory targets necessary to produce a given sound) are largely invariant and complex phenomena observed in speech are can be compactly modeled. requirements:  the successful candidate will have a degree in computer science, bioengineering, physics or related disciplines. a background in speech and language processing is a plus. reference:  [1] canevari, c., badino, l., fadiga, l., metta, g., ""cross-corpus and cross-linguistic evaluation of a speaker-dependent dnn-hmm asr system using ema data"", interspeech workshop on speech production for automatic speech recognition, lyon, france, 2013. contacts: leonardo.badino at iit.it, giorgio.metta at iit.it ******** theme 2: whole-body real-time motion planning and control in compliant humanoids: theory and implementation on the icub tutors: francesco nori, giorgio metta, daniele pucci description:  the icub is among the few humanoids capable of whole-body motion control while being compliant to perturbations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrpbssqer3a). these capabilities are possible thanks to the icub peculiar sensors such as whole-body distributed tactile and force sensing. these sensors allow the icub to simultaneously control joint movements, joint torques and interaction forces. within this context, motion control is still an open research activity since previous approaches mainly dealt with kinematic movement planning. the icub instead needs a dynamic planner to simultaneously plan movements, torques and interaction forces. the goal of the proposed theme is to develop a kinematic and dynamic motion control software. given a control task, the foreseen controller will compute not only the kinematics (i.e. joint trajectories) but also the dynamics (i.e. joint torques and interaction forces) to perform the task. among the various solutions to the problem, optimal control will represent a primary focus of attention. specific tasks will include multi-contact motion planning [2], whole-body motion planning [3] and non-rigid contact motion planning. the project will be conducted within the context of a european project and the candidate will be asked to spend a six months experience in a foreigner country as a visiting ph.d. student. requirements:  candidate is requested to have a background in control theory, computer science and/or robotics. specific background in optimal control will be positively evaluated. special requirements: this theme is supported by an itn-h2020 research grant (secure). candidates should satisfy the eligibility criteria of the marie sk?odowska-curie actions. the position is suitable for candidates who have not have resided or carried out their main activity in italy for more than 12 months in the last 3 years preceding their recruitment. note: the position is associated with a considerably higher salary than a regular studentship and offers many opportunities to travel to the other european partners in the network. reference: [1] f nori, s traversaro, e jorhabib, f romano and d del prete a.;

55,2015,phd openings in advanced robotic 	manipulators," phd openings in advanced robotic manipulators advanced industrial automation lab (aial) department of advanced robotics (advr) istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit) the iit is an english language research institute founded on 2003 on the  model of international technological centres, placed in genoa. its aim  is to promote excellence in both basic and applied research and to  facilitate the economic development at national level. the institute has  a staff of about 1400 people with about 85% of personnel dedicated to  research. 44% of the researchers come from abroad, 28% are scientists  from more than 50 countries and 16% are italian researchers who have  come back to italy after a professional experience abroad. the average  age of the iit staff is less than 34 years, with a gender distribution  of 41% women and 59% men. iit has produced about 5000 publications and  more than 150 inventions resulting in 300 patent applications. its  research activity led to the creation of 10 start-ups, with additional  13 start-ups currently being  launched(http://www.iit.it/images/stories/scientific_plan/iit-8-year-eng-final.pdf). the aial-advanced industrial automation lab  (http://www.iit.it/it/advr-labs/advanced-industrial-automation.html) has  a number of fully funded phd openings (starting in november 2015). young  scientists with excellent first/master degrees (in computer science,  mechanical/electrical engineering or other related fields) and strong  competencies and interest in one or more of the followings areas  (physical system modelling/rigid body dynamics, reconfigurable  mechanism, robot control, mechanism design, mechanical/mechatronic  engineer or robotics, matlab and c/c++ programming) are invited to apply  for admission. the successful candidates will be involved in basic/applied research  projects based on the virtual prototyping design method  (http://www.iit.it/it/virtual-prototyping-design.html) that permits to  build very detailed numerical models of the robots and then to improve  strongly their performances and design. they will closely interact with  all the other advanced robotics labs and groups as well as the r&d of  large enterprises (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-projects.html) and abroad  research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations  (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1)development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel  robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on  automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of  manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low  volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to  quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive  to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots,  sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is  very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software  framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal  of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software  based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive,  easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means  the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost  every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile  also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the  developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the  experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from  the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since  it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the  virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body  and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit  these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable  for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong  interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science.  the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies

low speed performances.  the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the  flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is  still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is  affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the  settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the  potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power  for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the  elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these  results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders  as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic  link, to go further

both basic and applied research and to facilitate the economic development at national level. the institute has a staff of about 1400 people with about 85% of personnel dedicated to research. 44% of the researchers come from abroad, 28% are scientists from more than 50 countries and 16% are italian researchers who have come back to italy after a professional experience abroad. the average age of the iit staff is less than 34 years, with a gender distribution of 41% women and 59% men. iit has produced about 5000 publications and more than 150 inventions resulting in 300 patent applications. its research activity led to the creation of 10 start-ups, with additional 13 start-ups currently being launched (http://www.iit.it/images/stories/scientific_plan/iit-8-year-eng-final.pdf). the aial-advanced industrial automation lab (http://www.iit.it/it/advr-labs/advanced-industrial-automation.html) has a number of fully funded phd openings (starting in november 2015). young scientists with excellent first/master degrees (in computer science, mechanical/electrical engineering or other related fields) and strong competencies and interest in one or more of the followings areas (physical system modelling/rigid body dynamics, reconfigurable mechanism, robot control, mechanism design, mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics, matlab and c/c++ programming) are invited to apply for admission. the successful candidates will be involved in basic/applied research projects based on the virtual prototyping design method (http://www.iit.it/it/virtual-prototyping-design.html) that permits to build very detailed numerical models of the robots and then to improve strongly their performances and design. they will closely interact with all the other advanced robotics labs and groups as well as the r&d of large enterprises (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-projects.html) and abroad research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer science, 20% mechanism reference: fei chen, ferdinando cannella, carlo canali, traveler hauptman, giuseppe sofia, darwin g. caldwell, ''in-hand precise twisting and positioning by a novel dexterous

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in mechanics. the background must be in mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics. the ideal competencies should be in multibody simulation/finite element analysis and robot dynamics and control. required technical skills: 70% mechanics, 30% control reference: fei chen,

subject to csc policy -fulfil the relevant entry requirements of the university of bath, including a high level of english language proficiency, and be issued with an unconditional offer letter from the university -meet the selection criteria set out by csc -satisfy applicable visa requirements. project: robotic active perception is a key factor to develop autonomous systems capable of safely and intelligently interact with humans and their surrounding environment. active perception allows robots to not only make accurate decisions, but also to autonomously perform actions that will lead the robot to improve its own performance during a specific task, such as autonomous driving, wearable assistive robots and human-robot collaboration. even though state-of-the-art robots are equipped with multimodal sensors (e.g., vision, touch, hearing, force, gyroscopes), perception in robotics has been investigated using one sensing modality at a time. this fact, limits robots' potential for autonomous learning, control, decision-making and actions, which also reduce the capability of robots to behave safely and intelligently. this project, which is in the intersection of robotics and machine learning, is focused on the design and development of novel and robust computational methods for active perception using multimodal data from vision, touch, force and inertial measurement sensors simultaneously. the methods developed during this project will be implemented and tested in the rosbot mobile robot, and with the racing car developed by the team bath racing electric (tbre). other potential applications for the methods developed in this project are in human-robot interaction and collaboration, manufacturing, autonomous flying, telecontrol and telepresence, assistive robots and wearable robots for physical assistance. the research to be undertaken in this project has a strong multidisciplinary nature. the student is expected to collaborate with project partners from areas of electronic and electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, psychology and industrial partners. furthermore, the student is expected to attend multiple events such as conferences, project meetings, summer schools and workshops. candidate: applicants should hold an undergraduate masters first class degree or msc distinction (or non-uk equivalent) in robotics,
