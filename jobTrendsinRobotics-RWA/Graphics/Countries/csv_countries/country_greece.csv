2,2008,"postdoc position mbari, california","[apologies for multiple messages]


the autonomous system group at the monterey bay aquarium research  
institute (mbari) invites applications for 1 postdoc position.

mbari (http://www.mbari.org)  is a private non-profit oceanographic  
research institute located in moss landing, california, in the heart  
of the  largest marine sanctuary in the united states, just outside  
silicon valley. the institute is an inter-disciplinary research  
institution guided by a strong peer relationship between scientists,  
engineers and marine operations staff. mbari pioneered the use of  
remotely operated vehicles (rovs http://www.mbari.org/dmo/vessels_vehicles/tiburon/tiburon.html) 
  and autonomous underwater vehicles (auvs http://www.mbari.org/auv/default.htm) 
  for deep ocean research and continues to be at the cutting edge of  
marine robotics, marine sensor development, ocean chemistry, marine  
geology, micro-biology and ecology.

research focus:

the autonomous systems group is uniquely placed as being the only  
artificial intelligence group within an operational oceanographic  
setting anywhere. the focus of the groups effort is in automated  
reasoning for embodied robust intelligence for auvs with a focus on  
automated planning, execution, constraint-based reasoning and machine  
learning. the core development effort is to enable adaptive control  
for auvs to survey, sample and characterize dynamic and episodic ocean  
phenomenon such as harmful algal blooms, fronts and thin layers which  
have substantial societal impact (http://www.mbari.org/autonomy/ 
trex/). further efforts are underway to study the feasibility of goal- 
based commanding for underwater feature-based slam, mixed-initiative  
platform control and multi-vehicle coordination.

research environment:

the autonomous systems group was established in 2005 by researchers  
from nasa with extensive background in commanding spacecraft including  
the twin mars rovers spirit and opportunity. a strong inter- 
disciplinary effort with biological oceanographers at mbari and others  
outside has driven the design and deployment of a hybrid executive*  
which enables an auv to adaptively sample the environment using  
planning and machine learning techniques to inform dynamic in-situ  
behavior. publishing in peer-reviewed conferences and journals in ai,  
robotics and the ocean sciences and interacting with scientists in the  
fields of biology, chemistry, ecology, genetics, ocean physics, marine  
robotics is an important aspect of the research effort. the group  
collaborates with ai and robotics researchers in academia in the us  
and europe and hosts visiting graduate students and researchers from  
within the us and europe.

key topic areas of interest for this position are:

1. automated planning and execution
2. scheduling
3. machine learning
4. constraint-based reasoning
5. distributed planning

applicants are encouraged to communicate with the pi for project

the usa, and japan as well as companies such as abb,  honda research, franka emika, and porsche motorsport.? the irosa and  the? ias lab are located in the city center campus of tu-darmstadt close  to the beautiful herrngarten park. *about tu darmstadt* tu darmstadt is one of germany?s top technical universities and is well  known for its research and teaching. it was one of the first  universities in the world to introduce electrical engineering programs,  and it is germany?s first fully autonomous university. more information  can be found  onhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technische_universit%c3%a4t_darmstadt *about darmstadt* darmstadt is a well-known high-tech center with essential activities in  spacecraft operations (e.g., through the european space operations  centre, the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological  satellites), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology,  telecommunications, and mechatronics, and consistently ranked among the  top high-tech regions in germany. darmstadt?s important centers for  arts, music, and theatre allow for versatile cultural activities, while  the proximity of the odenwald forest and the rhine valley allows for  many outdoor sports. the 33,547 students of darmstadt?s three  universities constitute a significant part of darmstadt?s 140,000  inhabitants. darmstadt is located close to the center of europe. with  just 17 minutes driving distance to the frankfurt airport (closer than  frankfurt itself), it is one of europe?s best-connected cities. most  major european cities can be reached within less than 2.5h from darmstadt."
