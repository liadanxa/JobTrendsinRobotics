"
15,2014,senior electronics engineer at yujin robot's innovation team,"yujin robot’s innovation team is looking for an experienced and
passionate senior electronics engineer with product development
experience in robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, the
automotive industry or a similar technology field. you will provide
input to the overall design of yujin robot’s future prototypes and
products, be responsible for the technical design and specification of
the robot’s electronic system and develop individual electronic
components.

the recently formed innovation team is a small, highly motivated and
multinational group with a focus on turning the promise of the future
into yujin robot’s products of tomorrow. since robots are complex
electronic systems, in which various sensors, actuators, computers,
network devices and power supplies need to work together, the engineer
we seek does not need to be an expert in each related field, but needs
to understand enough to build a reliable system. hence, we are looking
for a generalist, rather than a specialist. since we aim to turn our
prototypes into products, experience in product development is
crucial. you will be the bridge to our electronics suppliers and
development partners and also work closely with yujin robot’s other
electronic engineers to solve day-to-day challenges. driving the
electronics development for our prototypes and products will require
you to be comfortable with defining the technical design and
specification for the overall electronic system as well as individual
components. the latter also includes logic and circuit design.
electronic component development will also require you being
experienced with outsourcing design work.

you will be free to do things your own way, however this will require
you to be highly self-organised while still being able to ride with
the team. we offer flexible working hours, good payment and enough
off-time to recharge in a highly creative and dynamic workplace..


key roles & responsibilities
- design and technical specification of the robot’s electronics system
- logic and circuit design of electronic components
- management of outsourcing jobs
- collaboration with yujin robot’s electronics team, external
suppliers and development partners


requirements
- minimum 5 years experience in product development
- minimum bachelor’s degree or equivalent
- expert/mother tongue korean and professional english
- experience in outsourcing design work
- experience with orcad or similar tools
- highly self-organised and natural team worker
- energetic and passionate


desirables
- experience in power supply design
- c/c++ firmware programming
- experience in the robotics field


if you feel ready to join our team, write to jobs at yujinrobot.com, tell
us why you are right for the job (cover letter, max. 1 page) and don’t
forget to attach your cv (max. 2 pages). all application material
needs to be submitted as a pdf. we are looking forward to hearing from
you!
