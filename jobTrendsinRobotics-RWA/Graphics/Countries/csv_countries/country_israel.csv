(http://www.bgu.ac.il <http://www.bgu.ac.il/> ) is seeking a graduate
student. 

 

execution of purposeful arm movements such as pointing, reaching and
grasping involves high computational complexities. this is because more
degrees of freedom (dof) are available in the arm than are actually needed
for reaching a target in space. the current research involves the
development of a novel robotic controller based on paradigms which belong to
the modern science of complexity such as cellular automata, self-organizing
and self-synchronization networks and discrete chaotic dynamics (dcd). we
have developed some results for mathematical modeling of brain neuronal
networks by dcd algorithms which have been demonstrated principle ability
for multi-component system control and navigation. these results could be
used for the developing of controller for robotic arm and hand motion
control.

 

candidates with engineering, computer science or mathematics background are
sought. candidates must have solid knowledge in mathematics and computer
programming. knowledge in control, an robotics is advantageous.

application deadline: september 21, 2012 (12 noon, italian time)

application requirements:

strongly-motivated candidates holding a master degree in computer science / engineering / mathematics or other related fields are invited to apply. applicants should ideally have a background in machine learning, robotics or human-robot interaction, with strong mathematical and computer programming skills (matlab, c++ or equivalent).

application procedure:

to apply please send a detailed cv, statement of motivation, bsc and msc transcripts, degree certificates and other support material such as reference letters to dr sylvain calinon (sylvain.calinon at iit.it). the applicants also need to fill the online application procedure from the university of genova: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten .


the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

ability to increase the sense of safety and security, (2) the relation between interaction quality, level of autonomy and sense of safety and security, and (3) new quantitative measures that can support qualitative evaluation tools. during a secondment  to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, evaluation procedures will be compared and combined. during an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, alternative approaches to evaluation of social robots will be investigated and compared, possibly leading to modified procedures. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2554&rmlang=uk about ?rebro university and aass ----------------------------------------------- ?rebro university is seeking outstanding candidates for two phd positions in computer science at the center of applied autonomous  sensor systems. the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass), carries out multi-disciplinary research environment at ?rebro university in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer science. successful applicants will join the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.oru.se_aass&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=b66frycb1clpvv8uaass4d8a5cuxijz2xy1n8fnefow&e= ) at ?rebro university,  sweden . salaries for phd students at ?rebro university are internationally competitive. with over 40 senior researchers and phd students, aass is one of the largest robotics research groups in  sweden . the research and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic, and phd students come from many different countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds. about socrates ------------------------- the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn) comprising  7 universities/research institutes: ume?

53,2020,full-time international phd position at  university college dublin  ireland  ," phd  ireland  : develop a framework using machine learning (ml) to identify specific features of stress response using plant phenotyping background:early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant for food security but methodologically complex. plant stress responses can be observed using non-invasive methods such as plant imaging. the use of different camera sensors such as rgb, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence enable the detection of altered plant performance in response to environmental stress. such changes include slower growth, senescent changes in the spectral reflectance and modified fluorescence responses of leaves. although these changes cannot be captured by human eye, the imaging sensors used in this project can perceive such changes very fast. to understand the early responses of plants to environmental stress, we will develop a framework of data collection, storage and curation, trait extraction and utilization of ml and classification algorithms to extract the features from plant images. plant images will be collected using imaging platforms in a controlled environment and unmanned aerial vehicles in field conditions(uavs). project:this exciting project will develop a specific framework that utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization and visualisation to identify specific features of stress response using thousands of plant images. the ph.d. student will have the opportunity to participate

a critical role in defining offspring health, both in childhood and in later life. according to the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) hypothesis, transient environmental exposures during critical periods of development (such as the pre-conceptional, fetal and early infant phases of life) can alter the health trajectory of the offspring. maternal diet is a modifiable behaviour that could play an important role in maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. novel findings from our individual birth cohort studies and the alphabet consortium highlight the potential influence of maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential during pregnancy on birth outcomes and a range of offspring childhood health outcomes. however limited data regarding the interrelationships between maternal diet and lifestyle, placental development and birth and childhood outcomes in humans exist. project: this exciting project will address this gap in the knowledge base by harnessing information on maternal diet &amp; lifestyle and pregnancy/birth/offspring outcomes using existing databases and analysis of biological samples from several birth cohort studies. the phd student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by dr catherine phillips, assistant professor and lead principal investigator for this research programme at the school of public health, physiotherapy and sports science, university college dublin. details: this is a 4-year full-time position, open to eu and non-eu candidates, with a stipend of 18,000 per annum.  qualifications: candidates should hold a bachelor's degree in nutrition, biological sciences (physiology, developmental biology, reproduction), public health or related field and have an interest in early life/fetal programming, nutrition and metabolic health. experience in pregnancy and childhood research, epigenetics or nutritional assessment techniques would be desirable.  application process: informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to dr. catherine phillips (catherine.phillips at ucd.ie). applications including a detailed cv, letter of motivation (max 2 pages, single spaced), transcripts and two letters of recommendation (to be sent directly from referee) should be sent to catherine.phillips at ucd.ieno later than march 23rd 2020. 	phd opportunity: dietary sugars / sweeteners during pregnancy and their impact on long term maternal metabolic and reproductive health background: there is significant evidence that an unhealthy diet greatly increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and predisposes offspring to metabolic dysfunction and obesity. while fat intake is typically associated with the onset of obesity and its comorbidities, there is increasing evidence linking sugar, particularly high fructose corn syrup, to the global rise in obesity rates. furthermore the detrimental effects of fructose intake during pregnancy on mother and child have been clearly outlined. despite their wide availability there is only limited information regarding their impact on maternal pregnancy outcomes, placental/fetal development and long term risk of cardio-metabolic complications in the mother. previous work from the group has demonstrated that the artificial sweetener ace-k increases insulin resistance during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. this project will investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners in combination with a high fat diet during pregnancy on maternal obesity, metabolic and reproductive health during successive pregnancies. this project will provide training in key laboratory skills ranging from rodent physiology, biochemical, cellular and molecular techniques. training in experimental design, data analysis and scientific writing will also be provided. this project would be ideal for a student with a background in a biological science (nutrition, physiology, reproduction, biochemistry) with a keen interested in nutrition and metabolic health. funding information:this is a 4-year full-time position with a stipend of e18,000 per annum. how to apply: the application must be submitted via email to clare.reynolds at ucd.ie not later than tuesday, 10th march 2020 and must include to find out more: enquiries can be directed via email to the

new collaborative science foundation ireland (sfi) strategic partnership research programme, entitled consus, focussed on the application of precision agriculture to crop production with a particular emphasis on optimisation of agri-food production systems leading to more efficient food production with lower environmental impacts. the outcomes from this research programme will deliver a step-change in crop agronomy tools and practices, leading to enhanced global competitiveness. applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a 4-year phd studentship with the consus team researching crop nutrition and limits to yield potential. globally, major gains in crop yield and quality have been made through the application of the major plant nutrients (macronutrients) such as n, p and k in fertilizer. however, with the supply of adequate levels of these macronutrients, concentrations of micronutrients, such as zn, cu and mn, in soil and plant can drop below optimum and become yield- and quality-limiting. this is particularly the case in more intensive cropping systems with higher yields and removal of micronutrients in exported plant materials. fertilizer n is a major variable input cost to most conventional farming systems. in addition, poor use efficiency can increase the risk of loss to the wider environment, and associated impacts on water quality, air quality, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. this phd will use laboratory and field experimental approaches to develop an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat. this position will be in the ucd school of agriculture and food science

commonly associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs. in humans, most hev infections cause an acute, self-limiting hepatitis. however, severe disease can occur, particularly in pregnant women or those with pre-existing liver disease. hev infection is also associated with other disease manifestations including neurological disease, however the reason why severe disease occurs is poorly understood. currently, there are no specific treatments for hev, and there is no licenced vaccine in europe. hev is extremely challenging to propagate in cell culture, and there is no robust method to screen food products for the presence of infectious virus. this project will aim to develop in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hev, and to use these systems to investigate the biology of this virus in pigs and humans. the student will work with an interdisciplinary team at ucd, based at the veterinary sciences centre, and will have the opportunity to develop their research skills in one health and zoonotic disease. the student will collaborate with research groups at ucd, the university of birmingham and pirbright institute in the uk, and the cleveland clinic, ohio, usa, over the course of the phd programme. this is a truly interdisciplinary project, working on an important and poorly understood viral infection. we are searching for an enthusiastic individual, with a first or upper second-class degree in a relevant subject, to work on this exciting and novel project. ideally, the candidate should have laboratory experience, and previous experience in molecular biology and cell culture techniques would be an advantage. funding notes: applications and enquiries should be directed to dr. nicola fletcher at the veterinary sciences centre, university college dublin, ireland (nicola.fletcher at ucdconnect.ie). please submit a cv and letter of motivation with applications. the stipend for this position will be 18,500 + full eu or

post doc position, please write to prof. rafael sacks, atcvsacks at technion.ac.il the design and use of technology has serious implications for society as a whole. there is increasing public concern about issues such as anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of military and surveillance technologies, and the possible impacts of automation and artificial intelligence. however, decisions about technological systems are often made without transparency or democratic oversight. engineers bear much of the responsibility for the development, construction, and maintenance of technological systems, but in whose interests do they act? engineering institutions claim to be committed to public welfare, but can engineers really balance that commitment with meeting the demands of employers and clients? there is in fact evidence to suggest that the culture of engineering education and professional practice discourages engineers from placing sufficient importance on public welfare. further research is needed in this area; this phd will address that need by exploring the relationship between engineering, professional responsibility, and public welfare. both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be used to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of engineering students and professionals in ireland, as well as the contexts in which these engineers study and work. applications for this phd scholarship are invited from candidates from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography,

the advantages of the technology is its ability to tailor the design, to meet specific patient needs. given the individualized part printing however, a key consideration is to ensure the quality of the printed device. this phd project will involve the printing of both polymeric and fibre reinforced polymer composites, for use in prosthetic devices. the printing will be carried out using both a laboratory and a pilot scale fused filament fabrication system. the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the printed parts will be extensively investigated and correlated with the processing conditions. a number of advanced process diagnostic techniques (including optical imagining), will be used to monitor the printing process. working closely with colleagues in computer science, the data collected will be analysed, in order to provide process feedback. the objective is to determine if the in-process measurements can be correlated with print defects (i.e. porosity), and where possible can help to predict the formation of defects before they occur. funding: scholarship support for this phd is through the science foundationi-form advanced manufacturing research
