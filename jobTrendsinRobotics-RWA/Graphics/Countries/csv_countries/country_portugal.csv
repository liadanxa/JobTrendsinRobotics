research position (application deadline - december 6, 2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

the intelligent robotics research group of the university of aveiro,
   portugal   , is seeking a researcher to carry out work within project
""langg - language grounding for human-robot communication"".


work description
------------------
this project is aimed at contributing to the development of
user-friendly robotic servants, that is, robots that are capable of
performing useful work for humans, in normal human environments,
and that can be commanded and instructed by human users through
natural means of interaction. the specific goal of the project is to
develop symbol and theory grounding capabilities that enable robots
to interact with their human users at the language level. this is
related to a new research topic, known as computational semiotics.
to attain this goal, the project is developing an integrated set of
perception, action, interaction and learning capabilities to enable 
a real robot to gradually learn the meaning of the natural language 
words used by humans to refer to physical patterns. these patterns 
can be physical objects in the robot's environment (e.g. persons, 
furniture, etc.) or  sensory-motor patterns, corresponding to 
actions of the robot (e.g. turn left, follow wall, grasp, etc.).

learning, in this scenario, must be seen as a lifelong incremental
process through which the robot builds and maintains a semantic
network about its task domain. the planned work will focus
on grounding the names of concrete physical objects for interaction
with a robotic arm. a component-based approach to object 
representation and learning will be investigated.


duration
---------
this research position is for an initial period of six months, but can be
renewed up to one year.

phd studies
------------
there is the possibility that this work continues as a phd project after
the first six or twelve months. such decision depends on an evaluation of
the competencies and habilitations of the selected researcher.

prerequisites
-------------
candidates should have a master degree or a portuguese
""licenciatura"" degree in computer science, electronics engineering
or related fields. preferably, candidates should have previous
experience on advanced knowledge representation, and/or signal
processing and/or machine learning techniques.

for continuing as a phd student, the researcher should have a
licenciatura degree with a final grade of at least 16/20 or a master
degree.

application
------------
anyone interested should send, until *** 6 december 2006 ***,
his/her curriculum vitae plus a motivation letter to prof. luis
seabra lopes (lsl at det.ua.pt).

other information

project details
===========
project number: fp7 strep project number 248497
project title: trident: marine robots and dexterous manipulation for  
enabling autonomous underwater multipurpose intervention missions.

abstract
======= 
trident proposes a new methodology for multipurpose underwater  
intervention tasks with diverse potential applications like underwater  
archaeology, oceanography and offshore industries, going beyond  
present-day methods typically based on manned and / or purpose – built  
systems.
a team of two cooperative heterogeneous robots with complementary  
skills,  an autonomous surface craft (asc) and an intervention  
autonomous underwater vehicle (i-auv) endowed with a dexterous  
manipulator, will be used to perform underwater manipulation tasks.  
the proposed methodology is based on two steps.
during the first step, the i-auv is deployed from the asc to perform a  
cooperative path following survey, where it gathers optical/acoustic  
data from the seafloor whilst the asc provides geo-referenced  
navigation data as well as communication with the end user. during  
this phase of the mission the i-auv will be doing accurate path  
following and terrain tracking, to maximize bottom coverage and data  
quality. the motion of the asc will be coordinated with that of the i- 
auv to achieve precise usbl (ultra short base line) positioning and  
reliable acoustic communications. after the survey, the i-auv docks  
with the asc and sends the data back to a ground station where a map  
is set up and a target object is identified by the end user.  at the  
second step, the asc navigates towards a waypoint near the  
intervention area where the i-auv is launched to search for the  
object. when the object (i.e. the target of the intervention) has been  
found, the i-auv switches to free floating navigation mode. the  
manipulation of the object takes place through a dexterous hand  
attached to a redundant robot arm and assisted with proper perception.  
particular emphasis will be put on the research of the vehicles  
intelligent control architecture to provide the embedded knowledge  
representation framework and the high-level reasoning agents required  
to enable a high degree of autonomy and on-board decision making of  
the platform. the new methodology will allow the user to specify an  
intervention task, among a set of predefined ones, to be undertaken  
with regards to a particular target object selected by the end user by  
means of the map previously built. hence the intervention task is seen  
as a semi-automatic process where the target is manually selected but  
then it is automatically recognized and manipulated by the robot in a  
complete autonomous way.
the trident project brings together research skills specific to marine  
environments in navigation and mapping for underwater robotics, multi- 
sensory perception and a range of control techniques relating to  
intelligent control architectures, vehicle-manipulator systems and  
dexterous manipulation.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for auv  
navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to merge  
conventional dvl-fog navigation techniques with the recent results in  
sonar based scan matching in the context of the simultaneous  
localization and mapping techniques in order to setup a consistent and  
accurate elevation map of the seafloor. because sonar can see far  
away, it will be of interest to study how to deal with range scans  
gathered a different altitudes having then a different scale factor.  
hierarchical map structures able to accommodate these measurements  
will be studied.

vacancy 2: autonomous surface craft (asc) – autonomous underwater  
vehicle (auv) cooperative navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to use  
cooperative navigation techniques to accurately localize one or more  
auvs with the help of a dgps-equipped autonomous surface craft (or  
drifting buoy) being all the vehicles connected by means of low cost,  
low bandwidth acoustic modems. first the scenario of using an usbl in  
a direct configuration (transceiver mounted on the ship) will be  
explored and a solution explicitly taking into account the time delays  
due to the signal transmission will be proposed. then the sensorial  
requirements will be relaxed exploring the possibility of localizing  
the auv with the only help of range measurements (received for free  
with the acoustic data packets) arriving asynchronously from known  
positions (the surface craft pose). a dvl-mru equipped auv will be  
first considered, removing then the requirement of using a dvl.

vacancy 3: intelligent control architecture.
=================================
this vacancy is related with work package 3, which is responsible for  
providing the embedded knowledge representation framework and the high- 
level reasoning agents required to enable autonomy and on-board  
decision making of the platform. autonomous capabilities for  
intervention missions require heterogeneous embedded agents working in  
a dynamic operational field with hard and unpredictable environmental  
conditions. embedded agents specialise in different disciplines  
providing different capabilities or services to the overall system,  
i.e. navigation, mapping, vision, etc. this position will be related  
with the design and implementation of a path-planning agent. the main  
goal is to develop new algorithms for adaptive waypoint-based  
trajectory planning including path following, terrain following and  
obstacle avoidance. as a secondary goal, the work will also contribute  
in the design of an adaptive goal-based mission planning agent.

requirements:
===========
academic: excellent academic grades. knowledge in robotics, video/ 
sonar image processing. previous experience in navigation, mapping,  
slam techniques and/or control architectures will be appreciated. a  
master degree in the related areas will be valuable but not imperative.

         center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for two phd student positions in computer
science at örebro university,  sweden .  the positions are in the area of
hybrid knowledge representaiton and reasoning, planning and execution
monitoring in the context of the eu project race.  the positions are
for three years.  application deadline is october 15, 2011.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the students will be to perform world-class research
on hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning, and hybrid planning
and plan execution monitoring, for robotic systems.  hybrid in this
context means that the robot is capable of inferring new information
about its environment from a variety of information of different
nature.  for instance, the robot will consider flexible temporal
requirements (e.g., serving food while it is warm, but not too soon
after the previous course) together with causal requirements (e.g.,
serving a meal satisfies the goal of feeding the guests) and resource
constraints (e.g., dishes from the previous course must be cleared as
space must be made for the new course).  such requirements should be
upheld both during planning and on-line execution monitoring.

the successful candidates will be employed as phd students with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  they will work
within the local race team at örebro university, but they will also
collaborate with the other european partners in race, both remotely and
through physical meetings and research visits.  a limited amount of
teaching may also be part of the phd student's duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the race project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

race, ""robustness by autonomous competence enhancement"", is a european
union fp7 project.  the overall aim of race is to develop an artificial
cognitive system, embodied by a service robot, able to build a
high-level understanding of the world it inhabits by storing and
exploiting appropriate memories of its experiences.  experiences will
be recorded internally at multiple levels: high-level descriptions in
terms of goals, tasks and behaviours, and sensory and actuator skills
at the lowest level.  race will develop methods for conceptualizing
acquired experiences so as to extend the robot's planning and execution
capabilities beyond preconceived situations.

aass's role in race concerns (1) the development of knowledge
representation and reasoning schemes suited for reasoning about
multiple types of experiences; and (2) the use of this acquired and
inferred knowledge for plan generation and execution.  constraint-based
techniques will be explored for both representation and reasoning and
planning/execution monitoring purposes, and in particular a meta-csp
approach for integrating temporal, resource, causal and spatial
reasoning will be examined.

the race consortium consists of six european partners: the university
of hamburg (germany), the university of leeds (uk), örebro university
( sweden ), the university of osnabrück (germany), the university of
aveiro (  portugal  ), and the technology transfer institution hitec
e.v. (germany).

description
-----------

the project focuses on field robotics: the use of sturdy robots in unstructured environments. one important example of such a scenario is in search and rescue (sar) operations to seek out victims of catastrophic events in urban environments. while advances in this domain have the potential to save human lives, many challenging problems still hinder the deployment of sar robots in real situations. this project tackles one such crucial issue: effective real time mapping. to address this problem, it adopts a multidisciplinary approach by drawing on both robotics and human computer interaction (hci) techniques and methodologies. 

the project will revolve around the development of simple and effective techniques for control of raposa, a tracked robotic sar platform, as it explores unmapped, unstructured environments. raposa features stereo cameras and primary displays for the robot will be based on integrating these feeds into a head mounted display (hmd). maps will be generated on the fly via development of simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) algorithms and this content will be integrated into the hmd displays using 2d and 3d overlays and augmented reality techniques. to ensure a seamless experience, tracking technologies will be used to monitor and respond to head movements; different mappings for this process will be explored. interaction with content displayed on the hmd using multi-modal techniques such as gestures and voice, and for tasks such as annotation and disambiguation, will also be explored. requirements capture and system evaluation will be conducted in collaboration with fire fighting organizations in lisbon,   portugal  .

(project webpage: http://aurero.isr.ist.utl.pt )

a. job description: this position is based in lisbon. it involves developing and implement an interactive vision-based slam-6d algorithm, first in simulation, and then on the raposa platform. this algorithm will fuse sensory data not only from a stereo camera pair, but also from inertial data and odometry. a depth camera will also be used for an accurate 3d reconstruction of the environment. other tasks will include software integration of interaction elements (e.g. visualizations or control schemes) with the raposa platform, and participation in system evaluations. requirements include a master degree, a strong background on robotics, and preferably experience with probabilistic methods in robotics.

b. main research field: electrical and computing engineering / robotics

c. admission requirements: a masters degree in electrical and computing engineering, computer science, or a closely related field.

d. workplan: research and development of a interactive 6d-slam algorithm, fusing sensory information from several sources (vision, inertial, odometry, and depth camera). integration of the software architecture in the raposa platform. participation in the field experiments at a civil protection team training site.

the race project
-----------------------------------------------------------
the overall aim of this eu fp7 project is to develop an
artificial cognitive system able to build a high-level
understanding of the world it inhabits by storing and
exploiting appropriate memories of its experiences. robot
competence is obtained by abstracting and generalising
from experiences, extending task planning and execution
beyond preconceived situations. the project aims to
produce the following key results: (i) robots capable
of storing experiences in their memory in terms of
multi-level representations connecting actuator and
sensory experiences with meaningful high-level structures,
(ii) methods for learning and generalising from 
experiences
obtained from behaviour in realistically scaled
real-world environments, (iii) robots demonstrating
superior robustness and effectiveness in new situations
and unknown environments using experience-based planning
and behaviour adaptation. the project developments will be
integrated and demonstrated on a pr2 robot, from
willow garage.

the university of aveiro is involved in the development
of modules concerned with semantic interpretation,
recording of experiences of plan-based activities,
high-level learning about robot activities, and
human-robot interaction.

46,2012,program for the iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012),"iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012): closing the
action-perception loop
sunday october 7th 2012
vilamoura, algarve,  portugal 
url: http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/cas2012/

we gladly invite you to attend the cas2012 workshop...

it is becoming increasingly clear that future robotic systems will need to
exhibit sophisticated assistive capabilities, highly tuned and responsive
to the needs of human users. whether on autonomous platforms or within
personal computing systems, awareness of human intentions and requirements
will be an essential attribute of any robotic system aiming to be genuinely
useful. in essence, they will need to be capable of empathising with human
behaviour if they are to be truly assistive in the fullest sense of the
word.

realising such cognitive assistive systems (cas) will require advances
along the complete processing pipeline, from sensing through to learning
and interaction. for instance, sensing will need to be proactive,
anticipating user actions and environment changes to optimise data capture;
whilst learning will need to exploit knowledge gained from observation of
past actions and behaviours to predict likely human responses and reactions
under different scenarios. during task-performance, assistive systems need
to predict the perceptual changes that result as a consequence of human
actions. these are challenging tasks which are likely to require step
changes in current state of the art capability if they are to be addressed.

the aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from relevant
disciplines to exchange ideas and results on these and related tasks, as
well as on the form of existing and future cognitive assistive systems.
this will include those working in sensing, such as speech and vision,
machine learning and ai, human computer interaction, biomechanics, and on
systems and applications, including autonomous platforms, sensor networks
and wearable computing, for example. one area in which ca systems are
likely to have significant impact is in industrial manufacturing and
training, and applications in this area will be of particular interest for
this workshop.

49,2012,phd position in artificial intelligence and robotics," one phd position on planning human-aware robot behavior *****

         center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a three year phd student position in
computer science at örebro university,  sweden .  the research area is
artificial intelligence and robotics, with special emphasis on
planning human-aware robot behavior.  the work will be performed in
the context of the eu project monarch.  application deadline: january
15, 2013.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the student will be to perform world-class research
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
specifically on the topic of planning human-aware robot behavior.  the
student will create, implement and test new techniques to allow a
robot, or team of robots, to generate plans to perform given tasks
that involve the interaction with humans.  what is new compared to
traditional planning is that these plans must ensure that the robot's
behavior complies with a set of social norms and social roles, which
may depend on the interaction context.

the research will be motivated by, guided by, and validated in a
specific application scenario: robots that interact with children in a
hospital, in order to entertain them or to participate in educational
activities.  depending on the context, robots may play different roles
and they may engage in different social relations with the children,
following different social norms.  for instance, robots may be
watchful guardians in some situations, or companion players in others.
the human-aware planning techniques developed in this research project
will take the social context, norms and roles into account, and
regulate the robots' behavior accordingly.

the successful candidate will be employed as phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  he or she will
work within the local monarch team at örebro university, but will also
collaborate with the other european partners in the monarch project,
both remotely and through physical meetings and research visits.  a
limited amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's
duties.

about the monarch project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

monarch (multi-robot cognitive systems operating in hospitals) is a
european union fp7 project.  the overall aims of monarch are (i) the
development of a novel framework to model mixed human-robot societies,
and (ii) its demonstration using a network of heterogeneous robots and
sensors, in the pediatric area of an oncological hospital.  it will
handle uncertainties introduced by people and robots, generate natural
interactions, and engage in edutainment activities.  the framework
developed in monarch will map concepts in social sciences into social
skills, group behaviors, and human-robot interaction, using learning
methodologies and decision-theoretic principles.

the expected outcomes of monarch are (i) an operational system able to
interact with people in a natural way, (ii) novel results on key
properties of networked robot systems, and (iii) guidelines to
translate the system to applications in hospital environments, and
further scenarios sharing similarities with them, e.g., kindergarten,
and personal assistance to elderly at home.

the monarch consortium is formed by nine top-level european
institutions and companies: the instituto superior técnico ( portugal ),
örebro university ( sweden ), universidad carlos iii ( spain ), instituto
português de oncologia de lisboa ( portugal ), ydreams robotics
( portugal ), selftech ( portugal ), idmind ( portugal ), école
polytechnique fédérale de lausanne (switzerland), and university of
amsterdam (the netherlands).

61,2014,"final call for a phd position at the max planck institute for biological cybernetics, tuebingen, germany","apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement.

*[important note]* please be advised that the deadline to apply for this
phd position is today *31st march 2014*.

*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,
multi-robot systems.

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.


*expected qualifications and skills of the candidate*

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical
   engineering, computer science or other related fields.
   - the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
   spoken language.
   - prior experience in computer vision and image processing is essential.
   - the candidate must have excellent programming skills in one or more
   languages, e.g., c, c++ and python.
   - knowledge and experience in robot operating system (ros) will be a
   plus.

*selection procedure*
interested candidates who meet the above mentioned requirements should send
the following documents (all in pdf format) to aahmad at isr.ist.utl.pt by
31st march, 2014

   - motivation letter.
   - curriculum vitae (including a list of publications)
   - online link to their own code snippets or softwares developed (these
   can be inserted as a section in the cv).
   - a 2-page summary of their master thesis or any other research results
   (which they consider as their most important results) (bibliography should
   not be within these 2-page limit)
   - copy of the last diploma and transcripts (grade sheet).

selected candidate will be expected to enroll in the phd program in the
beginning of september 2014 at the university of tübingen and will carry
out their research work at max planck institute for biological cybernetics,
tübingen. however, prior to the phd enrollment, the candidate will be
expected to undertake an additional research internship at the institute
for systems and robotics in instituto superior técnico, lisbon. the
internship is foreseen for a period of 3-4 months starting around may 2014.

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

*summary of the chopin project (http://chopin.isr.uc.pt):
multi-robot systems (mrs) are a sub-class of multi-agent systems
which have great potential as regards parallelism, efficiency and
robustness in tasks which are either distributed in space or too
complex to be accomplished by a single mobile robot. these benefits
hinge on suitable internal team organization to achieve coordination
 and cooperation, which in turn requires efficient sharing of
information. mrs may be very useful on assisting humans in many
distributed activities, especially in hazardous scenarios, by extending
human perception and actuation with distributed sensors and
actuators. the chopin project aims at exploiting this human-robot
symbiosis in the development of human rescuers’ support systems
for small-scale search and rescue missions in urban catastrophic
incidents, an application domain with an unquestionable beneficial
impact on society. a proof of concept will be developed for innovative
techniques about cooperation between teams of human agents and
teams of mobile robotic agents and collaborative context awareness.

electronic engineering and computer sciences - robotics and automation

*prerequisites/profile:
a m.sc. degree (5 years of university studies) in electrical/electronic
engineering or computer science. preference is given to candidates
with a m.sc. thesis experience in autonomous mobile robotic systems,
and experience on robots programming in robot operating system (ros).

*work plan:
the candidate will ensue research work within the chopin project 
(cooperation between human and robotic teams in catastrophic
incidents, http://chopin.isr.uc.pt) on cooperative/collaborative work
between mobile robot teams and teams of humans. the scientific goals
are: i) developing innovative methods for collaborative context awareness
and efficient information sharing between first responders and robotic
teams in urban search and rescue (sar) scenarios; ii) proposing
decentralized cooperative architectures for collaborative work between
human and teams; iii) carrying out experimental work with mobile robots
interacting with human teams to validate such methods in realistic sar
scenarios.

*location:
the research work will be carried out at the university of coimbra
(http://www.uc.pt/en) in the artificial perception for intelligent systems
and robotics (ap4isr) team (http://ap.isr.uc.pt) of the institute of systems
and robotics (http://www.isr.uc.pt). the candidate will be under the

*summary of the chopin project (http://chopin.isr.uc.pt):
multi-robot systems (mrs) are a sub-class of multi-agent systems
which have great potential as regards parallelism, efficiency and
robustness in tasks which are either distributed in space or too
complex to be accomplished by a single mobile robot. these benefits
hinge on suitable internal team organization to achieve coordination
 and cooperation, which in turn requires efficient sharing of
information. mrs may be very useful on assisting humans in many
distributed activities, especially in hazardous scenarios, by extending
human perception and actuation with distributed sensors and
actuators. the chopin project aims at exploiting this human-robot
symbiosis in the development of human rescuers’ support systems
for small-scale search and rescue missions in urban catastrophic
incidents, an application domain with an unquestionable beneficial
impact on society. a proof of concept will be developed for innovative
techniques about cooperation between teams of human agents and
teams of mobile robotic agents and collaborative context awareness.

*[important note]* please be advised that the deadline to apply for this
phd position is *31st march 2014*.

*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,
multi-robot systems.

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.


*expected qualifications and skills of the candidate*

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical
   engineering, computer science or other related fields.

   spoken language.
   - prior experience in computer vision and image processing is essential.
   - the candidate must have excellent programming skills in one or more
   languages, e.g., c, c++ and python.
   - knowledge and experience in robot operating system (ros) will be a
   plus.

*selection procedure*
interested candidates who meet the above mentioned requirements should send
the following documents (all in pdf format) to aahmad at isr.ist.utl.pt by

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

intelligence for smart and soft robots* the sense of touch is fundamental in humans to explore and learn about the own-body and the external world, and to be able to develop self-awareness and successfully interact with the environment. similarly, robots can use tactile sensing to learn about their bodies and how to interact with humans and objects. despite the recent advancements of tactile sensing technologies, their deployment in practical application is still quite limited, although the landscape of possible applications is huge: minimal invasive surgery, rehabilitation, telepresence, automation and robotics. by optimizing the design of soft sensors based on a technology we recently proposed (seehttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8000399/) this project will look at realizing deployable soft sensors for smart (and maybe soft) robots that can work both in industry and in public spaces, as well as intelligent control algorithms for these robot to learn from the tactile interactions. *3) ten hec phd scholarships in *electronic engineering and computer science (including *robotics*) the queen mary university of london, in partnership with the higher education

intelligence for smart and soft robots* the sense of touch is fundamental in humans to explore and learn about the own-body and the external world, and to be able to develop self-awareness and successfully interact with the environment. similarly, robots can use tactile sensing to learn about their bodies and how to interact with humans and objects. despite the recent advancements of tactile sensing technologies, their deployment in practical application is still quite limited, although the landscape of possible applications is huge: minimal invasive surgery, rehabilitation, telepresence, automation and robotics. by optimizing the design of soft sensors based on a technology we recently proposed (seehttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8000399/) this project will look at realizing deployable soft sensors for smart (and maybe soft) robots that can work both in industry and in public spaces, as well as intelligent control algorithms for these robot to learn from the tactile interactions. *4) several **fully-funded **phd scholarships in the intersection of media/* *design/art **and technology (including robotics)* are available at qmul's phd training centre on

but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 187.353 (january 1, 2016), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 187.353 (january 1, 2016), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

(4) name and contact of two referees. *about the research goals of the fellowship: * one of the goals of the orient project (?goal-directed eye-head coordination in dynamic multisensory environments?) is the use of a biomimetic robotic oculomotor system (head/eye/vestibular/auditive) to study oculomotor control on humans and robots.  humans are extremely fast and efficient in relocating their gaze direction to different points in the visual field through saccadic eye movements. however, current robots are still unable to achieve similar performances. this project aims to bring robots closer to the human performance by exploiting modern control theory, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms, all applied to a novel tendon-driven biomechanical system, which was designed according to the kinematics of the human eye. simultaneously, we will uncover the neural mechanisms that biological systems may use to control complex motor systems with redundant degrees of freedom. the work consists of the development of *oculomotor kinematics and dynamics control systems, following biomimetic principles on a realistic mechanical model of the human visual-motor system*, as well as the co-supervision of phd and msc students working on the project. the work will be supervised by prof. alexandre bernardino at isr/ist in close collaboration with prof. john van opstal. *about the host institution isr/ist: * ist is the largest and most reputed school of engineering, science and technology in  portugal , with long tradition in teaching, and excellence in research, innovation and training activities. since its creation in 1911, ist?s mission is to contribute for the  development of the science, economy and society by promoting a higher degree of education in the areas of science, engineering and technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels and by delivering highly qualified professionals in the public and private sector, strengthening the national and european r&d effort. the isr-lisboa (institute for systems and robotics) is the research institute of ist involved in multidisciplinary research activities in the areas of mobile autonomous robotics (land, underwater and space autonomous vehicles), computer and robot vision, automation and control, dynamic systems, signal and image processing, communications, biomedical engineering, evolutionary systems, artificial intelligence, manufacturing systems and aeronautics. isr-lisboa is home to nearly 150 researchers (including approximately 50 faculty members and postdoctoral researchers). the isr-lisboa team involved in this project has has a solid expertise in the areas of vision based control, active vision, computer vision and vision-based navigation, and hosts several humanoid robotic platforms (including an icub). it has been involved in major eu projects like caviar, mirror, contact, robotcub, first-mm, handle, robosom, poeticon++ and urus. *about lisbon: * lisbon, with a population of about one million inhabitants (2 million in the metropolitan area), is the capital, the chief port and the largest city of  portugal . it stands on the westernmost point of land of the european continent, where the tagus river flows into the atlantic ocean. its climate is probably the mildest of all european capitals. lisbon is one of the most ancient cities in the western europe. probably inhabited since the neolithic period, it was settled by phoenicians in 1200 bc, who named it alis ubbo (calm port). they prospered for more than 600 years until it was occupied by greeks and carthaginians, then by the romans in 205 bc, by the barbarians in the 5th century ac, by the arabs in 715 ac, till it was finally conquered by d. afonso henriques during the crusades in 1147, and declared capital of the portuguese kingdom in 1252. the city name evolved with each new occupant until its present form lisboa. in the 15th and 16th centuries, the age of the discoveries, lisbon became the center of the world and the entrance of europe to the oceans. being already an important city when conquered in 1147, it continued growing its importance. in 1260 the king afonso iii transferred his court there from coimbra. the university of lisbon was founded in 1292. it is perhaps this long history of finding new lands and cultures that explain why lisboans are, by nature and tradition, open to the new and very welcoming to visitors. --  alexandre bernardino associate professor, instituto superior t?cnico senior researcher, institute for systems and robotics ist - torre norte, 7? - av. rovisco pais, 1049-001 lisboa.  portugal  tel. +351-218418293, fax. +351-218418291, web: www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~alex"

(4) name and contact of two referees. *about the research goals of the fellowship: * one of the goals of the orient project (?goal-directed eye-head coordination in dynamic multisensory environments?) is the use of a biomimetic robotic oculomotor system (head/eye/vestibular/auditive) to study oculomotor control on humans and robots.  humans are extremely fast and efficient in relocating their gaze direction to different points in the visual field through saccadic eye movements. however, current robots are still unable to achieve similar performances. this project aims to bring robots closer to the human performance by exploiting modern control theory, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms, all applied to a novel tendon-driven biomechanical system, which was designed according to the kinematics of the human eye. simultaneously, we will uncover the neural mechanisms that biological systems may use to control complex motor systems with redundant degrees of freedom. the work consists of the development of *oculomotor kinematics and dynamics control systems, following biomimetic principles on a realistic mechanical model of the human visual-motor system*, as well as the co-supervision of phd and msc students working on the project. the work will be supervised by prof. alexandre bernardino at isr/ist in close collaboration with prof. john van opstal. *about the host institution isr/ist: * ist is the largest and most reputed school of engineering, science and technology in  portugal , with long tradition in teaching, and excellence in research, innovation and training activities. since its creation in 1911, ist?s mission is to contribute for the  development of the science, economy and society by promoting a higher degree of education in the areas of science, engineering and technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels and by delivering highly qualified professionals in the public and private sector, strengthening the national and european r&d effort. the isr-lisboa (institute for systems and robotics) is the research institute of ist involved in multidisciplinary research activities in the areas of mobile autonomous robotics (land, underwater and space autonomous vehicles), computer and robot vision, automation and control, dynamic systems, signal and image processing, communications, biomedical engineering, evolutionary systems, artificial intelligence, manufacturing systems and aeronautics. isr-lisboa is home to nearly 150 researchers (including approximately 50 faculty members and postdoctoral researchers). the isr-lisboa team involved in this project has has a solid expertise in the areas of vision based control, active vision, computer vision and vision-based navigation, and hosts several humanoid robotic platforms (including an icub). it has been involved in major eu projects like caviar, mirror, contact, robotcub, first-mm, handle, robosom, poeticon++ and urus. *about lisbon: * lisbon, with a population of about one million inhabitants (2 million in the metropolitan area), is the capital, the chief port and the largest city of  portugal . it stands on the westernmost point of land of the european continent, where the tagus river flows into the atlantic ocean. its climate is probably the mildest of all european capitals. lisbon is one of the most ancient cities in the western europe. probably inhabited since the neolithic period, it was settled by phoenicians in 1200 bc, who named it alis ubbo (calm port). they prospered for more than 600 years until it was occupied by greeks and carthaginians, then by the romans in 205 bc, by the barbarians in the 5th century ac, by the arabs in 715 ac, till it was finally conquered by d. afonso henriques during the crusades in 1147, and declared capital of the portuguese kingdom in 1252. the city name evolved with each new occupant until its present form lisboa. in the 15th and 16th centuries, the age of the discoveries, lisbon became the center of the world and the entrance of europe to the oceans. being already an important city when conquered in 1147, it continued growing its importance. in 1260 the king afonso iii transferred his court there from coimbra. the university of lisbon was founded in 1292. it is perhaps this long history of finding new lands and cultures that explain why lisboans are, by nature and tradition, open to the new and very welcoming to visitors. --  alexandre bernardino associate professor, instituto superior t?cnico senior researcher, institute for systems and robotics ist - torre norte, 7? - av. rovisco pais, 1049-001 lisboa.  portugal  tel. +351-218418293, fax. +351-218418291, web: www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~alex"
