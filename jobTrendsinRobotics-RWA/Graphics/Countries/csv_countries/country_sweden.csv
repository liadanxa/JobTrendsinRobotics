this project is entitled ""rossi; emergence of communication in robots 
through sensorimotor and social interaction"", and focuses on the 
development of communication between robots and humans 
(http://www.rossiproject.eu).
in particular, the project is addressing the question of how critical it 
is for communicating agents to share the same general view of the world. 
  agents possessing different sensory and motor systems may have 
different views of the world and therefore may have difficulties in 
communicating. we are exploring to what extent and which aspects of 
world models must be shared in order to facilitate communication between 
robots and humans.  we wish to increase understanding of the 
requirements of affordance based world models, shared models and 
communication provided by such models, based on understanding of 
objects, actions, and processes in their environment. the focus of this 
project is the construction of robots that are able to process simple 
commands and to respond appropriately by interacting with different 
kinds of objects and entities in their environment. this project has 6 
partners in italy, germany,  sweden  and turkey, involving psychologists, 
neuroscientists, computer scientists and robotics engineers. we are 
involved in all stages but especially the implementation of the models 
in a robotic manipulation system and the testing and experimentation 
with real application tasks.

we wish to appoint a post-doctoral research associate who will take 
major responsibility for the programme of research in the context of our 
robotics team.  this post is available on a three-year fixed-term 
contract. we expect to appoint for a start date of 1 march 2008.

- applicants should have a doctorate in computer science, artificial 
intelligence, engineering, or a related scientific field, and be able to 
demonstrate research experience.
- the post requires excellent software skills for the implementation and 
running of a range of experimental components.
- the successful applicant will also be involved in writing scientific 
documents and papers and will be expected to travel and give 
presentations as necessary.

            ***** phd student position available *****

       center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     orebro university,  sweden 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.


about orebro university:

orebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university currently enrolling
more than 15,000 students.  it is located in orebro, a city of 130,000
inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the aass mobile robotics lab is one of the three research groups within
the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass).  aass carries
out multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science,
and measurement technology.  the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come from a dozen different
countries, in europe and worldwide, and have different scientific and
cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently hosts international
researchers and is involved in several international projects.  this
means, particularly in the gert project, that the enrolled phd student
will have the opportunity to travel and to cooperate with people in
other countries.

the aass mobile robotics lab is internationally renowned for its
research in cognitive robots, robot ecologies and artificial olfaction.
further information can be found at www.aass.oru.se/research/robots/.

the student will work under the joint supervision of alessandro saffiotti
and lars karlsson.  the student will receive a monthly salary adequate to
the cost of living in  sweden , and will be included in the swedish social
security system.


prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a clear interest in the research topic, to a strong
theoretical background in computer science, and to solid programming
skills, the applicant should have a masters or equivalent degree in an
appropriate field (including computer science, computer engineering, or
robotics).  knowledge of the swedish language is not required, but
proficiency in written/spoken english is mandatory.  candidates with
previous experience in artificial intelligence or in robotics will be
preferred.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to

            ***** phd student position available *****

       center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     orebro university,  sweden 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.

20,2010,phd position available on grasping of novel objects,"phd position available on robust robot grasping of novel objects
funded by the european commission, fp7 programme, grant no 248273

a phd position is available on the gert project (generalising robot
manipulation tasks) in the intelligent robotics lab at the university
of birmingham in the uk. the position includes a stipend at standard
uk rates (£13,290 per annum initially). applicants should be citizens
of the european union.

the specific goal of the phd will be to apply techniques from
stochastic process control to the automatic discovery of finger
closing strategies for a multi-fingered robot hand when grasping novel
objects of known surface shape. the result will be finger closing
strategies that are robust to variations in the relative position of
the robot hand and object, object orientation, and other environmental
properties. in particular the approach will use finger closing
strategies for known objects as seeds in the search for robust
controllers.

the successful applicant will have an outstanding degree in computer
science, mathematics, physics, or electronic engineering. you should
be in the top 5% of your graduating class, with exceptional
communication, coding and mathematical skills.

the project is part of an fp7 funded strep project, held jointly with
the german aerospace research institute (munich), orebro university
( sweden ) and the max planck institute for biological cybernetics
(tuebingen).

the overall project goals are as follows:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots will need to be much  more flexible and robust in the
face of novelty. in this project we will develop new methods to cope
with novelty in manipulation tasks. our approach is to enable the
robot to autonomously generalize its manipulation skills to new
objects. the basic idea is that some successful implementations of a
certain robot manipulation task, such as serving a drink, are given as
input. the aim is that these programs then constitute a database of
prototypes representing that class of task. when confronted with a
novel instance of the same task the robot needs to generalize from the
prototypes, establishing appropriate correspondences between objects
and actions in the prototypes and their counterparts in the novel
scenario. in this way, prototypical task plans may be mapped to a new
plan that is suitable for handling different geometric, kinematic, and
dynamic task settings, hence solving a task that is physically
substantially different but similar at an abstract level. this kind of
knowledge transfer or generalization shall not be restricted just to
the most abstract layer. rather, low-level primitives as well as high-
level logical robot actions and operators will be adapted.

in the first instance send your cv and academic transcript to dr
jeremy l wyatt, and dr rustam stolkin, (jlw at cs.bham.ac.uk and
stolkinr at cs.bham.ac.uk). closing date for this is 1 june 2010.

                   orebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a position as a post-doctoral researcher
in the area of hybrid planning at orebro university,  sweden .  this is
an initial 18 month appointment fully funded within the eu project
gert -- ""generalizing robot manipulation tasks"".  interested
candidates can apply now and until the position is filled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the gert project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and
robust in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project
we address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such
novelty in manipulation tasks.  

the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a robot to autonomously
generalize its manipulation skills from a set of known objects to
previously unmanipulated objects.  to do so, the gert project includes
research activities in the areas of hybrid planning (see below),
perception, learning and grasping.  the platform used within gert is the
dlr robot justin, a very advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.

the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute (germany), the
university of birmingham (uk), and orebro university ( sweden ).  more
details on can be found on the project web site www.gert-project.eu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the position
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the successful candidate will be employed as a postdoc with orebro
university for an expected duration of 18 months.  the main task of
the postdoc will be to perform world-class research on hybrid planning
in the context of the gert project.  hybrid planning in this context
means that, when planning for a task, the robot needs to reason both
about the purposes of actions on a symbolic level, and about the
kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects it manipulates.  
the research is expected to involve a suitable combination of
theoretical investigation, concrete implementation, and empirical
validation on the justin platform at dlr.

the postdoc will work within the local gert team at orebro university,
which currently includes two faculties, a postdoc and a phd student.
she or he will also collaborate with the other european partners in
the gert project, both remotely and through physical meetings and
research visits.  a small amount of teaching may also be part of the
postdoc's duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
prerequisites and application process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

in addition to a clear interest in the research topic, the successful
applicant must have a strong theoretical background in computer science,
and solid programming skills.  a phd in computer science, computer
engineering or comparable field is required.  we particularly seek
candidates with experience in artificial intelligence and planning, and
with inclinations towards cross-disciplinary research.  knowledge of the
swedish language is not required, but proficiency in written/spoken
english is mandatory.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <asaffio at aass.oru.se>.  applications can be
sent immediately, and they will be accepted until the position is

about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the students will be to perform world-class research
on hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning, and hybrid planning
and plan execution monitoring, for robotic systems.  hybrid in this
context means that the robot is capable of inferring new information
about its environment from a variety of information of different
nature.  for instance, the robot will consider flexible temporal
requirements (e.g., serving food while it is warm, but not too soon
after the previous course) together with causal requirements (e.g.,
serving a meal satisfies the goal of feeding the guests) and resource
constraints (e.g., dishes from the previous course must be cleared as
space must be made for the new course).  such requirements should be
upheld both during planning and on-line execution monitoring.

the successful candidates will be employed as phd students with örebro

race, ""robustness by autonomous competence enhancement"", is a european
union fp7 project.  the overall aim of race is to develop an artificial
cognitive system, embodied by a service robot, able to build a
high-level understanding of the world it inhabits by storing and
exploiting appropriate memories of its experiences.  experiences will
be recorded internally at multiple levels: high-level descriptions in
terms of goals, tasks and behaviours, and sensory and actuator skills
at the lowest level.  race will develop methods for conceptualizing
acquired experiences so as to extend the robot's planning and execution
capabilities beyond preconceived situations.

aass's role in race concerns (1) the development of knowledge
representation and reasoning schemes suited for reasoning about
multiple types of experiences; and (2) the use of this acquired and
inferred knowledge for plan generation and execution.  constraint-based
techniques will be explored for both representation and reasoning and
planning/execution monitoring purposes, and in particular a meta-csp
approach for integrating temporal, resource, causal and spatial
reasoning will be examined.

                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a phd student position in computer science
at örebro university,  sweden .  the position focuses on the study of
stigmergic algorithms for robotic devices.  the main area is artificial
intelligence, but the topic also relates to theoretical computer science
and to robotics.  research work will involve a combination of theory
development and empirical experiments.  apply by january 28, 2012.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
in detail
----------------------------------------------------------------------

about the research project:

sigmergy is one of the many fascinating phenomena which can be observed
in nature.  stigmergy is defined in wikipedia as: ""a mechanism of
indirect coordination between agents or actions, [in which] the trace
left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a
next action, by the same or a different agent"".  stigmergy has important
connections with robotics and computer science.  by stigmergy, many
simple robotic devices could, via indirect communication through the
environment, exhibit a collective behavior which is significantly more
complex than the individual behavior of each robot.

this phd project will study stigmergic algorithms for robotic devices.
the methodology will involve a combination of theoretical and practical
investigation.  the theoretical investigation will be aimed at defining
a robotic stigmergic system, as a function of the type of robots and of
the type of stigmergic medium in which they operate; and at studying the
formal properties of such a system, e.g., which global algorithms can be
implemented in a distributed way through stigmergy, and what are the
properties of these implementations (e.g., completeness, soundness,
convergence, optimality and computational complexity).  the practical
investigation will be aimed at verifying the hypotheses generated by the
theory through experiments performed in real, physical systems.  it will
employ a floor containing a regular grid of read/write rfid tags.

the successful candidate will be employed as a phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  the student is
expeted to collaborate with other international research groups
interested in the study of stigmergy in artificial systems.  a small
amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's duties.

in other countries.


about the research project:

the position is funded mainly by the allo project: ""autonomous
long-term load-haul-dump operations"". this project is a joint effort
together with volvo construction equipment and ncc construction, and
will contribute to aass' strong position in 3d perception and
field-robotics research. the overall goal of the project is to enable
industrial wheel loaders working autonomously for several days, at a
real-world work site --- which means that the system must be able to
handle the dynamic nature of a site that is being changed by other
actors.

in particular, the following list outlines some important research
topics that will be handled in the project.
 * dynamic 3d map maintenance
 * map quality assurance
 * dynamic planning and scheduling
 * quantitative evaluation of pile handling

in our present collaborative project (the all-4-eham project) we have
developed the essential building blocks of such a system: scanning 3d
perception under vehicle motion, object detection, navigation and path
planning, and detection and shape analysis of gravel piles for efficient
handling.

the primary focus of the allo project will be the problems that an
autonomous system faces during long-term operation. other parts of the
project deal with improving the performance of the tasks from all-4-eham
and developing quantifiable and certifiable quality-evaluation criteria.
the focus on long-term operation puts further weight on the need to
develop consistent algorithms that produce correct results.


prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a strong interest in the topic, a solid theoretical
background and excellent programming skills (the current code base is
mainly written in c++), applicants should also have the equivalent of
a master's degree in a relevant field (e.g., physics, applied
mathematics, robotics, computer science, etc). we particularly seek
candidates with good knowledge of mathematical statistics and
numerical optimisation. experience in robotics (for example, ros or

sunday october 7th 2012
vilamoura, algarve,  portugal 
url: http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/cas2012/

we gladly invite you to attend the cas2012 workshop...

it is becoming increasingly clear that future robotic systems will need to
exhibit sophisticated assistive capabilities, highly tuned and responsive
to the needs of human users. whether on autonomous platforms or within
personal computing systems, awareness of human intentions and requirements
will be an essential attribute of any robotic system aiming to be genuinely
useful. in essence, they will need to be capable of empathising with human
behaviour if they are to be truly assistive in the fullest sense of the
word.

realising such cognitive assistive systems (cas) will require advances
along the complete processing pipeline, from sensing through to learning
and interaction. for instance, sensing will need to be proactive,
anticipating user actions and environment changes to optimise data capture;
whilst learning will need to exploit knowledge gained from observation of
past actions and behaviours to predict likely human responses and reactions
under different scenarios. during task-performance, assistive systems need
to predict the perceptual changes that result as a consequence of human
actions. these are challenging tasks which are likely to require step
changes in current state of the art capability if they are to be addressed.

the aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from relevant
disciplines to exchange ideas and results on these and related tasks, as
well as on the form of existing and future cognitive assistive systems.
this will include those working in sensing, such as speech and vision,
machine learning and ai, human computer interaction, biomechanics, and on
systems and applications, including autonomous platforms, sensor networks
and wearable computing, for example. one area in which ca systems are
likely to have significant impact is in industrial manufacturing and
training, and applications in this area will be of particular interest for
this workshop.

45,2012,phd position in artificial intelligence and robotics," one phd position on planning human-aware robot behavior *****

         center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a three year phd student position in
computer science at örebro university,  sweden .  the research area is
artificial intelligence and robotics, with special emphasis on
planning human-aware robot behavior.  the work will be performed in
the context of the eu project monarch.  application deadline: january
15, 2013.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the student will be to perform world-class research
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
specifically on the topic of planning human-aware robot behavior.  the
student will create, implement and test new techniques to allow a
robot, or team of robots, to generate plans to perform given tasks
that involve the interaction with humans.  what is new compared to
traditional planning is that these plans must ensure that the robot's
behavior complies with a set of social norms and social roles, which
may depend on the interaction context.

the research will be motivated by, guided by, and validated in a
specific application scenario: robots that interact with children in a
hospital, in order to entertain them or to participate in educational
activities.  depending on the context, robots may play different roles
and they may engage in different social relations with the children,
following different social norms.  for instance, robots may be
watchful guardians in some situations, or companion players in others.
the human-aware planning techniques developed in this research project
will take the social context, norms and roles into account, and
regulate the robots' behavior accordingly.

the successful candidate will be employed as phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  he or she will
work within the local monarch team at örebro university, but will also
collaborate with the other european partners in the monarch project,
both remotely and through physical meetings and research visits.  a
limited amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's
duties.

about the monarch project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

monarch (multi-robot cognitive systems operating in hospitals) is a
european union fp7 project.  the overall aims of monarch are (i) the
development of a novel framework to model mixed human-robot societies,
and (ii) its demonstration using a network of heterogeneous robots and
sensors, in the pediatric area of an oncological hospital.  it will
handle uncertainties introduced by people and robots, generate natural
interactions, and engage in edutainment activities.  the framework
developed in monarch will map concepts in social sciences into social
skills, group behaviors, and human-robot interaction, using learning
methodologies and decision-theoretic principles.

the expected outcomes of monarch are (i) an operational system able to
interact with people in a natural way, (ii) novel results on key
properties of networked robot systems, and (iii) guidelines to
translate the system to applications in hospital environments, and
further scenarios sharing similarities with them, e.g., kindergarten,
and personal assistance to elderly at home.

the monarch consortium is formed by nine top-level european
institutions and companies: the instituto superior técnico ( portugal ),
örebro university ( sweden ), universidad carlos iii ( spain ), instituto
português de oncologia de lisboa ( portugal ), ydreams robotics
( portugal ), selftech ( portugal ), idmind ( portugal ), école
polytechnique fédérale de lausanne (switzerland), and university of
amsterdam (the netherlands).

we are looking for a student who will investigate novel methods in
robotic grasping and manipulation. current approaches to robotic
manipulation are largely representing such actions in a discrete and
heuristic way. while currently even rigid object manipulation remains
challenging due to the presence of incomplete and noisy data, we are
particularly interested in developing novel continuous representations
which are invariant under certain classes of deformations, thus enabling
a robot to reason about deformable objects and/or classes of objects.

we are a leading lab pursuing this nascent area which is highly
interdisciplinary and which can benefit from ideas from probability
theory, riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. the candidate will
join the group of prof. danica kragic ( www.csc.kth.se/~danik/) and will
be co-supervised by dr. florian pokorny ( www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/).

this is a four-year time-limited position that can be extended up to a
year with the inclusion of a maximum of 20% departmental duties, usually
teaching.  doctoral students must be registered at kth. the starting
date is open for discussion, though ideally we would like the successful
candidate to start as soon as possible.

employment
----------

form of employment: time-limited
work time: full time
the salary follows the directions provided by kth
start date: according to agreement

54,2013,ph.d. position in ethics of robotics (with a focus on robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders),"the department of philosophy of the university of twente in the netherlands
is looking for a ph.d. student in ethics of robotics, with a focus on
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

your profile

a master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy (preferably but not
exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues
relating to  human-robot interaction.  highly motivated to become part of
an international team of researchers and to contribute to the success of
the dream project. good analytical skills. good organizational skills. good
communication skills in english, in writing as well as orally. creativity,
open-mindedness and ability to develop new ideas.

our offer

we offer you a four-year full-time ph.d. position, starting in 2014 (the
exact starting date will be communicated during the interview) and at the
end you should have completed your phd thesis the gross salary is € 2.083,-
per month in the first year going up to €2.664,- in the fourth year.
additionally, the university of twente provides excellent facilities for
professional and personal development, a holiday allowance (amounts to 8%),
an end-of-year bonus (amounts to 8,3%) an a number of additional benefits.
the position also comes with a travel budget.

information and application

for information you can contact the research  leader of the “ethics” work
package, dr. m.j.k coeckelbergh (e-mail: m.j.k.coeckelbergh at utwente.nl)
your application should contain the following documents: a letter of

64,2014,"four postdoc positions available at the  center for applied autonomous sensor systems,  sweden "," ======================================================================              ***** four postdoc positions available *****           center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)                       ?rebro university,  sweden  ====================================================================== ---------------------------------------------------------------------- in short ---------------------------------------------------------------------- applications are invited for four postdoc positions at ?rebro university,  sweden .  all positions are funded by the national project ""semantic robots"". we seek applicants in one or more of the following areas: -- long term 3d mapping and localization -- vision based mapping and localization -- semantic perception and semantic object perception ---------------------------------------------------------------------- about the semantic robots project ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the overall aim of the project is to develop semantic robots, that is, robots which use multi-semantic models of their environment, tailored to their action and perception capabilities, in order to automatically derive and execute action plans that achieve given goals. the project will integrate research in robotics and artificial intelligence to address closely related topics, namely, semantics-based perception, 3d world modelling and planning for long-term operation in dynamic environments. semantic perception provides human-like meaning to the information a robot acquires about its environment: it derives symbolic representations from sensor data and uses them for reasoning.  models of the robot's environment should go beyond current 3d metric and topological maps, as they should be able to store and maintain more than just geometric information over long periods of time. the information extracted from the models could then be used for planning at different levels of abstraction, from task planning to fleet motion coordination. the semantic robots project involves ?rebro university as the academic partner and a number of swedish industrial partners, including volvo construction equipment, atlascopco and kollmorgen automation. the overall aim is twofold: to advance the state of the art in key areas of robotics and artificial intelligence, and to demonstrate the results obtained in industrially relevant settings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- about the positions ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the successful candidate will be employed as a postdoc with ?rebro university for an expected duration of 2 years. the main task of the postdocs will be to perform world-class research on one or more of the areas below. background/expertise in combinations of these areas is a plus. -- long term 3d mapping and localization in large scale dynamic environments the research in this area will focus on building consistent 3d maps of large environments. this involves working with cutting edge 3d scanning technology applied to autonomous industrial vehicles operating in real-world settings. more specifically, the work will address the development of new algorithms to deal with varying scales of dynamics in the environment, so as to maintain accurate models over long periods of time. in addition, research in this area will also focus on extracting and maintaining relevant semantic information (e.g., terrain classification, lane extraction, traffic flow information) from the model of the environment. the work will be carried out in close cooperation with several industrial partners, over different application scenarios.  additional opportunities for work on computer vision based methods and camera based modelling and localization are also within the scope of this area. the successful candidate will have prior experience in mapping, slam and 3d scan registration. experience with vision-based mapping and localization is a plus. -- vision based mapping and localization in natural environments the work in this area will focus on using and developing novel camera techniques for mapping and localization in large, real-world environments, ranging from large gardens to indoor warehouses. research in this area will concentrate on using machine learning and data mining techniques for developing new ways of representing additional semantic information into maps. for instance, part of the effort will be to include into maps information about different types of vegetation in outdoor environments and loading/storage areas or pedestrian crossings within warehouses. also, the work will encompass camera based modeling, detection and tracking of people. although the main focus of this area lies with using camera-based sensors, it will be possible to work also with other sensor modalities, such as lidar, laser or rgbd. the work in this area will be carried out in close cooperation with several industrial partners.  the successful candidate will have prior experience in the areas of machine learning, computer vision and mapping. -- semantic perception semantic perception is a central component to enable higher level reasoning and planning in robotic systems. an important part of semantic perception involves naming objects and measured phenomena in the environment and understanding the relations between them. this also entails providing an intuitive description of the environment in term of semantics that can be effectively shared with human users. the successful candidate will have experience in semantic perception for robotics involving both multi-modal perception, and applications in indoor and outdoor environments. the candidate is expected to hold a phd degree in the domain of machine learning, computer vision, or robotics. excellent skills in software development are required. experience with working with industry is a plus. successful candidates will work in close cooperation with a core group of senior researchers and phd students at aass who specialize in knowledge representation and reasoning, perception and mapping and planning for robots.  the results obtained within the scope of semantic robots are expected to be demonstrated outside lab test conditions in industrially-relevant scenarios and to be published in top-ranking conferences and journals. a small amount of teaching may also be part of the postdoc's duties. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- prerequisites and application process ---------------------------------------------------------------------- in addition to a clear interest, the successful applicant must have a solid theoretical background and working experience in one or more of the above research topics. a phd degree in computer science, robotics or comparable field is required, as well as a strong publication record in relevant topics. knowledge of the swedish language is not required, but proficiency in both written and spoken english is mandatory. to apply for a position, please send to <sr-recruitment at aass.oru.se>: + a motivation letter + an

75,2015,phd position in quantifying insect  vision for biorobotic inspiration," i would like to announce the opening of the following phd position in the baird/dacke lab in the lund vision group at lund university in  sweden . the position will be available in early 2016. for more detailed information and expressions of interest please contact emily baird (emily.baird at biol.lu.se). project description: flying bees are able to use visual information to control flight and navigate in visually distinct environments, ranging from dark cluttered rainforests in the tropics to the open tundra of the arctic circle. does the efficiency with which different bees perform visually guided tasks in their diverse native habitats depend on specialized flight control systems, or do many use similar, inherently robust, schema? recent work in our lab has shown that variations do exist in the eye morphology within single bee genera where species are native to different habitats. this suggests that specialisations do occur - at least in the sensory structures that extract visual information from the environment. yet, environment specific specialisations are poorly characterised and it is unknown how they lead to functional differences in behaviour between species. the aim of this project is to investigate how evolution has shaped the visual flight control systems of bees, enabling them to safely guide their flight through the diverse range of environments that they inhabit. the project will involve quantifying the anatomy and flight behaviour of different species and using this information to generate mathematical models and simulations of guidance systems that will then be implemented on small flying robotic platforms to both test the validity of the biological principles that we discover and to develop useful, lightweight and efficient systems that can be used to safely guide autonomous robots through different natural environments. the anatomical focus of the project will be to use information from advanced micro computed tomography techniques, performed at synchrotron light sources, to construct functional optical and anatomical models of the eyes (left) and peripheral brain structures of several bee species. simulations based on those models will allow us to understand what information bees perceive in different visual environments and to relate each specialisation to the visual cues available in the habitat it evolved in. behavioural experiments will be performed at our field-sites in brazil, . and  sweden , and in our state-of-the-art laboratory setup in  sweden . the focus of behavioural experiments will aim to elucidate how any identified anatomical specialisations influence specific species ability for flight control and navigation. the results of this study will provide fundamental insights into task and environment specific visual processing strategies used by small insects in flight. through our close collaboration with the laboratory of intelligent systems at the swiss federal institute of technology, we aim to develop the principles that we learn from this study into guidance strategies that can be implemented on small flying robots. qualifications: the applicant should have demonstrated experience with computational and quantitative analysis of experimental or simulated data sets. a background in engineering or computer science is preferred but candidates with other backgrounds will be considered if technical competence can be demonstrated. previous experience in programming and image analysis using matlab (or another programming language) is highly desirable."

 robotics is a rapidly evolving technology that allows for fast, low-risk  and low-cost tasks with a worldwide market of over 80 billion dollars  over the next few years. in particular, aerial robots, also known as  drones, provide a breakthrough to easily image and access all sorts of  terrains and situations and are useful for instance in surveillance and  forensics, emergency industrial inspection or a search and rescue  operation. a major difficulty for their global acceptance is the  difficulty for controlling their flight and interacting with them. indeed, aerial robots are generally operated using a (central) ground  station which is not compatible with the time pressure required by  emergency conditions, for instance when rescuing a person out of reach with the ground station. this phd project  aims at concealing such obstacles and construct an aerial robot which is  able to be autonomously and interactively controlled by simple human  gestures, for instance that of a rescuer. the main scientific challenges  are (i) to embed in the aerial robot all the electronics for the visual  system from the retina to the control signals to the propellers, (ii) to  very quickly recognize a variety of simple gestures on-board using a  neuromimetic architecture and (iii) to make the robot react in real time  to these gestures. as such, this project is inter-disciplinary by  positively combining advanced algorithms from event-based bio-inspired  computer vision and the latest technology in aerial robots. first, the project will aim at using bio-inspired methods to remove the  three mentioned obstacles. biological vision, contrary to conventional  processing, is not using frame-based information or clock-based  processing. indeed, it is computationally more efficient to take full  advantage of the dynamic nature of the visual scene: biological vision  is relying on neurones working in parallel networks and coding the  spatio-temporal information of the visual scene into asynchronous spike  trains. thus, biological visual processing, starting at the retina, is  totally asynchronous and event-driven, and their artificial counterparts  can be efficiently modelled [1]. event-based dynamic vision provide a  novel and efficient way for encoding light and its temporal variations  by registering and transmitting only the changes when they occur.  neuromorphic vision sensors mimic biological visual processing by using  an array of interconnected neurons to simulate the neural network [2]  and such systems can output dynamic decision making signals which can be  used to steer the propellers. second, we intend to detect simple human gestures based on the semaphore  system which is based on characteristic hand and body movements. these  are well adapted as they are simple, fast and efficient to categorize  thanks to their unique spatio-temporal signatures. previous authors used  computationally intensive frame-based visual processing and classifiers  to recognize patterns made with different face poses and hand gestures  onboard uavs [3]. differently, we hypothesize that dynamic human  gestures contain characteristic statistics with respect to still images  such that they are more easy to categorize within these neuromimetic  systems. as a consequence, the present phd proposal will provide with a method to  control an aerial robot with hand and body gesture using a bio-inspired  asynchronous electronic architecture. we will first design the  neuromorphic retina able to generate spikes adapted to gesture vision.  then, the phd project will focus on signal processing methods to  identify human presence and associate efficiently series of spikes to  its body movement. the electronic architecture processing the visual  signals will be strongly inspired by the architecture of neural  networks, and therefore will be preferably using clock-less  microcontrollers (such as the verilog-based tiempo clockless 16-bit  microcontroller) or at least an asynchronous computational unit (such as  fpga). an algorithm will then transform the perceived body movement into  control order to the aerial robot. last but not least, experimental  studies will be conducted using the mocap vicon system inside the  marseilles? flying arena.

88,2016,"two fully funded ph.d positions in  social robotics @ aass, orebro university,  sweden "," the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)  at ?rebro university has openings for 2 fully funded  phd  projects (4 years) in social robotics. the phds will specifically be on 1.) social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy and 2.) measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics. the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn). more information on each position and how to apply is provided below. the expected starting date for both phd positions is 1st of april. we want your applications no later than november 30, 2016. for formal inquiry contact: prof. amy loutfi (amy.loutfi at oru.se) research topics ---------------------------- topic 1: social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy mobile robotic telepresence is used as a social communication aid for older adults, with remote users steering the robot in its environment using feedback from a robot's sensors. for unfamiliar drivers, this often creates a heavy workload and therefore reduces focus on social interaction. one way to reduce the workload is to introduce autonomy to assist the remote user in operating the robot. sliding autonomy is a way to automatically adapt the level of autonomy depending on the current context.the researcher will study how sliding autonomy can be implemented in social robotic telepresence by taking into considerations non-verbal cues as well as social norms. the researcher will also study the effect of sliding autonomy on the workload for operating the robot, and on the associated interaction quality. the researcher will undertake two secondments: (1) an academic secondment to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, to work on interface design for teleoperated robots; (2) an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, germany, to study cost-effective solutions to support sliding autonomy. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2553&rmlang=uk topic 2: measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics initial studies on mobile robotic telepresence suggest that evaluation using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can lead to a greater understanding of the perceived safety and security. the research goal for this particular position is to test this hypothesis, and to extend the work to include autonomous robot systems operating at varying levels of autonomy, and with varying levels of social behavior. the end result will advance the soa regarding autonomous systems supporting independent living with respect to: (1) the systems? ability to increase the sense of safety and security, (2) the relation between interaction quality, level of autonomy and sense of safety and security, and (3) new quantitative measures that can support qualitative evaluation tools. during a secondment  to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, evaluation procedures will be compared and combined. during an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, alternative approaches to evaluation of social robots will be investigated and compared, possibly leading to modified procedures. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2554&rmlang=uk about ?rebro university and aass ----------------------------------------------- ?rebro university is seeking outstanding candidates for two phd positions in computer science at the center of applied autonomous  sensor systems. the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass), carries out multi-disciplinary research environment at ?rebro university in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer science. successful applicants will join the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.oru.se_aass&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=b66frycb1clpvv8uaass4d8a5cuxijz2xy1n8fnefow&e= ) at ?rebro university,  sweden . salaries for phd students at ?rebro university are internationally competitive. with over 40 senior researchers and phd students, aass is one of the largest robotics research groups in  sweden . the research and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic, and phd students come from many different countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds. about socrates ------------------------- the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn) comprising  7 universities/research institutes: ume?

adaptive sampling strategies. the interaction between the auvs and a shore/ship-based decision support system requires acoustic communication. indorse aims to achieve its objectives through 1) analysing the dynamics of the dispersal of drill cuttings and how to observe it, 2) utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical models of the process, 3) analysing the feasibility and quality of acoustic communication between auvs and installations, and 4) developing, testing and demonstrating key elements of the monitoring system. the project will employ a phd student dedicated to system analysis, sampling theory and the establishment of technology requirements, and a post.doc researcher with focus on technological solutions including fully autonomous control for sampling.   the phd candidate will contribute to the project within the following areas: system analysis: analysis of the dynamical system (ocean dynamics, release, particle size distributions, transport and settling of material): temporal development, spatial extent and shape of the area of interest. this work will utilize existing mathematical model systems as simulation and test environment. sampling theory: adaptive sampling strategies for drilling scenarios, focusing on what features need to be observed at which spatial resolution to observe the system. use of simplified models through machine learning, and optimization based methods for path planning to maximize expected information value from measurements. establish methods to find optimal sampling strategies. technology requirements: establish methods to calculate the demands put by the system to be observed on the number of observation platforms, their performance and their sensor packages. job advertisement:

year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

develop  an active control technique to stabilise an abs in order to improve ride  quality. the vibration of the patient compartment in an ambulance can  cause secondary harm to a patient and can handicap emergency responders  in performing onboard care. the proposal will investigate a novel scheme  based on a local model network to control an ambulance bed rolling and  pitching thereby providing a vibration free ride. a local model (lm)  based on a mathematical representation of the abs dynamics will be  created at different operating regions to represent the abs as closely  as possible to real operating conditions. genetic algorithms (gas) will  be used to define the optimised operating regions and the structure of  the optimal local models. innovative multi-sensor-data-fusion techniques  will also be established to combine data from a number of sensors to  provide robust and reliable information on acceleration modes. finally,  a local controller network control scheme will be developed to achieve a  vibration free ride and stability analysis of the controllers will be  conducted to ascertain their robustness. the student will be a member of

* mobile robot olfaction: mobile robot olfaction (mro) is concerned with mobile robot systems equipped with an artificial sense of smell and suitable other environmental sensors. applications range from finding gas leaks to surveillance in the context of climate research. to address key problems in mro (e.g., gas discrimination, modeling gas distributions and finding gas sources), analytic domain models are of limited use: typically only crude sensor models are available and gas dispersal is a chaotic process in non-artificial environments at non-microscopic scales. see also

padding of variable stiffness to plastic parts that need to be snapped into a fixture, cartons that need to be folded and packed tightly, etc. similarly, there are numerous potential applications of deformable object manipulations in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine such as fruit picking and suturing. this project aims to  focus on further developing machine learning and control theory foundations of modeling and predicting a deformable object's interactions with a robot directly from available vision and force sensor data. the project's goal is to develop models learned from sensor data which map the robot actions to the expected changes of the environment and the deformation state of the object while respecting physical constraints. such models are a key ingredient for model-based control and model-based reinforcement learning in the context of robotic manipulation. the project will focus in particular on objects that are deformable but exhibit some degree of stiffness, such as plastics, metal sheets, etc. -- one position is advertised at chalmers university of technology, gothenburg,  sweden  under supervision of  yiannis karayiannidis, systems and

171,2019,wo full-time phd positions in ai and  robotics @chalmers," dear colleagues,  ?we are pleased to announce two phd research positions at the chalmers  institute of technology in gothenburg,  sweden . the application deadline  is 15 july 2019. we are looking for two talented and motivated researchers that would  like to pursue a phd in the areas of ai and robotics. both positions  will start in september 2019 or soon after that. each position is  limited to a maximum of five years. we are looking for candidates for  the following topics: *topic one: intelligent agents that learn from their past experiences  (ref 20190206) description: embodied artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary  area that requires the cooperation of different fields such as computer  science, engineering, robotics and dynamical systems. this phd thesis  will develop a novel learning algorithm to allow high-level  intelligence, such as problem-solving and reasoning to be applied to  real-world physical systems, e.g. robots. mainly, this work will be  focused on investigating learning methods on the semantic aspects of  intelligence to develop general purpose solutions for robotic applications. the goal of this phd thesis is to develop compact and flexible model  representations to allow robots the transference of their past  experiences to current situations. these compact models should be  human-readable to provide adequate feedback to the person interacting  with the intelligent agent, e.g. a robot. this feedback should provide  information to users, in an efficient form, about possibly hazardous  situations and potential errors, by predicting ahead-of-time the actions  performed by either a human or a robot to infer their potential  consequences. thus, the communication between the users and the robots  should be meaningful and bi-directional. further information about this position, please visit:  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.chalmers.se_en_about-2dchalmers_working-2dat-2dchalmers_vacancies_pages_default.aspx-3frmpage-3djob-26rmjob-3d7420-26rmlang-3duk&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=pfedqnjtk7yjutiw1bohfbiv6jt5hsnysjtio6wicfq&s=wzpwssal7lk5_6tggpv0giserkroi8skf8zd94cu1cw&e=  *topic two: learning & understanding human-centred robotic manipulation  strategies (ref 20190182) description: human-robot collaboration is one of the most promising  applications of autonomous robots. for this, robots need to interact  with humans in a meaningful, flexible and adaptable manner, especially  when new situations are faced. currently, the new emerging technologies  such as virtual reality and wearable devices allow capturing natural  human movements of multiple users. then, the next generation of learning  methods should take advantage of and bootstrap the learning of new  activities by adapting to the massive processing of information obtained  from these enhanced sensors. the goal of this phd project is to develop semantic-based learning  algorithms able to cope with a large amount of data generated from  multi-modal/multi-level sensors and react to dynamically changing  environments in real-time to produce robots with enhanced autonomy  levels and manipulation capabilities. the massive collection of data  will also contain information about the different styles of human  demonstrations which will help in developing a more human-centred  control solution. further information about this position, please visit:  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.chalmers.se_en_about-2dchalmers_working-2dat-2dchalmers_vacancies_pages_default.aspx-3frmpage-3djob-26rmjob-3d7387-26rmlang-3duk&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=pfedqnjtk7yjutiw1bohfbiv6jt5hsnysjtio6wicfq&s=cjjfpyepgf1phm0yigajaavkaavdhzcnx6oinncfokm&e=  both phd positions are offered at the department of electrical  engineering in the area of systems and control within the mechatronics  group. we offer a dynamic and international work environment with about  200 employees from more than 20 countries, and with extensive national  and international research collaborations with academia, industry and  society. chalmers offers a cultivating and inspiring working environment  in the dynamic city of gothenburg. *qualifications* by the starting date, the applicant should have a master of science  degree or equivalent in electrical engineering, computer science,  applied math or in a related discipline. a successful applicant should  have a strong background in machine learning methods and robotics as  well as be familiar with reasoning methods and ai tools. programming  skills in c++ are strongly required and knowledge in ros (robot  operating system), python, prolog, unity, and c#?
