project details
===========
project number: fp7 strep project number 248497
project title: trident: marine robots and dexterous manipulation for  
enabling autonomous underwater multipurpose intervention missions.

abstract
======= 
trident proposes a new methodology for multipurpose underwater  
intervention tasks with diverse potential applications like underwater  
archaeology, oceanography and offshore industries, going beyond  
present-day methods typically based on manned and / or purpose – built  
systems.
a team of two cooperative heterogeneous robots with complementary  
skills,  an autonomous surface craft (asc) and an intervention  
autonomous underwater vehicle (i-auv) endowed with a dexterous  
manipulator, will be used to perform underwater manipulation tasks.  
the proposed methodology is based on two steps.
during the first step, the i-auv is deployed from the asc to perform a  
cooperative path following survey, where it gathers optical/acoustic  
data from the seafloor whilst the asc provides geo-referenced  
navigation data as well as communication with the end user. during  
this phase of the mission the i-auv will be doing accurate path  
following and terrain tracking, to maximize bottom coverage and data  
quality. the motion of the asc will be coordinated with that of the i- 
auv to achieve precise usbl (ultra short base line) positioning and  
reliable acoustic communications. after the survey, the i-auv docks  
with the asc and sends the data back to a ground station where a map  
is set up and a target object is identified by the end user.  at the  
second step, the asc navigates towards a waypoint near the  
intervention area where the i-auv is launched to search for the  
object. when the object (i.e. the target of the intervention) has been  
found, the i-auv switches to free floating navigation mode. the  
manipulation of the object takes place through a dexterous hand  
attached to a redundant robot arm and assisted with proper perception.  
particular emphasis will be put on the research of the vehicles  
intelligent control architecture to provide the embedded knowledge  
representation framework and the high-level reasoning agents required  
to enable a high degree of autonomy and on-board decision making of  
the platform. the new methodology will allow the user to specify an  
intervention task, among a set of predefined ones, to be undertaken  
with regards to a particular target object selected by the end user by  
means of the map previously built. hence the intervention task is seen  
as a semi-automatic process where the target is manually selected but  
then it is automatically recognized and manipulated by the robot in a  
complete autonomous way.
the trident project brings together research skills specific to marine  
environments in navigation and mapping for underwater robotics, multi- 
sensory perception and a range of control techniques relating to  
intelligent control architectures, vehicle-manipulator systems and  
dexterous manipulation.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for auv  
navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to merge  
conventional dvl-fog navigation techniques with the recent results in  
sonar based scan matching in the context of the simultaneous  
localization and mapping techniques in order to setup a consistent and  
accurate elevation map of the seafloor. because sonar can see far  
away, it will be of interest to study how to deal with range scans  
gathered a different altitudes having then a different scale factor.  
hierarchical map structures able to accommodate these measurements  
will be studied.

vacancy 2: autonomous surface craft (asc) – autonomous underwater  
vehicle (auv) cooperative navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to use  
cooperative navigation techniques to accurately localize one or more  
auvs with the help of a dgps-equipped autonomous surface craft (or  
drifting buoy) being all the vehicles connected by means of low cost,  
low bandwidth acoustic modems. first the scenario of using an usbl in  
a direct configuration (transceiver mounted on the ship) will be  
explored and a solution explicitly taking into account the time delays  
due to the signal transmission will be proposed. then the sensorial  
requirements will be relaxed exploring the possibility of localizing  
the auv with the only help of range measurements (received for free  
with the acoustic data packets) arriving asynchronously from known  
positions (the surface craft pose). a dvl-mru equipped auv will be  
first considered, removing then the requirement of using a dvl.

vacancy 3: intelligent control architecture.
=================================
this vacancy is related with work package 3, which is responsible for  
providing the embedded knowledge representation framework and the high- 
level reasoning agents required to enable autonomy and on-board  
decision making of the platform. autonomous capabilities for  
intervention missions require heterogeneous embedded agents working in  
a dynamic operational field with hard and unpredictable environmental  
conditions. embedded agents specialise in different disciplines  
providing different capabilities or services to the overall system,  
i.e. navigation, mapping, vision, etc. this position will be related  
with the design and implementation of a path-planning agent. the main  
goal is to develop new algorithms for adaptive waypoint-based  
trajectory planning including path following, terrain following and  
obstacle avoidance. as a secondary goal, the work will also contribute  
in the design of an adaptive goal-based mission planning agent.

requirements:
===========
academic: excellent academic grades. knowledge in robotics, video/ 
sonar image processing. previous experience in navigation, mapping,  
slam techniques and/or control architectures will be appreciated. a  
master degree in the related areas will be valuable but not imperative.

project number: fp7 strep grant agreement 248942
project title:    roboearth: robots sharing a knowledge base for world
                    modelling and learning of actions

abstract
=======   
roboearth is a world-wide platform which robots can use to exchange
position and map information as well as task-related, hardware
independent action recipes. this will enable manufacturers worldwide
to break down their costs and efforts for reproducing software algorithms
for robot behaviour over and over again. the roboearth framework can
store all relevant data from algorithms to complex behaviour descriptions
what allows robots to act autonomously in an unknown, unspecified
environment. especially in the field of interaction with humans roboearth
can bring forward the behaviour of robots and simplify the software
design for developers in that field.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for mobile 
robots navigation.
=============================================================
the initial goal is to investigate the integration of odometry,
visual senors and laser for a safe collision free map building
in an unknown environment exploiting the available roboearth
priors. robot motion goal is to improve the available scene map.
visual sensor calibration both extrinsic and intrinsic is considered
only weakly known in order to preserve the system hardware independence.

in a second stage, the goal is to perform the safe navigation and
map building using only visual sensors and odometry. visual sensors
calibration would be only weakly known in order to preserve the
system hardware independence.

vacancy 2: semantic based mapping
=============================================================
the main objective is to research how to exploit a world wide database
in the appearance mapping process. on one hand, the prior information
available in the data base has to be exploited to improve the mapping
method, focusing the recognition and localization of objects intended
for interaction with the robot. on the other hand, the information
gathered during the robot operation has to be processed by learning
methods in order to enrich the information contained in roboearth database.

the project proposes to investigate techniques 
for a multi-robot team to act coordinately and cooperatively. this involves
planning, navigation, perception with different 
sensors, learning and communications.

the task of the selected candidate towards the phd is in the following context:

title.- cooperative missions with connectivity restrictions.
summary.- the team of robots should cooperate in 
perception, action and communications. one key 
topic inside the cooperation is to share the 
information. the research proposed for the 
student towards the phd aims to reply to the 
questions: ""which"", ""when"" and ""how"" the 
information owned by each robot should be shared. 
it is assumed that the team of robots must carry 
out the mission in conditions of 
restricted  bandwidth and network connectivity. 
part of the research will be focused in the 
construction, actualization and planning of 
communications maps integrating geometric and 
topological information, as well as 
communications coverage. its is very important to 
classify the information to be shared when 
carrying out cooperative perception or navigation 
just to maintain the functional and temporal 
integrity of the mission. in networks with 
bandwidth restrictions the amount of information 
to be shared should be minimized. the security, 
the bandwidth and the temporal constraints should 
be guaranteed by the proposed wireless protocols.

safe active semantic visual mapping and navigation
------------------------------------
visual slam research has been focused in the ability to locate a camera 
with respect
to an a priory unknown scene, under very general conditions and reducing 
the assumptions
about the observed scene. the resulting map composed of geometric 
entities such as points
and edgeles, normally has a reduced capability to represent the scene.

in the proposed research it is assumed that the robot has rich knowledge 
about the scenes
being observed because the roboearth object database is available. the 
goal is to build a map composed
of traditional meaningless geometrical entities plus the recognized 
objects in the database,
resulting in a map where objects the robot has to interact with are 
precisely located.

the robot has to exploit the map information to plan the motions and 
safely navigate in order
to locate the objects needed for a given task

*research topic: planning and navigation techniques for multi-robot 
teams in navigability maps.*

the research will address the problem of cooperative motion planning 
and  navigation for multi-robot teams in navigability maps. the 
classical approaches of navigation planning in occupancy maps and 
uncertain maps only represent the occupancy and the geometric 
uncertainty in the environment. this research will extend to multi-robot 
motion planning in maps where, in addition to the occupancy of the 
static and dynamic obstacles and their uncertainty, other information 
will be modeled, such as maps of communications in the areas of signal 
coverage to maintain a given quality (qos), and / or information about 
the likely of finding relevant objects or places in the scene.

this information will guide the planning of the trajectories for 
multi-robot systems within areas where it is likely to find the objects 
or places searched, or to have a good communication and dgps coverage. a 
model to represent that coherent and consistent heterogeneous 
information will be established. it will be oriented to motion planning 
with minimal risk or maximum success probability. probabilistic 
techniques will be used to represent information and to make coordinated 
navigation decisions consistent with the sensorial information.

application deadline: september 21, 2012 (12 noon, italian time)

application requirements:

strongly-motivated candidates holding a master degree in computer science / engineering / mathematics or other related fields are invited to apply. applicants should ideally have a background in machine learning, robotics or human-robot interaction, with strong mathematical and computer programming skills (matlab, c++ or equivalent).

application procedure:

to apply please send a detailed cv, statement of motivation, bsc and msc transcripts, degree certificates and other support material such as reference letters to dr sylvain calinon (sylvain.calinon at iit.it). the applicants also need to fill the online application procedure from the university of genova: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten .


the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a three year phd student position in
computer science at örebro university,  sweden .  the research area is
artificial intelligence and robotics, with special emphasis on
planning human-aware robot behavior.  the work will be performed in
the context of the eu project monarch.  application deadline: january
15, 2013.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the student will be to perform world-class research
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
specifically on the topic of planning human-aware robot behavior.  the
student will create, implement and test new techniques to allow a
robot, or team of robots, to generate plans to perform given tasks
that involve the interaction with humans.  what is new compared to
traditional planning is that these plans must ensure that the robot's
behavior complies with a set of social norms and social roles, which
may depend on the interaction context.

the research will be motivated by, guided by, and validated in a
specific application scenario: robots that interact with children in a
hospital, in order to entertain them or to participate in educational
activities.  depending on the context, robots may play different roles
and they may engage in different social relations with the children,
following different social norms.  for instance, robots may be
watchful guardians in some situations, or companion players in others.
the human-aware planning techniques developed in this research project
will take the social context, norms and roles into account, and
regulate the robots' behavior accordingly.

the successful candidate will be employed as phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  he or she will
work within the local monarch team at örebro university, but will also
collaborate with the other european partners in the monarch project,
both remotely and through physical meetings and research visits.  a
limited amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's
duties.

mapas sematicos visuales para escenas rigidas y no rigidas.
semantic visual mapping for rigid and non-rigid scenes.
main researcher j.m. martínez montiel

recent research is showing that computing medium-scale visual maps for 
rigid scenes in real time is
feasible. current maps, composed of a sparse set of points, are adequate 
for accurate camera
location, but quite poor for performing high-level tasks such as robot 
navigation, object manipulation
or human-computer interaction. furthermore, most available techniques 
are intensive in computer
requirements, being beyond the reach of small mobile devices.
our fundamental goal is to conduct cutting-edge research to push the 
limits of current visual mapping
techniques. more specifically, we propose to:
1. develop more efficient and robust techniques, able to build 
semi-dense maps (in the order of
thousands of points) for medium-scale environments. we will build a 
working demonstrator of a
distributed keyframe-based mapping and relocation system, where a light 
tracking process runs
on a small mobile computer, while the more expensive map optimization 
and storage can be
allocated on a separate machine, or as a service on the cloud.
2. develop scene understanding methods that boost the semantic contents 
of the map: object
recognition and insertion in the map, scene layout estimation, and scene 
recognition. we also
plan to address long-term mapping and apply learning techniques to 
determine which pieces of
information are obsolete or ephemeral and which are trustworthy for 
place recognition and
camera relocation.
3. research new computer vision methods able to deal with sequences of 
non-rigid scenes. our
specific approach is to embed finite element methods (fem) within the 
mapping algorithms in
order to exploit the rich models available from solid mechanics. we will 
target semi-dense
feature maps but also dense surface maps by exploiting variational 
methods and general-
purpose computing on graphics processing units (gpgpu).
4. perform extensive validation of all developed algorithms with real 
imagery in indoor and outdoor
environments. in the case of non-rigid methods, medical imagery coming 
from real live tissue is
targeted. a close interaction with surgeons and researchers in elastic 
models for biological
tissues is planned to achieve results that are significant in real 
surgical applications.

this is an ambitious proposal rooted on the strong published 
contributions of the research team to
the current state of the art in visual mapping, and the solid experience 
in building real-time mapping
demonstrators, which have fostered an intense technology transfer.

extended to multi-robot planning in maps that, in addition to the 
occupation of static and dynamic obstacles with uncertainty will reflect 
other information such as: maps of communications in areas of signal 
coverage to maintain a given quality of service (qos); information about 
the probability of finding objects or places relevant for the mission 
that will guide the trajectoryplanningavoiding areas where it is 
unlikely to find them; and coverage information of dgps. a model 
representing that heterogeneous information will be developed, which 
will be applied for coordinated motion planning a making decisions with 
minimal risk and ensuring communications connectivity within the robot 
team.

project summary

teams of robots for logistics, maintenance and environment 
monitoring(teloman)""(dpi2012-32100)

the research project involves deployment and actuation techniques of a 
multi-robot team. it is necessary to address problems of task planning 
and allocation, coordinated execution of the navigation, perception of 
the environment from multiple views from each of the team members, 
maintaining communication between all system components -- robots, 
infrastructure, bridges, monitoring equipment, etc. this project will 
address new goals and challenges for research and their application in 
real, large and complex scenarios. the research objectives are:

/- perception, learning and monitoring of the environment./to obtain a 
robust description of the type of environments where the robots are 
going to work, multisensor odometry techniques will be developed, which 
will integrate various devices onboard the robots (odometry, inertial 
sensors, 2d and 3d rangefinders, 3d vision, dgps, communications). the 
integrated information will be used for the construction of navigability 
maps that provide geometrical, topological and semantic information, 
quality and restrictions on communications, and information about dgps 
coverage. monitoring aspects include both, objects and people, and 
environment variables (temperature, humidity, etc). centralized and 
distributed algorithms will be developed for coordinating and 
integrating different partial perceptions provided by each robot in the 
team.

/- planning, navigation and multi-robot control./task planning and 
allocation take into account restrictions contained in various types of 
navigation maps and carried out according to various criteria (time, 
total distance, latency or average cost per task), keeping in any case 
the safety, the communications connectivity and a robust representation 
of the environment. to execute the plans, navigation techniques will be 
developed coordinating robots in dynamic environments in which people or 
other vehicles can share the scenario. the navigation techniques will 
allow the robot compliance with the changing environment, in which 
people or other vehicles can share the scenario with robots, monitored 
by the perception systems.

/- communications/. this module will address the development of 
propagation models of the interest signals (communications and dgps) for 
the construction of navigability maps. this modeling is also considered 
essential for bandwidth restriction imposed by an ad-hoc multi-hop 
wireless real-time network, which is composed of several robots and 
sensor nodes or bridges. in this sense we will investigate new protocols 
for increasing the bandwidth (e.g. tdma, spatial reuse) and new 
algorithms that optimize the information flow.

for the evaluation of the techniques, two types of application scenarios 
have been selected, each of which presents different problems to be 
solved: (1) logistics and transportation in indoor and outdoor scenarios 
(industrial parks, mines), in which the problems to solve focus on 
building robust models of the environment, task planning and allocation 
for the team of robots and coordinated navigation with communications; 
(2) the maintenance and monitoring of road tunnels, in which the 
deployment of robots, communication nodes and sensors must be specially 
considered taking into account the restrictions on communications 
connectivity.

89,2016,"two fully funded ph.d positions in  social robotics @ aass, orebro university,  sweden "," the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)  at ?rebro university has openings for 2 fully funded  phd  projects (4 years) in social robotics. the phds will specifically be on 1.) social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy and 2.) measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics. the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn). more information on each position and how to apply is provided below. the expected starting date for both phd positions is 1st of april. we want your applications no later than november 30, 2016. for formal inquiry contact: prof. amy loutfi (amy.loutfi at oru.se) research topics ---------------------------- topic 1: social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy mobile robotic telepresence is used as a social communication aid for older adults, with remote users steering the robot in its environment using feedback from a robot's sensors. for unfamiliar drivers, this often creates a heavy workload and therefore reduces focus on social interaction. one way to reduce the workload is to introduce autonomy to assist the remote user in operating the robot. sliding autonomy is a way to automatically adapt the level of autonomy depending on the current context.the researcher will study how sliding autonomy can be implemented in social robotic telepresence by taking into considerations non-verbal cues as well as social norms. the researcher will also study the effect of sliding autonomy on the workload for operating the robot, and on the associated interaction quality. the researcher will undertake two secondments: (1) an academic secondment to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, to work on interface design for teleoperated robots; (2) an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, germany, to study cost-effective solutions to support sliding autonomy. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2553&rmlang=uk topic 2: measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics initial studies on mobile robotic telepresence suggest that evaluation using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can lead to a greater understanding of the perceived safety and security. the research goal for this particular position is to test this hypothesis, and to extend the work to include autonomous robot systems operating at varying levels of autonomy, and with varying levels of social behavior. the end result will advance the soa regarding autonomous systems supporting independent living with respect to: (1) the systems? ability to increase the sense of safety and security, (2) the relation between interaction quality, level of autonomy and sense of safety and security, and (3) new quantitative measures that can support qualitative evaluation tools. during a secondment  to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, evaluation procedures will be compared and combined. during an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, alternative approaches to evaluation of social robots will be investigated and compared, possibly leading to modified procedures. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2554&rmlang=uk about ?rebro university and aass ----------------------------------------------- ?rebro university is seeking outstanding candidates for two phd positions in computer science at the center of applied autonomous  sensor systems. the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass), carries out multi-disciplinary research environment at ?rebro university in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer science. successful applicants will join the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.oru.se_aass&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=b66frycb1clpvv8uaass4d8a5cuxijz2xy1n8fnefow&e= ) at ?rebro university,  sweden . salaries for phd students at ?rebro university are internationally competitive. with over 40 senior researchers and phd students, aass is one of the largest robotics research groups in  sweden . the research and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic, and phd students come from many different countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds. about socrates ------------------------- the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn) comprising  7 universities/research institutes: ume?
