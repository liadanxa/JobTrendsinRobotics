collaboration between sintef ocean, sintef digital, ntnu department of engineering cybernetics and the center of excellence of autonomous marine operations and systems (ntnu-amos), and focuses on the spatial and temporal dynamics of particle dispersal from oil drilling, and methods and technology for observing the ecosystem. to adequately sample the local environment, this project calls for a swarm of autonomous mobile measurement platforms (including autonomous underwater vehicles or auvs) equipped with sensors measuring current, hydrography and suspended particle content utilizing adaptive sampling strategies. the interaction between the auvs and a shore/ship-based decision support system requires acoustic communication. indorse aims to achieve its objectives through 1) analysing the dynamics of the dispersal of drill cuttings and how to observe it, 2) utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical models of the process, 3) analysing the feasibility and quality of acoustic communication between auvs and installations, and 4) developing, testing and demonstrating key elements of the monitoring system. the project will employ a phd student dedicated to system analysis, sampling theory and the establishment of technology requirements, and a post.doc researcher with focus on technological solutions including fully autonomous control for sampling.   the phd candidate will contribute to the project within the following areas: system analysis: analysis of the dynamical system (ocean dynamics, release, particle size distributions, transport and settling of material): temporal development, spatial extent and shape of the area of interest. this work will utilize existing mathematical model systems as simulation and test environment. sampling theory: adaptive sampling strategies for drilling scenarios, focusing on what features need to be observed at which spatial resolution to observe the system. use of simplified models through machine learning, and optimization based methods for path planning to maximize expected information value from measurements. establish methods to find optimal sampling strategies. technology requirements: establish methods to calculate the demands put by the system to be observed on the number of observation platforms, their performance and their sensor packages. job advertisement:

year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

>  trondheim was  norway 's first capital city, founded more than 1.000 years ago, in 997 - but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

>  ntnu is  norway 's second largest university, with an annual budget of about us $800 million. its 51 departments are spread out over seven major faculties, and graduate about 3.300 students every year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

>  trondheim was  norway 's first capital city, founded more than 1.000 years ago, in 997 - but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

faculties, educating 39.000 students at any one time, of which half study technology and the natural sciences. ntnu graduates about 6.500 bachelor and master students every year, while about 380 doctoral degrees are awarded annually. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work. many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed at ntnu. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society.  trondheim was  norway 's first capital city, founded more than 1.000 years ago, in 997 - but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 187.353 (january 1, 2016), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."
16,2017,"postdoc position in lab le2i cnrs,  france"," the subject is part of safer-lc project (h2020), starting from may 2017 for a duration of 36 months. the main objective of safer-lc is to improve safety and minimize risks at and around level crossings (lcs) by developing a fully integrated cross-modal set of innovative solutions and tools for the proactive management and new design of level-crossing infrastructure. the project will focus both on technical solutions, such as smart detection services and advanced infrastructure-to-vehicle communication systems and on human processes to adapt infrastructure design to end-users and to enhance coordination and cooperation between different stakeholders from different transportation modes. the objective of the work related to the postdoc subject is to identify and understand the dynamics of the development of hazardous situations in lc environments. oppositely to manual diagnosis, performed by human investigations and observations, the task proposes to extend the temporal dimension of this diagnosis by exploiting automatically big databases provided by video system installed in lc for acquiring video sequences over long periods (several weeks). the proposed off-line automatic video analysis system will allow to refine/correlate human diagnosis with quantitative information (statistics and classification) extracted from the automatic system, and to extract behavioural models of user-to-user and user-to-infrastructure (lc) interactions. although this problem is widely addressed by researchers in different contexts, it constitutes a niche of open questions with scientific and technological locks. indeed, there is no generic user behavioural model for a given context, since it is necessary to take into account specificities (physic and socio-demographic) of each environment of the context, including the variety of users. furthermore, user behaviour depends generally to interaction that makes running one or several instantly situations, different types of users, and the infrastructure and its topology (user-to-user and user-to-infrastructure interactions). hence, the objective is to develop an intelligent video surveillance system able to model and analyze user behaviours, and extract useful information that could help understanding of the hazard. this task proposes to exploit big data provided by video systems installed in lc environments for acquiring video sequences over long periods (several weeks) of time, as well as by other environmental sensing systems. the behaviour analysis will be performed off-line by video image sequence processing.  the task will be developed in collaboration with cerema (toulouse, france), dlr (germany) and ntnu ( norway ). the information that will be extracted by the surveillance system includes type and trajectory of users, structure and layout of the infrastructure (lc). output from other work packages of the project will be exploited in developing the intelligent video surveillance system. for example, typical factors behind common lc accidents will be used to select the types of lc to be evaluated in this task; and societal dimension of human behavior should be taken into account to complete and refine mathematical model and physical models). requirements: candidate with phd degree in computer vision/artificial intelligence. high experience and background in video processing, machine learning and programming is searched. excellent english communication capabilities are required. deadline to apply: 30 june 2017 information contact: yassine ruichek (yassine.ruichek at utbm.fr) -- view this message in context: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__robotics-2dworldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com_jobs-2dpostdoc-2dposition-2din-2dlab-2dle2i-2dcnrs-2dfrance-2dtp5716560.html&d=dwicag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=e2knhu7wcbwvrmufveuuxzymosbqemn0rzwgdzgyavo&s=20dunm8wors_-hf6udt_cwrbqdwarincm97uxfj7e8c&e=  sent from the robotics-worldwide mailing list archive at nabble.com."

<applewebdata://141f63df-3dd2-4346-a3b0-1652a633228b/%22>). the new field big data cybernetics is envisioned to combine methods from automatic control and multivariate data modelling in order to discover systematic structures in the spatial, temporal and property-profile domains, and to convert these structures into quantitative, human-interpretable information. the main goal is to translate ?big data? from a large number of sensor channels into ?smart data? represented by a combination of theory-driven and data-driven models, by combining science?s prior knowledge with nature?s unexpected patterns to identify the relevant structures and develop interpretable and useful models. the overlap between cybernetic subspace identification and chemometric partial-least-squares regression could for instance be a fruitful common ground for the desired high-dimensional, spatio-temporal modelling. the outputs from such models shall be intuitively understandable by humans, who then can use their background knowledge and creativity for further refinement and development. this means that black-box modelling, such as e.g. artificial neural networks or support vector machines, are not the focus of big data cybernetics. the applicants? methodological basis should include theory and tools for describing scientific knowledge in terms of both first-principles mathematical models as well as unexpected cluster and subspace structures in large data sets. it is required to document solid competence in at least one of the two fields of automatic control and multivariate data modelling, and the applicant must demonstrate a strong interest in merging these two fields. knowledge in system identification, nonlinear dynamics, feedback control and self-organization, signal processing, image analysis, visualization or machine learning is an advantage. thus, several different scientific backgrounds are relevant for this new interdisciplinary field. the candidate will join a research community at itk which was rated ""excellent from an international perspective"" in the norwegian research council?s evaluation of 53 ict communities in  norway  in 2012, as one of three ict communities to receive such a rating in the norwegian university and college sector. the position is announced at

faculties, educating 39.000 students at any one time, of which half study technology and the natural sciences. ntnu graduates about 6.500 bachelor and master students every year, while about 380 doctoral degrees are awarded annually. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work. many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed at ntnu. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society.  trondheim was  norway 's first capital city, founded more than 1.000 years ago, in 997 - but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 187.353 (january 1, 2016), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

25,2017,"phd fellowship in robotic vision and  data driven learning in marine robotics, ntnu"," phd fellowship at the dept. of engineering cybernetics, norwegian univ. of science and tech., trondheim deadline for applications: 2017-12-31 the phd position is related to a highly interdisciplinary project which targets fundamental research questions in the fields of robotic vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence (ai) and control theory for the use in microbiology and oceanography. the project aims to image, process, analyze plankton images taken from the upper water? column by a mobile autonomous underwater vehicle (auv) thereby autonomously target specific microbiological taxa. this phd project will build upon state-of-the-art machine learning methods including deep convolutional neural networks (deep learning) and support vector machines (svms) to enable optimal navigation decisions with an improved context awareness and the ability to classify microbiological images unsupervised and do so online onboard an auv. exploiting such relatively new concepts for which a huge amount of data is required and sufficient training data has to be generated with respect to an expected taxonomy is a significant challenge. labelling of new classes may require augmented taxonomic classification capabilities from a biological expert. in the next step the autonomous control part of the process pipeline will bypass input from a biological expert exploiting new self guided machine learning methods. in addition, the project will explore how to train a neural network with image data not only along the spatial but also temporal domain for information evolution. the successful candidate will be appointed for a period of 3 years, with possible extension to a fourth year if the candidate undertakes teaching related duties. requirements successful applicants must have a master degree in computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, cybernetics, physics or similar with a solid background in mathematical modelling and machine learning. education in robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and/or biological oceanography is an advantage. applicants are required to justify their candidateship by explicitly explaining their personal motivation and academic aptitude for pursuing a doctoral degree within this research field. applicants that expect to complete their master?s degree by summer 2018 can apply. applicants must have significant programming experience ideally in c, c++ and/or python and should be willing and able to go to sea. academic results, publications, relevant specialization, work or research experience, personal qualifications, and motivation and a desire to make an impact on critical societal problems will be considered when evaluating the applicants. the research of this project has civilian objectives. however, equipment restricted by export licenses and itar (international traffic in arms regulations) is being used in this research area. applicants that are citizens of  norway , nato countries, australia, japan, new zealand, or  sweden  are eligible. other applicants should provide evidence of eligibility to use such equipment for their application to be considered. it is a prerequisite that the phd scholar applies for and is granted admission to the ntnu phd studies as soon as possible after employment. ntnus phd-rules require a master degree or equivalent with at least 5 years of studies and an average ects grade of a or b within a scale of a-e for passing grades (a best). excellent english skills, written and spoken, are required. applicants from non-european countries where english is not the official language must present an official language test report. the following tests can be used as such documentation: toefl, ielts or cambridge certificate in advanced english (cae) or cambridge certificate of proficiency in english (cpe). minimum scores are: toefl: 600 (paper-based test), 92 (internet-based test) ielts: 6.5, with no section lower than 5.5 (only academic ielts test accepted) cae/cpe: grade b or a. formal regulations appointments are made in accordance with the regulations in force regarding terms of employment for phd candidates issued by the ministry of education and research, with relevant parts of the additional guidelines for appointment as a phd candidate at ntnu. applicants must undertake to participate in an organized phd programme of study during their period of employment. the person who is appointed must comply with the conditions that apply at any time to employees in the public sector. in addition, a contract will be signed regarding the period of employment. applicants must be qualified for admission as phd students at ntnu. see https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.ime.ntnu.no_forskning_phd&d=dwif-g&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=g-fjzkijwucu7-insjsinpagcazt39ag3u9ag5avhqo&s=dpyrelwn3ox3yy5hn9tsufxcywaw3c2hfg6pfilkpg0&e= <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.ime.ntnu.no_forskning_phd&d=dwif-g&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=g-fjzkijwucu7-insjsinpagcazt39ag3u9ag5avhqo&s=dpyrelwn3ox3yy5hn9tsufxcywaw3c2hfg6pfilkpg0&e=> for information about phd studies at ntnu. together with the application, include a description of the research work that is planned for completion during the period of the grant. salary conditions the position follows code 1017, salary grade 50 ?

about the position: we have a vacancy for a phd candidate in ""dynamic robot interaction and motion compensation"" at the department of engineering cybernetics. robotics for moving objects in manufacturing and health (romo) is a researcher project financed by the iktpluss program of the research council of  norway . the project is a collaboration between sintef digital and ntnu department of engineering cybernetics. in both manufacturing/process industry and the healthcare industry there is an augmented need for robots that can observe and interact safely with moving objects. in most applications, the motion of the objects is constrained, but since it is only partly known in advance, real time estimation is needed. the moving objects that the robot will act upon may be rigid or soft, depending on application, and the force used in manipulating or grasping has to be measured and controlled. furthermore, the robot needs to have the ability to do complex operations on the object whilst it is moving. in healthcare, assistive robotics require safe interactions with flexible objects (humans). automation of interventional procedures necessitates real-time methods for detection and compensation of motion as well as haptic feedback, in order to safely interact with patients and health personnel.  there are three specific scientific and technological objectives of romo: 1) develop methods for real-time extraction and tracking of features from medical ultrasound images and video images, 2) develop methods for real-time estimation and prediction of motion based on physical models and machine learning, 3) develop methods for closed-loop control of robot manipulator arms based on motion estimation and force feedback. the position reports to professor tommy gravdahl. job description: the doctoral candidate will contribute to the project within the following areas:   *   motion estimation and prediction: develop models suited for motion estimation based on first order principles. apply state-of-the art nonlinear state estimation techniques to estimate and predict the object's state, while simultaneously identify unknown model parameters and/or learn un-modelled dynamics.   *   dynamic interaction control: develop variable admittance control laws and employ optimization techniques or machine learning for tuning of control variables to achieve high-speed and high robustness interaction. develop algorithms for optimal reference trajectory generation for the approach phase.   *   experimental validation: the methods developed in the project will be demonstrated on two specific use-cases. the use-cases reflect relevant industrial and medical needs and purposes: 1) robot-assisted probe placement and alignment, and 2) manipulating objects on hanging conveyors. qualification requirements: the qualification requirement is completion of a master's degree or second degree (equivalent to 120 credits) with a strong academic background in

 we are looking for postdoctoral fellows in autonomous navigation and applications for robots in the agricultural domain. applicants to the positions must state which of these two areas is of interest. 1. autonomous navigation in order to exploit the great potential of robots in agriculture, these robots rely on accurate information on their own position and their surroundings. to be successful, agricultural robots must cope with challenging topology and dynamic obstacles. the robots must also be capable of seamless indoor-outdoor navigation. under these conditions, reliable and accurate localization cannot be achieved with satellitebased systems alone, so one will have to also incorporate data from other sensors such as e.g.: inertial sensors, cameras, laser scanners and ultra-wideband radars. in addition, these robots need to be equipped with the sufficient level of autonomy to be able to operate safely and reliably in a complex and dynamic environment. task allocation and scheduling tasks for one or multiple robots is an important research topic. the robots need to operate in areas where humans and animals have access, and therefore need to do this in a safe way. 2. applications several tasks in agriculture require precise manipulation in a complex and unstructured environment. this calls for new tool design, new control schemes and advanced machine vision to be implemented. we are looking for candidates who have experience in developing precision tools for the agricultural domain, such as harvesters, precision weeders and seeders, or similar systems. the faculty has a robotic setup that will be made available to the candidate. it is expected that the candidate uses this equipment to verify the performance of the suggested navigation systems with real scenarios. the thorvald robot to be used in the experiments is developed at nmbu. the candidate will have the opportunity to test the developed methodology on a wide variety of applications, as the robot is used by several different departments at the university. the university currently has several robots available for experiments and testing. the candidate will also have access to the research farm at the university. main tasks the main purpose of the post-doctoral position is to qualify for work in high-level scientific positions. a phd degree is required. 1. autonomous navigation the main task of the candidate will be to implement safe and robust autonomy in the agricultural environment, and in particular for robots that operate both in the indoor and outdoor domain. the main activities will be related to one or more of the following topics:   *   safe and robust navigation in the agricultural environment. this includes both indoor (without, or with poor gnss coverage) and outdoor environment.   *   obstacle avoidance in a dynamic environment.   *   safety, in particular recognition of dangerous situations for the robot and its environment.   *   optimal trajectory planning.   *   human-robot interaction.   *   certification and proven robustness.   *   system integration. 2. applications the main task of the candidate will be to implement efficient and robust manipulation in the agricultural environment. the main activities will be related to one or more of the following topics:   *   gripper design   *   algorithms for grasping in an unstructured environment   *   trajectory planning   *   machine vision   *   deep learning   *   ai required academic qualifications   *   phd in engineering cybernetics, robotics, control, or similar.   *   proficiency in mathematical modeling, control and statistical methods.   *   hands-on experience from implementing algorithms on real systems. the following experiences and skills will be emphasized:   *   experience with implementing kalman filters, particle filters, or similar.   *   experience with robot design and prototyping.   *   experience with navigation algorithms such as waypoint navigation, slam, etc.   *   experience from large research projects or industry.   *   experience with machine vision.   *   excellent programming skills, ros, c/c++,
