with the goal of promoting the same high standards of research and
education as its original pittsburgh campus. cmu qatar is located in
education city, an ultramodern 2,500 acre campus which currently hosts
branches of six of the world's leading universities. the campus provides
cutting-edge research facilities in a dynamic and multidisciplinary
environment.

carnegie mellon qatar is located in qatar's capital, doha, an
up-and-coming modern city with easy access to the world. qatar is a
small country on the east coast of the arabian peninsula. its abundant
reserves of natural gas have resulted in it having a gdp per capita
among the highest in the world. it is cosmopolitan, vibrant, yet
pleasant and safe. and of course, it was recently selected to host the
2022 fifa world cup

(we will start accepting applications for the pittsburgh position only
after the qatar position has been filled.)

ideal applicants bring together a strong systems background and a keen
interest in developing highly experimental systems. specifically,
applicants for this position should have an established research record
in some combination of the following fields:

    * distributed systems
