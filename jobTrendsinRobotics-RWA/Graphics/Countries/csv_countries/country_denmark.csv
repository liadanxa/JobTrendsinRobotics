2,2007,post. doc. jobs in active sonar in denmark and belgium,"active sonar perception inspired by bats

... at universiteit antwerpen, antwerpen, belgium, and university of
southern denmark (sdu), odense, denmark in the framework of the eu
project chiroping (01/02/2008 -- 31/01/2011).

chiroping is a multidisciplinary research collaboration between 4
universities in the area of sensing for autonomous systems.

the principal objective of the project is to discover how to engineer
embodied active sonar perception systems which can serve as a complement
to vision and facilitate the deployment of robotic systems in situations
where vision is infeasible.

the project will implement and evaluate two demonstration systems built
as biomimetic models of an insect gleaning and a water-trawling bat
species respectively. it will use a classic biomimetic methodology,
involving close collaboration between bat ethologists and roboticists.
it will proceed by identifying and measuring the relevant acoustic and
morphological parameters of a few carefully selected bat species,
reconstructing from that the bat's acoustic experience as it flies
through natural hunting tasks. from this data, computational models of
how the bat coordinates its acoustic, behavioural and morphological
choices during hunting will be elicited and implemented on appropriate
robotic systems.

the center for biorobotics at the university of southern denmark (sdu)
in odense seeks to recruit two new assistant professors.  these posts
are for 3 years in the first instance. 

the scientific goal of the centre for biorobotics is to tackle
questions arising from the acoustic behaviours of animals which cannot

wysiwyd will create novel ""transparency"" in human robot interaction (hri) by allowing robots to understand both their and human actions and to interpret and communicate them in human compatible intentional terms expressed as a language-like communication channel. wysiwyd will contribute to a qualitative change in human-robot interaction (hri) and cooperation, unlocking new capabilities and application areas together with enhanced safety and robustness. in this context it is fundamental that robots perceive humans and understand their communicative intentions. however, the most successful vision-based strategies for people localization are developed for ""at distance"" scenarios. these techniques are not well suited for typical ""face-to-face"" hri, where human detection is made difficult by occlusions and large variability in pose and scale.

the research of this postdoctoral project aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art in terms of visual perception for hri. we are looking for a highly motivated young researcher with strong motivation to work jointly in computer vision and robotics. this project will be carried out on the icub robot with the aim of implementing efficient tools for the detection of human body parts by using computer vision. we will develop new methodologies for detecting human body parts at close distance such as torso, arms and face with the goal of determining the intention of the human (gaze direction, relative position, hands configuration etc.).

the white paper can address all three aspects or focus  on one of them. the white paper much include: * name, affiliation, email address * a (max) 1.5 page position statement please submit  the white paper as regular text or as a pdf file. too  long white papers will be discarded. position papers that focus on  current research are not appropriate. a white paper should present a  future vision and not merely discuss state of the art. white papers should be submitted by **end of the day august 15** to   roadmapping at robotics-vo.org. late submissions may not be considered. we  will evaluate submitted white papers by 18 august and select people for  the workshops by 19 august. the workshop reports will use used as the basis for a synthesis of a new  roadmap. the nominal timeline is * august 2019 - call for white papers * sep - nov 2019 - workshops * dec 2019 - workshops reports finalized * jan 2020 - synthesis meeting @ ucsd * feb 2020 - publish draft roadmap for community feedback * apr 2020 - revision of roadmap based on community feedback * may 2020 - finalize roadmap with graphics design, ?

93,2020,postdoctoral position in swarm robotics  for industry 4.0 at the university of southern denmark," the university of southern denmark invites applications from qualified doctoral graduates for a 3-year postdoctoral position in the fields of swarm robotics, artificial intelligence, and industry 4.0. the position is based in odense, denmark, and will be hosted by the sdu biorobotics unit of the maersk mc-kinney moller institute. the position is available starting 1. december 2020 or as soon as possible thereafter. -- focus of this position -- fine-grained central planning and control have so far been prevalent in large-scale manufacturing. the approach is, however, not well-suited for highly dynamic and unpredictable environments, where modern versatile collaborative robots (cobots) operate. to enable more flexible and collaborative manufacturing, robots must collectively become more autonomous. swarm robotics is an approach to the decentralized coordination of large multirobot systems. in this approach, there is a focus on embodiment, where robots communicate locally with one another, either explicitly or through modification of the environment. by following the core principles of individual autonomy, decentralized coordination, and self-organization, swarm robotics systems can achieve a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and robustness. the focus of the research is to bring the key advantages of swarm robotics to industry 4.0. we envision a future in which centralized planning is limited to high-level decision-making, and where robots use swarm robotics to coordinate and cooperate locally. the successful candidate will be involved in tackling the fundamental challenges associated with bringing this vision to fruition, which include basic research and experimental validation in perception, control, and decentralized coordination. experiments will be conducted in sdu?s state-of-the-art industry 4.0 lab, which is the largest of its kind in denmark and houses the newest robotics technology, storage cells, mobile robots, ar/vr technology, and digital twin technology. -- the research environment -- sdu biorobotics' current research program focusses, inter alia, on bio-inspired and biomimetic robotics, in which nature's exploitation of unconventional principles is of considerable interest. the unit works closely with sdu?s i4.0 lab, sdu's advanced manufacturing programs, and sdu?s unmanned aerial systems center. the environment in the unit is international and the daily language is english. -- profile and qualifications -- the ideal candidate for the position will have: * a phd degree or equivalent in a relevant discipline; * a strong research and publication record commensurate with career stage; * documented research experience in the areas of artificial intelligence, swarm robotics, or advanced manufacturing robots; * a commitment to basic science, but with experience with relevant experimental work; * documented teaching experience in relevant undergraduate and graduate programs. -- contact information -- further information is available from the professor mso anders lyhne christensen at email andc at mmmi.sdu.dk. -- conditions of employment -- employment as a postdoc requires scientific qualifications at phd level. employment as a postdoc is temporary and will cease without further notice at the end of the period. research will be predominant in the position. teaching assignments can be agreed individually. furthermore, other types of assignments may occur to a limited degree. the faculty determines the distribution of the various assignments. the weighting of the different assignments may vary over time. the successful applicant will be employed in accordance with the agreement between the ministry of finance and the danish confederation of professional associations. please check links for more information on salary and taxation: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/international_staff/on*arrival/salary/salary*rates__;kys!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdjfupg-9$  and https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/international_staff/on*arrival/taxation__;kw!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdaoxzjqm$  -- the assessment process -- read about the assessment and selection process: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/-/media/files/om_sdu/ledige_stillinger/ansoegere/tek/assessment_and_selection_process_faculty_of_engineering.pdf?la=en&hash=64f935f2851b68926cc0e3f9e59488c076bd9002__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdf32iwzm$  -- application procedure -- the faculty expects applicants to read how to apply before applying: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/servicenavigation/right/ledige_stillinger/jobs/soegjob__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdkft0u0s$  the application must be in english and must include: * motivated application * detailed curriculum vitae * certificates/diplomas (msc and phd) * list of publications indicating the publications attached * a maximum of 3 examples of the most relevant publications. * please attach one pdf-file for each publication reference letters and other relevant qualifications may also be included. the application deadline is ***august 16 2020*** the university wishes our staff to reflect the diversity of society and thus welcomes applications from all qualified candidates regardless of personal background. apply here: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/service/ledige_stillinger/1107972__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mddtrzmnh$  best regards, anders lyhne christensen professor mso sdu biorobotics mmmi, det tekniske fakultet t 65 50 73 24 m 93 50 75 10 andc at mmmi.sdu.dk syddansk universitet campusvej 55 5230 odense m https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.sdu.dk__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdes8hetn$ <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.sdu.dk/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdbfnhq1f$ > [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://cdn.sdu.dk/img/sdulogos/sdu_black_signatur.png__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdocfrnz4$ ]"
