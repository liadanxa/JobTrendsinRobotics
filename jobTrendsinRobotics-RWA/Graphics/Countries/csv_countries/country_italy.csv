- grenoble
grenoble is 600k inhabitants city right in the middle of the french  
alps. it has a very big university and at least 10% of the population  
is made of students. grenoble activity is turned toward high  
technology industry and research. its domains of excellence are  
nanotechnology, computer sciences and electronic. all mountain  
outdoors leisure are next door (the closest ski resort is 30 minutes  
from downtown).

- emotion research group
the research group (www-laplace.imag.fr) is made of 25 persons  
(permanent researchers, engineers and phd students). it is a very  
international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

research topics proposed


theme 5.1 - machine learning


tutor: prof. giorgio metta

n. of available positions: 1

in the development of an advanced robot, such as humanoids, one is expected
to encounter very complex problems. examples of these hard problems are body
control and various types of visual processing. due to the complex nature it
can be nearly impossible to solve these problems by traditional engineering
methods that rely on exact modelling. a practical example is creating a
kinematic and/or dynamic model of a robotic arm, which is very difficult
since the model should incorporate many real-world interdependent aspects,
such as gravity or friction, backlash of components, tendon stiffness, etc.

a complementary approach is to use modern machine learning techniques (e.g.
support vector machines, artificial neural networks, evolutionary computing)
to tackle these problems in a highly automated fashion.

further, these techniques can be used to deduce useful models that are
derived from biology either because we have observed human behaviour or from
the evidence of neural sciences. this biological evidence can give valuable
inspiration in the creation of a humanoid robot that shows human-like
performance.

however, the biological solutions are generally not directly applicable in a
vastly different computational environment. computational intelligence
techniques, such as the ones mentioned before, could help to create abstract
models that can be implemented on a computer.

the ideal candidate would have a background on computer science or related
disciplines and a strong propension to mix theory and practice to analyze
machine learning problems mathematically but to simultaneously devise
plausible and viable implementations on the humanoid platforms available at
the rbcs labs.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:giorgio.metta at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.2 - language and action 


tutor: francesco nori

n. of available positions: 1

recent scientific theories have suggested that language is not a module
independent from other cognitive capabilities. there is in fact strong
evidence supporting the idea that language is instead deeply intertwined
with action. moreover, the interaction between action and language has also
been hypothesized to have had a crucial role in the evolutionary origins of
language.

as a consequence of these theories, the problem of building an artificial
system with linguistic capabilities cannot be considered as a purely
perceptual task. motor capabilities are instead as fundamental as the
perceptual ones. within this context, compositionality seems to play a
crucial role by creating a wide repertoire of actions trough the combination
of a handful of elementary primitives.

the candidate should explore the implications of these novel theories by the
implementation on an artificial platform, e.g. icub. the long term goal is
to build an artificial system with some intertwined motor and linguistic
capabilities.

the ideal candidate would have a background in computer science or
engineering, with good programming skills, propensity to reuse existing
tools (e.g. asr, machine learning) and components (e.g. robot control
software) but at the same time to develop new algorithms to solve specific
problems which might not be well-structured or formalized.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
francesco.nori at iit.it


theme 5.3 - active perception in humanoid robots


tutor: dr. lorenzo natale

n. of available positions: 1

neuroscience and developmental psychology strongly agree on the importance
of motor activity for perception and learning. growing experimental evidence
demonstrates how areas directly related to motor production/generation are
involved during perceptual tasks (action recognition, speech perception).
during development, motor abilities like reaching and grasping allow infants
to explore their own body and the environment and extract information using
multiple sensory modalities at the same time (e.g. vision, sound and touch).
infants spend a huge amount of their awake life experimenting the rules
governing the world and their own body. they move their arm, legs and hands
and observe the results of their actions while banging, crashing and biting
objects.  researchers in robotics have taken inspiration from these
observations and investigated how motor activity shapes and enhance
perception in artificial systems.

artificial perception is an extremely difficult task, which has been
challenging researcher in computer vision, robotics and artificial
intelligence for several years. despite great efforts only limited success
has been achieved. robotic applications suffer of these limitations. today
we find robots able to perform sophisticated tasks fast and accurately but
only in very controlled scenarios (typical example is industrial robotics),
where perception is totally absent or very simplified. but robots are much
more brittle in everyday scenarios, where perception is required to cope
with unpredictability.

the topic of this phd is the study of perception in robotics, with the goal
to explore how robots can exploit the interaction between their body and the
environment. applications are especially in the context of robot
manipulation, with particular interest in vision, auditory and haptic
perception and their integration. possible topics include control of
attention, robot self-recognition, grasping, manipulation and object
recognition. the optimal candidate should have a background in computer
science and engineering, and be interested to study the mechanism underlying
perception in biological systems. background in electronics and mechanics is
not a requirement, but considered that the phd will be carried out working
on a robotic platform, the candidate should consider that he might be asked
to contribute to system level design and low-level hardware and software
development.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
lorenzo.natale at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:lorenzo.natale at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.4 - human-robot interaction and the mirror-neuron system


tutor: prof. giorgio metta

n. of available positions: 1

the human mirror neuron system can be probed through human-robot interaction
experiments and the measurements of behavioural parameters (kinematics,
forces, gaze, etc.). in particular, experiments can be designed to measure
gaze during observation of actions performed by a humanoid artefact.
experiments will be devoted to clarify the characteristics of the observed
action that evoke pro-active gaze behaviour. the monitoring of eye movements
of human participants will be used to reflect the activity of a motor
resonance involving a mirror-neuron system. during the experiment we will
ask subjects, seated in front of the robot, to merely observe its actions.
by using the artefact, we will, for instance, investigate three different
cues. (i) role of the kinematics; (ii) modulation of the empathic link
between the robot and the subject ('enriched familiarization'); (iii)
subjects will be requested to act on some objects (by grasping and
displacing them or by putting some of them within a particular container)
while the robot looks at their actions.

simultaneously, studies on the goal of the action and of kinematic
parameters (transitive/intransitive actions) can be performed on human
subjects. in this set of experiments manipulation of both the plausibility
of the goal of the action and of the kinematic parameters of the movement
are devised. the experimenter and the subject will be sitting at a table,
one in front of the other. subjects will be given the instruction to watch
the action performed by the experimenter and then to repeat it. no explicit
instruction on how to imitate the observed action will be given to the
subjects. we will present both transitive and intransitive movements, and
the demonstrator will execute the movements with different kinematics. these
sets of experiments and the corresponding gaze/reaching/grasping kinematic
recordings will constitute a database which can be subjected to various
modelling efforts, for example through non-parametric and machine learning
techniques. 

the ideal candidate would have a background in human psychophysics and/or
related disciplines.

giorgio.metta at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:giorgio.metta at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.5 - whole body motion for humanoid robots


tutor: dr. sophie sakka

n. of available positions: 1

the kinematics of a humanoid robot is close to humans. still, some
unavoidable differences appear which make the imitation of human motion by a
humanoid robot a difficult task. during this ph.d. program, the research
will focus on whole body motion for humanoid robots, using human captured
motion as a basis model, and converting them into motion compatible with the
kinematic constraints of a humanoid robot.

after implementing traditional approaches for whole body motion generation,
the candidate will work on improved models allowing an autonomous imitation
of baby-like locomotion. a special attention shall be paid to the transition
between crawling-based displacements, including them into a pertinent
definition of variable support polygons during locomotion and control of
posture changes (four-leg crawling -> sitting -> four-leg crawling ->
standing up using hand grasping for standing up).

the ideal candidate would have a background in computer science or
engineering, control theory, modelling and robotics.

for more details concerning the research project, please contact:
sophie.sakka at lms.univ-poitiers.fr
<blocked::blocked::mailto:sophie.sakka at lms.univ-poitiers.fr> 

 


theme 5.6: composite materials based on carbon nanotubes for robotics


tutor: dr. davide ricci

n. of available positions: 1

the evolution of humanoid platforms designed to collaborate with humans will
be from rigid toward soft components specifically addressing technologies of
skeletal, actuation and sensorial components in an integrated way. within
this framework, a fundamental technological issue is the development of
elastic actuators composed of fibers with mechanical properties similar to
those of biological muscles. while the ultimate goal could be considered the
development of organic muscles, the intermediate approach this ph.d. project
will follow is the development of more traditional actuators that take
advantage of the properties of hybrid nanocomposite materials. the main
issues to be addressed are: power/weight and power/volume performance,
compliance and stiffness regulation, robustness, control behaviour. to this
end, the ph.d. research work will be devoted to the development of ""soft""
materials based on an appropriate blending of polymers and carbon nanotubes
capable of actuation. incorporation of other functionalities such as power
storage, electron transport and force transfer within a single engineered
structure will be also pursued.

the ideal candidate would have a background in one or more of the following
fields: material science,  sensor and actuators,  micromechanics,
nanotechnology.

theme 5.7: dexterous hand for humanoid robots


tutor: dr. lorenzo masia

no. available positions: 1

humanoid robot kinematics must mimick the human motion. in order to
reproduce movements and dynamics closest to human's ones, a humanoid must
have a high number of dofs.

actuaction plays an essential role in dynamics and kinematics; human body is
powered by muscles and tendons in a redundant configuration in a variable
impedance control strategy.

available actuators on market are nowadays characterized by a small
bandwidth and high weight-power ratio: this means  in order to have a system
behaving with a dynamic comparable with human's one, it must be actuated by
small inertia (and power) actuators.   the main idea is to turn around the
problem by developing a modular robot in which each module has its own
dynamic behavior and actuators: a hybrid system. 

objective of the research is to design and characterize a 9 dof  biomimetic
inspired hand 

to be coupled with a humanoid robot available at iit robotic lab. the
candidate must design the hardware meeting the requirements and characterize
it investigating kinematics and dynamics.

this project is entitled ""rossi; emergence of communication in robots 
through sensorimotor and social interaction"", and focuses on the 
development of communication between robots and humans 
(http://www.rossiproject.eu).
in particular, the project is addressing the question of how critical it 
is for communicating agents to share the same general view of the world. 
  agents possessing different sensory and motor systems may have 
different views of the world and therefore may have difficulties in 
communicating. we are exploring to what extent and which aspects of 
world models must be shared in order to facilitate communication between 
robots and humans.  we wish to increase understanding of the 
requirements of affordance based world models, shared models and 
communication provided by such models, based on understanding of 
objects, actions, and processes in their environment. the focus of this 
project is the construction of robots that are able to process simple 
commands and to respond appropriately by interacting with different 
kinds of objects and entities in their environment. this project has 6 
partners in italy, germany,  sweden  and turkey, involving psychologists, 
neuroscientists, computer scientists and robotics engineers. we are 
involved in all stages but especially the implementation of the models 
in a robotic manipulation system and the testing and experimentation 
with real application tasks.

we wish to appoint a post-doctoral research associate who will take 
major responsibility for the programme of research in the context of our

research topics proposed
theme 5.1: humanoid robot tactile sensing system
tutor: prof. giorgio metta – prof. valle
n. available positions: 1

tactile sensing is the process of detecting and measuring a given property
of a contact event in a predetermined area and subsequent pre-processing of
the signals – before sending them to higher levels for perceptual
interpretation.  generally, tactile sensing is associated with the force
measurement, but - in view of the above definition - the tactile sensing in
robots should also include detection and measurement of object information
that cannot be deciphered from the force measurement only e.g. temperature. 
the ph.d. research activity will involve the development of tactile sensing
modules and hence of the skin parts for humanoid robots, their integration
with robot and subsequent use in the robot control loop for exploration and
manipulation tasks. the research activity will focus on a limited set of
candidate transduction technologies for contact sensing; piezoelectric
polymers, resistive, capacitive - being the most promising candidates for
measuring geometric and mechanical quantities. the possibility of having
transducers and conditioning electronics on same medium/substrate – with
transducer directly coupled with an electronic device (i.e. fet/tft device)
– will be explored. while the transducers can be placed either on flexible
(e.g. organic) or rigid (e.g. crystalline silicon) substrate – based on
their location on the robot’s body; the conditioning electronics will be
implemented on the silicon substrate.  besides improving the performance of
the sensing system, the approach is expected to provide a solution to wiring
complexity – a key problem in robotics. such a marriage of transducers (e.g.
smart materials like piezoelectric polymers) with fet or tft devices on
rigid (e.g. silicon), or flexible (e.g. organic or elastomeric) substrates,
would also improve the reliability. sensors readout and smart processing
tasks will be implemented with dedicated electronics embedded in the tactile
sensing array. the networking of the modules of tactile sensing arrays, so
obtained, is expected to result in a scalable system.
applicants should have a background in one or more of the following fields:
electronic engineering, microelectronics, computer science, sensors and
robotics. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills and
motivation to work in a highly competitive and multidisciplinary
environment.

giorgio.metta at iit.it


theme 5.2: neuromorphic sensors for humanoid robots
tutor: dr. chiara bartolozzi
n. of available positions: 1

biological sensory systems vastly outperform conventional digital systems in
almost all aspects of perception tasks, where the system must process noisy
and ambiguous stimuli to produce appropriate behavioral responses. digital
systems require vast amounts of resources to extract relevant information
from sensors, but still fail to produce appropriate responses for
interacting with the real world in real time. part of the reason for this
might be the fundamental differences in handling sensory data in biological
systems and machines. “frame-based” time sampling and quantization artifacts
present in conventional sensors are particularly problematic for robust and
reliable performance. on the contrary biological sensory systems make use of
continuous time, stimulus-driven, asynchronous, distributed, collective, and
adaptive principles, that make their interpretation of the external world
reliable and robust. the goal of this project is to introduce in the field
of robotic vision the principles of biological sensory systems design.
specifically we aim at combining the design of novel data-driven
biologically inspired sensory devices with the development of new
asynchronous event-driven computational paradigms, with structure and
morphology that are matched to the requirements of the robots body and its
application domain. the candidate shall work on testing of existing
asynchronous vision sensors and on the design of new sensors with
non-uniform morphology, using analog real-time low-power vlsi neuromorphic
circuits. the candidate will participate in the whole project development by
also tackling the problem of the realization of supporting data driven
asynchronous computational paradigms for machine-vision methodologies that
are radically different from conventional ones, and test the developed
vision system performance on advanced humanoid robotic platforms.
requirements:
applicants should have a strong interest in bio-inspired hardware
engineering and the ability to work independently. good skills in
programming c and matlab. fundamental notions of microelectronics;
background in neuroscience.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
chiara.bartolozzi at iit.it


theme 5.3: the role of actions for perception: improving perception
abilities of the humanoid icub
tutor: prof. giorgio metta – dr. lorenzo natale
n. available positions: 2

in modern robotic systems perception is too often inadequate and simplified.
this seriously affects the ability of robots to cope with unpredictability
and successfully interact in the real world. artificial perception is a
complex task, in which, despite great efforts in computer science, robotics
and artificial intelligence, only partial successes have been achieved.
the study of perception in humans shows that the brain takes advantage of
the integration of the wealth of information available from the different
sensory modalities, including information about the incipient action
generation. populations of multimodal neurons are responsible on one side
for controlling eye/head, arm, and grasping movements and, on the other, to
interpret actions performed by others, for the recognition of objects, and
to support goal-directed attention processes. the representation of the
world in the brain happens through the activation of multiple pathways and
involves the use of sound, vision, touch, and proprioception mixed with
activations describing the current motor context and the intended goal. this
requires a new way of looking at the problem of learning to extract relevant
information at each stage of processing. outstanding questions regards: how
do we represent the space around us? what visual features are important?
what is the relationship between sound, vision and touch? how motor
information structures the recognition process? of particular interest is
the determination of the link between object-related information and the use
of this information for the control of manipulation.
in this project we are interested in studying methods for improving the
perceptual abilities of the humanoid robot icub (http://www.robotcub.org),
with the goal of exploring ways of using and integrating sensory information
originating from the interaction between the robot and the environment. this
project requires the investigation and implementation on the robot of
several different elements ranging from sensory perception, to motor
control, and machine learning: for example, the realization of explorative
behaviors to extract information about the environment and objects. this
might include grasping and manipulation, but also simpler strategies like
pushing, prodding and squeezing objects. one of the goals here is to build a
representation of objects that goes beyond the level of the single sensory
modality (e.g. vision) but merges the visual appearance of an object with
the haptic sensation it produces when grasped, or the sound it produces when
touched. to reach this level of competency the robot would require the
control of attention and self-recognition.
we seek candidates with a strong background in computer science and
engineering, who are also interested in the study of perception and modeling
of biological systems. knowledge of electronics and mechanics is not
required but it might be useful considered that the successful applicant
will be working directly on a real humanoid robot.

phd themes
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
stream 1: telepresence, vr and haptics

researchers working in this area will work on the development of multimodal telepresence and haptic interaction paradigms, and hardware/software drawing on simultaneously displayed cutaneous and kineathesic experiences, the application of these technologies in human computer interactions and human centred robotics and the key psycho-physical testing of the experiences. the work will draw on expertise in engineering (mechanical and electronic) and computer systems. there may also be a small number of opportunities for researchers from a psycho-physics and/or psychology background.

 

 

theme 3.1: bi-manual semi-exoskeleton for enhanced teleoperation and virtual immersion

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis

n. of available positions: 1

 

the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of training or teleoperation procedures as these actions require the user to extensively engage his hand and fingers. in the recent years the rapid improvements in hardware and software to provide effective force/touch feedback has led to the development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various training simulators and teleoperation systems. in most of these instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered use are relatively poor. in addition these systems provide only point contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. to be of any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic interface. 

the development of a multi degree of freedom haptic system (based on exoskeletal systems) with large isotropic working volume, high backdrivability and multimodal feedback capability will be the core of this research.  

applicants ideally should have a background in one or more of the following fields: electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and robotics. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills and motivation to work in a highly competitive and multidisciplinary environment.

experience with cad and a good knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit. 

<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.2: integration of multimodal virtual reality system

tutor: eng. andrea brogni, dr. nikos tsagarakis

n. of positions: 1

 

virtual reality systems are daily becoming more complex, due to the evolution of different inputs, such as motion capture, 3d sounds, bio-feedback, haptic interfaces and robots. the integration and the mode of interacting in those multi-modal environments is a fundamental area of research for this field. different sensory streams are coming from different devices and making an interactive application implies deal with many different formats. 

the topic of the research will involve be studying the systems available in the department and the definition of a basic standard for the communications. the design and the development of a multimodal platform for the integration will be the second part of the research. the work will be based on previous studies and in collaboration with other researchers.

the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude to mix theory and practice, including programming c++ libraries and interfaces for hardware.

<mailto:andrea.brogni at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.3: interfacing a virtual reality environment with haptic interfaces and/or robots

tutor: eng. andrea brogni, dr. nick tsagarakis

n. of positions: 1

 

the sense of presence involves the human reactions during the virtual experience. how the user reacts, in behaviour, physiologically and physically, are key points for the evaluation of the level of engagement. using haptic interfaces and robots, we will introduce other feedbacks, i.e. touch and weight or the physical presence of avatars, that will effect how the user interacts and explore how the user behaves in this configuration? what is the best paradigm for the interaction? what kind of applications would be optimal for increasing the level of presence?

the topic of the phd will be studying the human approach in an immersive virtual environment, when a user has to deal with haptic feedback and robotics mechanism. in particular, the interaction with robotic avatars, human-like or machine, during specific collaborative tasks or experiences will be explored.

the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude to mix theory and practice, including programming c++ libraries, interfaces for hardware and 3d opengl graphics. experience in virtual reality and presence field could be an advantage.

<mailto:andrea.brogni at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.4: investigation of the physiology and psychophysics of the human fingertip.

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell

n. of positions: 1

 

the human fingers and particularly the fingertips are key to the haptic perception of contact with an environment, yet there is a comparatively poor understanding of the nature of finger tip sensing and perception. 

this work will involve a study of human tactile perception using a tactile array of vertical-moving pins in contact with the fingertip. it will investigate the sensory nature of the finger tip in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and psychophysics methodologies to evaluate human tactile performance and use this data to define and specify the design of haptic interfaces. it is also expected that the work will involve testing an use of fmri and mri scans.

the applicant ideally should have good background in psychophysics. experience in robotics and graphics opengl is an additional bonus but not essential. 

<mailto:darwin.caldwell at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.5: high fidelity telepresence control of a high dexterity robotic hand

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell

n. of positions: 1

 

the teleoperation there is often a poor mapping between the actions of the operator and particularly the hand movements of the operators and the movements of the robotic end-effector. this makes high precision, high fidelity manipulation of small or delicate object exteemely difficult or impossible.

this project will bring together several research threads considering the development of high fidelity input gloves and finger tracking systems, advanced feedback systems for the fingers  (hand exoskeletons, tactile array, thermal feedback) and miniature dextrous manipulators with over 23 dof and advanced tactile sensing.

applicants should have a strong engineering or physical science background.

<mailto:darwin.caldwell at iit.it>  

 


stream 2: humanoid robotics


 

research in this area will focus on all areas of hardware and to a lesser extent software development for humanoid robots. the research will involve the development of novel actuators, high dexterity end-effectors that will link with the haptics/telepresence research, novel tactile sensing, the use of new structures and materials and self healing, and self repair.

 

 

theme 3.6: human friendly actuation technologies

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderbroght

n. of available positions: 1

 

robot actuation has been traditionally based on the use of heavy, stiff position/velocity and torque actuation units coupled with rigid non back-drivable transmission mechanisms. these stiff actuation groups are usually implemented by combining dc-brushed or brushless or ac drives with planetary or harmonic drive gears and/or timing belts with a high gain pd control. these robots are optimised for precision and speed and are highly repeatable, acting within constrained and well defined environments. 

recently, with the introduction of new applications domain such as virtual/tele-presence, robot aided therapy/assistance, humanoids and personal/entertainment robotics and augmentation systems it has become increasingly clear that the traditional actuation approach is not suitable for addressing the performance requirements of these new application domains. the requirement for closer human-robot interaction have highlighted the need for robotic systems which can match the performance of biological systems in terms of ability to regulate displacements and impedance over a wide range of loads and motions enabling control of acceleration and force for enhanced performance, safe interaction and energy efficient task execution. these are key developmental features of all new generation systems. in fact, these requirements are directly linked to the actuation system. the lack of such an actuator unit that can mimic some of the properties of the natural muscle is probably one of the most significant barriers that prevented so far the development of robotic systems exhibiting bio-natural functional behaviour and performance. this limitation of the current actuation technologies is the inspiration for the research which will focus on the:

theme 3.7: bipedal walking for the humanoid robot ""icub"" 

tutors: dr bram vanderbroght and dr nikos tsagarakis

n. available positions: 1

 

the humanoid robot ""icub"" has been constructed within the european consortium robotcub. the legs have 12dof and are powered by electrical motors. in the first stage of system walking traditional control schemes will be implemented consisting of a trajectory generator and stabilizer. in the second phase stretched knee walking and the use of the toe-joint to make bigger steps will be studied. the last phase of the project consists of changing the hardware of the legs to implement compliant actuation and to adapt the control schemes to make benefit of the compliance regarding improved energy efficiency and adaptability regarding different terrains.

applicants should ideally possess a strong background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science  or physical system modelling and control.

theme 3.8: safe manipulation using compliant actuation

tutor: dr irene sardellitti and dr bram vanderbroght 

n. available positions: 1

 

the next generation of robotic manipulators will operate out of their safety cages and in close proximity with humans. safety hence becomes the primary concern in these devices. passive compliant actuation is the key for safe human-robot interaction, but control schemes controlling both torque and stiffness of every actuator to combine good tracking performances under a desired safety index are still missing. a manipulator actuated with adaptable compliant actuators developed by iit will be built. in the first stage the torque/stiffness needs to be controlled to safely track desired trajectories. in a second phase the manipulator will be controlled without the use of control elements as joysticks, but the user will directly manipulate the load which has to be sensed by the manipulator. preferable a strategy should be developed without using sensory information from torque/force sensors.

applicants should ideally possess a strong background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science  or physical system modelling and control.

this area will consider the development of hardware, software and sensory systems for biological inspired robotic systems.

 

 

theme 3.9: bio-natural functional locomotion systems and physical principles

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell  

n. of available positions: 1

 

a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot (called hyq) is currently being developed with the aim to study compact hydraulic actuation systems for legged robots and their control incorporating aspects of active/ passive joint stiffness regulation for energy efficient animal locomotion. this will including jumping and running. furthermore the robot will serve as a platform to test compact power systems as an alternative to batteries (petrol/gas combustion engines, fuel cells, etc) to make future robots power-autonomous for several hours. 

the final version of the robot will have the following estimated specifications: weight 70-80 kg (including 10kg payload), height less than 1m, four legs with three degrees of freedom each, hydraulic actuation systems, position and force sensing on joint level, compliance in joints.

the anatomical design of the legs has been inspired by the morphology of biological systems. the specifications for actuator performance result from dynamic simulations. a first prototype leg has been constructed and its performance is currently being tested.

 

positions are open to work on the development of energy efficient animal-leg mechanical systems which emulate the biological systems not only from the morphology point of view but also exhibit bio-natural functional behaviour and performance. this will include the development of actuation techniques allowing this behaviour to be simulated.  the ability to passively regulate the impedance of the actuator will be the key feature of the actuation units.

the first position will consider the locomotion of the robot. after studying different animal gaits such as walk, trot and gallop, dynamic simulations will test stability and efficiency of different control algorithms and motion generators. successful control methods will finally be tested and improved on the robot platform. the second position will focus on the mechanical design of the robot (cad), including the hydraulic actuation system, adjustable stiffness mechanisms and eventually compact power systems. 

 

applicants for this area are should ideally possess a strong background in electronic/electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, or a physical science.

theme 3.10: development of water hydraulic components and systems for robotics

tutors: dr yang yousheng

n. available positions: 1

 

water hydraulics, which uses water instead of oil as the power transmitting medium, is environmentally friendly, non-flammable, inexpensive, clean, readily available, and easily disposable. more importantly, when compared to oil hydraulics, water hydraulics has a quicker response and a higher efficiency. in addition, it is more stable (in terms of flow velocity and efficiency) over a wide range of operating temperatures due to water's higher bulk modulus, a lower viscosity and a higher specific heat capacity. all the above mentioned advantages make water hydraulics appealing in high performance actuation techniques such as robotics.however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, poor lubrication, has higher leakage and requires appropriate material and design. 

the aim of the phd project is to develop water hydraulic components and systems for robotic actuation. the position will focus on the development of compact, small size and light weight water hydraulic components, including modelling, simulation, prototyping, experiment.

the candidate should ideally have a masters degree in mechanical engineering or related areas. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills. ideal candidates should have experience in fluid dynamics, and have programming skills in c or fortran. experience with proe, fluent, adams or amesim would be a benefit but are not essential.

theme 3.11: autonomous robotic propulsion 

tutors: dr emanuele guglielmino 

n. available positions: 1

 

the aim of the project is the design of an efficient and compact propulsion system (using conventional thermal engines, fuel cells, stirling engines, electrical motors, hybrid solutions etc) in autonomous robots. the work will focus on the integration of conventional and non-conventional engines and motors into autonomous robots (in particular on a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot, hy-q) using  a systems engineering approach.

the candidate should ideally have a good first degree in mechanical engineering (with major in thermal engines) or an equivalent physical science.

theme 3.12 actuation and power systems

tutor: prof darwin caldwell

n. available positions: 1

actuation systems, power sources and storage of energy are vital and often overlooked features of robotic and humanoid systems. researchers working in this area will explore novel actuation technology (braided pneumatic muscle actuators, polymeric actuators, shape memory alloys, compliant and hybrid actuation) and the enhancement of current technologies (hydraulics, er fluids, mr fluids, piezoelectric motors).  the actuation systems will be incorporated into a new generation of robots having the structure, characteristics and behaviour of humans, hominoids, and/or animals. 

 

previous experience with these technologies would be an advantage but the programme is open to researchers with a strong background in any physical science or engineering discipline.

theme 3.13: integrated microfluidic devices for biomanipulations

tutor: dr leonardo mattos

no. of available positions: 1

 

the development of sciences such as genetics, drug discovery and environmental health has been greatly increasing the demand for biomanipulation procedures.  transgenic and gene-target animals, for example, are commonly used as models of a wide range of serious human afflictions, including diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, alzheimer's disease, and cancer.  as a consequence, the demand for efficient and consistent biomanipulations has also increased.  these are very delicate operations, which are traditionally performed on clear petri dishes placed under a powerful microscope and using mechanical micromanipulators.  the equipment employed is bulky and expensive, and the training of operators is often a very long process - up to one year for operations such as embryo microinjections.  in addition, the success rate and consistency of biomanipulation procedures are highly affected by the experience and mood of the operators.  therefore, automation is highly desired in this area.

the development of novel microfluidic systems has a great potential to simplify and miniaturize the biomanipulation equipment, improve task consistency, and create a more suitable system for computer controlled operations.  hence, the topic of research will involve the identification of microfabrication techniques suitable for the construction of microfluidic devices for cell work under (or off) the microscope; the design and construction of devices for the different biomanipulation tasks; and the development of computer interfaces and controllers for the novel devices.  the ideal candidate should have a background on engineering or computer science and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.  experience in robotics, biological systems or real-time systems are additional bonuses.

theme 3.14: computer vision for automated biomanipulations

tutor: dr leonardo mattos

no. of available positions: 1

 

the advent of high-precision motorized micromanipulators and microscopes incorporating video cameras has enabled the creation of effective teleoperated biomanipulation systems.  the use of such systems has demonstrated increased consistency and efficiency of the operations, and also a significant reduction in the training time of new operators.  however, these teleoperated systems still require direct control by a well-trained operator, so the biomanipulations are still susceptible to operator errors and to the inconsistency of manual operations.  in addition, many biomanipulation tasks are repetitive and time consuming, so the operators spend valuable working hours performing tedious procedures.  consequently, the automation of biomanipulation procedures is highly desired. 

a key element for the development of a successful automated biomanipulation system is a fast and robust vision system.  such system should be able to localize and track the objects involved in the tasks, and to provide such information as feedback to automatic controllers.  therefore, the topic of research will involve the design of accurate, robust, and fast vision algorithms for biomanipulation applications. the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.

<mailto:leonardo.demattos at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.15: intelligent controllers for biomanipulation automation

tutor: dr leonardo mattos

no. of available positions: 1

 

the automation of biomanipulation procedures is expected to facilitate and speedup biomedical research by improving the consistency and efficiency of the operations, and by reducing contaminations.  furthermore, automation is expected to free laboratory personnel from repetitive and tedious tasks; reduce training costs associated with the operations; and reduce the dependency of biomanipulation facilities on individual operators.  however, the success of an automated system is always linked to an efficient and robust control system, which is not easily implemented for biomanipulation tasks because they are often very complex and delicate.  the development of rule-based automatic controllers requires extensive process analysis and, even then, may be susceptible to exception errors in complex tasks.

the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques may offer an alternative for the development of robust and flexible control systems for biomanipulations.  an interesting approach to this problem would be, for example, the development of an intelligent system that can learn tasks by observing expert operators.  another approach could be the development of simulators from which intelligent controllers can be developed.  therefore, the topic of research will involve the investigation of online or offline learning methods applied to the generation of automatic system controllers.  experimentation will be performed in collaboration with the iit's neuroscience department, and will be based on the available fully teleoperated biomanipulation system.  the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.  experience in a.i. and robotics are additional bonuses.

idsia was the smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the  
1997 ""x-lab survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth  
place in the category ""computer science - biologically inspired"".  
idsia's most important work was done after 1997 though. it is small  
but visible, competitive, and influential. its highly cited ant colony  
optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records and are now  
widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc (today entire  
conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the origin  
of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial  
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers (previous  
work on general ai was dominated by heuristics). idsia's artificial  
recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous unlearnable  
sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, artificial  
evolution and other methods. research topics also include complexity  
and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and information  
theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia's results were reviewed  
not only in science journals such as nature, science, scientific  
american, but also in numerous popular press articles in time, the ny  
times, der spiegel, etc. many tv shows on tech & science helped to  
popularize idsia's achievements.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of  
special relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated  
with 105 nobel laureates, and boasts far more nobel prizes per capita  
than any other nation. it also has the world's highest number of  
publications per capita, the highest number of patents per capita, the  
highest citation impact factor, the most cited single-author paper,  
etc, etc. switzerland also got the highest ranking in the list of  
happiest countries."

abstracts of the research topics proposed 

stream 1: humanoid robotics and cognition

theme 3.1: composite materials design for biocompatible robotic structural
elements.
tutors: dr. davide ricci, dr. alberto barone
this ph.d. thesis proposal originates from the collaboration of the iit
robotic, brain and cognitive sciences department with the iit
nanobiotechnology facility.
an essential task that needs to be addressed in the realization of robotic
prosthetic devices is the coupling of structural elements of artificial
limbs with bone tissue. many pre-clinical and also clinical reports
demonstrate that poor scaffold design and inadequate tissue culture
conditions are currently the major problems in bone tissue engineering that
may prevent its successful applications. to overcome these limitations,
novel structural biomaterials and better bio-reactor processes are needed,
capable of sustaining and guiding bone tissue precursors generation and
differentation. within this project, we will pursue the integration of
bio-hybrid synthetic techniques, nanotechnologies and advanced material
processing technologies to obtain three-dimensional scaffolds able to guide
and control tissue growth, differentiation and proliferation.
requirements: potential candidates should have basic background in one or
more of the following fields: materials science, polymer science,
biomechanics
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
davide.ricci at iit.it alberto.barone at iit.it


theme 3.2: finite element analysis and cad design of robotic components made
from variable stiffness composite materials
tutor: prof. giorgio metta
a traditional robot is made of mechanical parts that are assembled with
screws, bearings, levers, gears and other components to obtain the desired
functionality. an emerging trend in robot design relies instead on deriving
the required functionality directly from the materials properties. two
approaches can be envisaged: either by appropriately combining functional
materials with different properties via methods similar to the ""shape
deposition manufacturing"" (kutkosky et al. 1989) or by locally modifying a
composite material properties changing the density and nature of fillers. to
this end, cad and fe simulations are essential tools to choose the
appropriate materials and shape for the robot components. 
the goal of this project is the design of a robot hand for the icub
(http://www.robotcub.org) that includes variable stiffness mechanics,
sensorization (proprioceptive and tactile), wiring and tendon driven
actuation. appropriate controllers are also required to match and exploit
natural compliance but also to compensate for e.g. backlash. the reference
task will be manipulation.
the ideal candidate would have a background in mechanical engineering or
related disciplines, and in particular, skills in finite element
analysis/modelling, robotics, and more in general in the use of polymers in
mechanical design. on the other hand, iit will provide a fully equipped
machine shop with cnc and rapid prototyping machines both on polymers and
metal. the successful candidate is expected to work in a team and contribute
substantially to the design of a future release of the icub.
requirements: physics, mechanical or material engineering,
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it 

theme 3.3: learning body dynamics in humans and robots
tutor: dr. francesco nori
humans exhibit a broad repertoire of motor capabilities far beyond the
capabilities of modern robots. remarkably, there is strong evidence that
these capabilities are strongly linked to human adaptability to novel
dynamical contexts (j.r. lackner and p. dizio, 1994) (r. shadmehr and f.a.
mussa-ivaldi, 1994) (j. konczak et al., 1995). related neurophysiological
experiments suggest that this adaptability can be the result of a modular
organization of the central nervous system which forms forward and inverse
dynamical representations by means of multiple modules. 
the final goal of this research project will be to enhance a “state of the
art” humanoid robot (http://www.icub.org) with a “beyond the state of the
art” adaptive dynamical controller. the project should focus on the robot
ability to develop, learn and adapt a multisensory representation of its own
body dynamics and of the surrounding dynamical environment, possibly
exploiting the generalization potentialities behind a modular
representation. 
requirements: engineering background, confidence with dynamical system
analysis, (optional) machine learning, adaptive control 
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
francesco.nori at iit.it and giorgio.metta at iit.it 


theme 3.4: manipulation and learning in humanoid robots
tutor: dr. lorenzo natale
object manipulation is a key ability for robots. however current robots are
very poor at manipulating objects in dynamical or unmodeled environments.
unfortunately this situation is quite common in practical scenarios and
seriously hampers the possibility to employ robots outside industries or
research laboratories. 
in this project we will study the role of haptic information (touch,
proprioception and force) for manipulation. the goals of the project are
two: i) to implement control strategies for grasping and manipulating
objects and ii) to investigate how to use the sensory information
originating from the manipulation of objects (haptic but also visual or
auditory) for learning about objects and the environment. 
the project will be carried out working on the robot icub. the icub is a 53
degree of freedom humanoid robot equipped with dexterous arms and hands
(respectively 7 and 9 degrees of freedom). we have recently added torque
sensing on the arm and realized tactile sensors to be mounted on the hand
and the arm of the robot. 
we seek candidates with a strong background in computer science and
engineering that are interested in studying perception and learning in
artificial systems. backgrounds of electronics and mechanics are not
required, but the candidates should have a strong motivation to work on
robotic systems.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
lorenzo.natale at iit.it and giorgio.metta at iit.it


theme 3.5: reaching and moving in the peripersonal space for a  humanoid
robots
tutor: prof. giorgio metta, prof. luciano fadiga
tantalizing evidence from neuroscience is showing that the control of
reaching in humans and animals is correlated with the activation of several
neural pathways, where touch, proprioception, and vision are intertwined
with motor information in a multisensory representation of the space around
the body (fogassi, gallese, di pellegrino, fadiga, et al. 1992).
the goal of this phd program is to model these multiple neural pathways in
the form of a working controller for a humanoid robot. the robot in question
is the icub which is equipped with vision, proprioception and soon with a
distributed sensorized skin. we will study how this multisensory
representation can be acquired through learning and development during the
interaction of the robot with the environment. we will formulate models that
are in agreement with neuroscience (rizzolatti, fadiga, fogassi, gallese,
1997).
we are seeking candidates with a strong motivation to implement biologically
sound models in a humanoid robot, with a background in engineering or
related disciplines, programming skills, and some machine learning or
computer vision experience. the successful candidate is expected to work in
a team and integrate with the existing development tools and methods.
requirements: engineering or computer science background, some experience in
one of more of the following disciplines: machine learning, computer vision,
control systems, neuroscience.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it or luciano.fadiga at iit.it
 

theme 3.6: neuromorphic sensors for humanoid robots
tutor: dr. chiara bartolozzi
biological sensory systems outperform conventional digital systems in almost
all aspects of perception tasks, where the system must process noisy and
ambiguous stimuli to produce appropriate behavioral responses. the goal of
this project is to introduce in the field of robotic vision the principles
of biological sensory systems design. specifically we aim at combining the
design of novel data-driven biologically inspired sensory devices with the
development of new asynchronous event-driven computational paradigms, with
structure and morphology that are matched to the requirements of the robots
body and its application domain. the candidate shall work on testing of
existing asynchronous vision sensors and on the design of new sensors, using
analog real-time low-power vlsi neuromorphic circuits. the candidate will
participate in the whole project development by also interacting with
researchers developing supporting data-driven asynchronous computational
paradigms for machine-vision methodologies, and participating to the testing
of the developed vision system performance on advanced humanoid robotic
platforms. 
requirements: applicants should have a strong interest in bio-inspired
hardware engineering, fundamental notions of microelectronics and background
in neuroscience.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
chiara.bartolozzi at iit.it


theme 3.7: event-driven vision for robot control
tutor: drs. giorgio metta, chiara bartolozzi, r. benosman
the goal of this project is to develop asynchronous event-driven
computational paradigms for designing visual systems based on data-driven
biologically inspired sensory devices providing spike-based outputs. such
sensors respond with spiking events to relative variations of contrast in
their field of view. this approach reduces redundancies and produces a
sparse image coding. the generated data are spatiotemporal volumes which
size and information depend only on the dynamic content of observed scenes.
the real-time asynchronous output nature of the sensors ensures precise
timing information and low latency, yet requiring a much lower bandwidth
used by frame-based image sensors of equivalent time resolution. the high
temporal precision is crucial for real-time interaction with the environment
and is especially suitable for tasks requiring fast evaluation of dynamic
scenes, involving real time interaction with the environment. at the same
time, the nature of the sensor's output requires a radically new framework
of data-driven asynchronous computational paradigms for vision. the
candidate will work on the development of event-driven algorithms for the
visual system of a humanoid robot, the icub, starting from stereo vision and
binocular vergence control to end up with recognition and control of the
robot’s own hands dynamics, with the final goal of objects dexterous
manipulation.
requirements: ideal candidates have a strong background in robotics or
computer vision; candidates with background in neuroscience are also
welcome. they should have potential for excellent research and the
capability to collaborate within an interdisciplinary research group with
people from all these disciplines. they should be highly motivated to use
robotics for tackling fundamental issues in bio inspired perception.

phd fellowships - application deadline september 25th, 2009 




the advanced robotics department of the italian institute of technology (iit) has new phd positions available within the ""biomedical robotics"" area.  the positions are for a 3-year doctoral program in: (1) biomanipulations; and (2) minimally invasive laser surgeries. short descriptions of the proposed research themes are presented below. 
 
(1) theme 1.7: novel sensors and controllers for biomanipulation automation
tutors: dr. leonardo mattos, dr. darwin caldwell
the progress of sciences such as genetics, drug discovery and associated biomedical areas has greatly increased the demand for consistent and efficient biomanipulation procedures. transgenic and gene-target animals, for example, are commonly used as models of a wide range of serious human afflictions, including diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, alzheimer's disease, and cancer. however, the processes involved in the creation of these animal models suffer from the inconsistencies of direct manual operations. the development of novel microfluidic systems has a great potential to simplify and miniaturize the biomanipulation equipment, improve task consistency, and create a more suitable system for computer controlled operations. hence, this research will focus on the design and construction of new microfluidic devices for biomanipulations under (or off) the microscope; the development of computer interfaces and controllers for the novel devices; and on the development of adaptive and precise controllers able to perform complex operations on delicate biological structures.  this research will be conducted in close collaboration with biologists and neuroscience researchers within the iit's neuroscience department.
requirements: the ideal candidate should have an engineering background and be interested in hardware/software integration for biological applications. experience in robotics, microfluidics and/or biomedical systems are additional bonuses.
 
(2) theme 1.8: novel actuators and controllers for minimally invasive laser surgeries
tutors: dr. leonardo mattos, dr. darwin caldwell
this research will focus on overcoming the most significant limitations of current surgical laser procedures: namely poor laser aiming control, poor system ergonomics and the requirement for extensive training of surgeons. the goal will be to design and develop novel motorized laser micromanipulators and controllers to increased precision and safety of the surgeries. the initial aim will be to improve phonomicrosurgeries, so the work will benefit from current collaborations with ent surgeons at san martino's hospital. nonetheless, other surgical applications are thought. 
requirements: the ideal candidates for this research theme should have an engineering background and strong interest in medical robotics. experience in mechanical design, hardware/software integration, and control systems are all bonuses.

doctoral school on ""life and humanoid technologies""
 
phd positions - application deadline: september 25th, 2009

phd positions are available in the following themes in the area of hydraulic actuation for robotic 
applications at the department of advanced robotics (http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics.html) of the 
italian institute of technology (iit) located in genoa.


magnetorheological technologies for robotics
 
magnetorheological (mr) fluids are a particular class of hydraulic oils that respond to an applied magnetic
field with a dramatic change in their rheological behaviour. they are used in a variety of applications, most
notoriously as controllable dampers in the suspensions of high performance cars. the main characteristic of
these fluids is their ability to reversibly change from free-flowing, linear viscous liquids, to semi-solids with the
yield strength swiftly and continuously controllable (milliseconds scale dynamics) when exposed to a
magnetic field.
since yield stress (and hence viscosity) of these fluids can be varied reversibly by controlling the field
strength, mr fluids are potentially an excellent means to dynamically interface mechanical and electrical
systems.
in robotics they can be used in three areas:
1. as controllable dampers to attenuate vibration
2. as spool-less valve in magnetorheologically-actuated robotic manipulators
3. to introduce compliance in robotic structures
the aim of the project is to investigate at least one of these aspects. the work will have both a simulation
and an experimental part and may include exchange periods abroad in an eu university.
technical skills : degree in mechanical/electrical/mechatronic engineering (60% hydraulics and magnetic
circuit design, 40% mechanics).
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it


development of water hydraulic components and systems for robotics

water hydraulics, which uses water instead of oil as the power transmitting medium, is environmentally
friendly, non-flammable, inexpensive, readily available, and easily disposable. more importantly, when
compared to oil hydraulics, water hydraulics has a quicker response and a higher efficiency. in addition, it is
more stable (in terms of flow velocity and efficiency) over a wide range of operating temperatures due to
water's higher bulk modulus, a lower viscosity and a higher specific heat capacity. all the above mentioned
advantages make water hydraulics appealing in high performance actuation techniques such as robotics.
however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, poor lubrication, has higher leakage and
requires appropriate materials and design.
the aim of the phd project is to develop water hydraulic components and systems for robotics actuation.
the position will focus on the development of compact, small size and light weight water hydraulic
components (valves and actuators). the research encompasses modelling, simulation, prototyping 
and experimental testing.
technical skills: degree in mechanical/mechatronic/electrical engineering with major in fluid power. 
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: yousheng.yang at iit.it


development and control of soft and continuum robot manipulator inspired by the
octopus arm

the project focuses on novel design principles and technologies for a new generation of high dexterity 
softbodied robots inspired by the morphology and behaviour of the octopus. the candidate will work within an
international environment (http://www.octopusproject.eu/) on the development and control of the actuation
modules for the mechatronic robotic octopus arm. during the first period of the project the materials and
actuation techniques to be used for the development of the hyper redundant arm will be identified. for the
realization of the octopus arm both novel and revisited conventional actuation technology will be explored
e.g. magnetorheological actuators, hydraulic/pneumatic actuators, micro fluidic actuators, shape memory alloys, 
compliant and hybrid actuation and piezoelectric motors.
following the development of the arm different control strategies will also be identified and evaluated which
will allow the soft continuum arm to execute tasks and motion profiles similar to those observed in the
octopus, e.g. reaching, grasping and fetching.
requirements: applicants ideally should have a background in electronic/mechanical engineering or
computer science. the candidates should have good competence and be strongly motivated to work with
robot kinematics analysis and control within an international multidisciplinary environment. experience in
robot kinematics analysis and control would be a benefit (mechanical design 30%, kinematics/control 70%).

----

 

theme 1.1: development of a bi-manual semi-exoskeleton system for
enhanced teleoperation and virtual immersion

 

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis

the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of training or teleoperation
procedures as these actions require the user to extensively engage his
hand and fingers. in the recent years the rapid improvements in hardware
and software to provide effective force/touch feedback has led to the
development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various
training simulators and teleoperation systems. in most of these
instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered
use are relatively poor. in addition these systems provide only point
contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where
hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of
varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. to be of
any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a
natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic
interface. the development of a multi degree of freedom haptic system
(based on semi-exoskeletal systems) with large working, volume, high
backdrivability and multimodal feedback capability will be the core of
this research. this interface will provide immersive haptic feedback
from a virtual environment or during teleoperation procedures involving
stimulation of proprioceptive and cutaneous nerves centres to provide
data on interaction force, shape, size, texture and contact pressure.

requirements: we are seeking for candidates with a background in
electronic/mechanical engineering or robotics. experience and
competencies in cad mechanical design and good knowledge of robot
kinematics analysis would be a benefit. (mechanical design 50%,
kinematics/optimisation 30%, control 20%)

 

 

theme 1.2. development and control of soft and continuum robot
manipulator inspired by the octopus arm

the project focuses on novel design principles and technologies for a
new generation of high dexterity soft bodied robots inspired by the
morphology and behaviour of the octopus. the candidate will work within
an international environment (http://www.octopusproject.eu/) on the
development and control of the actuation modules for the mechatronic

to execute tasks and motion profiles similar to those observed in the
octopus, e.g. reaching, grasping and fetching.

requirements: applicants ideally should have a background in
electronic/mechanical engineering or computer science. the candidates
should have good competence and be strongly motivated to work with robot
kinematics analysis and control. (mechanical design 30%,
kinematics/control 70%)  

 

 

theme 1.3. development of the next generation of humanoids: exploring
the mechatronic technological limits and new design philosophies

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderborght

 

although significant progress have been made during the last two decades
in the mechatronic development of humanoid robots there are still
significant barriers to be overcome before the body ware (structure,
actuation and sensing) of the humanoid systems approach the performance
of the human body. when compared with humans humanoids significantly
lack in performance and robustness when considering high impact
interactions with the environment either when they are self generated or
accidentally imposed, e.g. falling down. high impact interactions are
required for example during the execution of highly dynamic tasks, e.g.
running at speeds close to those that humans can achieve. these will
require the continues interaction of the robot body with the ground
generating at each cycle high collision forces which cannot be tolerated
by any existing humanoid system. this is because the design approach of
these systems is incompatible with those tasks. the existing humanoid
systems consist of rigid structures and are actuated by highly geared
stiff position servos which impose significant limitations both in the
velocities/torque profiles that can be achieved at the joint level and
in the capability of these systems to absorb the impacts. in addition
the lack of compliance does not allow these robots to make use of the
natural dynamics and storage of energy during the motion cycle. as a
result these robots have higher energy demands since more effort is
required by both the control system and the actuator. the aim of this
research is to improve the performance of the existing humanoid systems
on the aspects discussed above by exploring both the mechatronic
technological limits (structural materials, actuation) and new design
and control philosophies. the outcome of these efforts will be verified
though the development of a highly dynamic bipedal machine targeting to
achieve running speeds close to those achieved by humans while at the
same time demonstrating robustness and adequate tolerance to external
disturbances.

requirements: we are preferably seeking for candidates with a background
in electronic/mechanical engineering or robotics. experience and
competencies in cad mechanical design and good knowledge of robot
kinematics/dynamics would be a benefit. (mechanical design 70%,
dynamics/control 30%)

 

 

theme 1.4 development of the new lower body of the humanoid robot icub
using compliant

actuators

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderborght

 

the humanoid child robot icub has been constructed within the european
consortium robotcub. the legs have 12dof and are powered by electrical
motors and harmonic drives making the joints stiff. however, for energy
efficient and natural walking, humans have compliant joints. at iit
different adaptable compliant actuators and their control architectures
are under development. goal of this phd is to redesign the lower body of
icub to incorporate these compliant actuators. in the initial phase of
the project simulation studies on the lower body will be used to
identify the optimum position of the compliant elements across the leg
kinematic chain. the compliant actuation sources will be designed and
realized using electromechanical arrangements of mechanical elastic
elements and motorized based units. the mechanical characteristics of
these newly developed actuators will be determined through simulation
analysis of the humanoid platform as well as from human biomechanical
data. from these studies parameters such as joint stiffness range,
energy storage capacity and actuator power will be determined and will
be used for the fine tuning of the actuator electromechanical assembly.
following this the compliance solutions developed will be mechanically
shaped to make them compatible with the mechanical morphology of the
icub child humanoid platform. the incorporation of the passive compliant
actuation and the active compliance control into the existing icub lower
body will effectively convert this robot into the first humanoid
platform which will exhibit a fully compliant lower body. following the
mechatronic developments a second objective of the project will be to
develop new control strategies to make benefit of the intrinsic
compliance in order to improve the energy efficiency and the
adaptability of the robot to terrain variations.

requirements: this project is open to two different phd candidates: one
with more interest in control/software aspects and the other in

project details
===========
project number: fp7 strep project number 248497
project title: trident: marine robots and dexterous manipulation for  
enabling autonomous underwater multipurpose intervention missions.

abstract
======= 
trident proposes a new methodology for multipurpose underwater  
intervention tasks with diverse potential applications like underwater  
archaeology, oceanography and offshore industries, going beyond  
present-day methods typically based on manned and / or purpose – built  
systems.
a team of two cooperative heterogeneous robots with complementary  
skills,  an autonomous surface craft (asc) and an intervention  
autonomous underwater vehicle (i-auv) endowed with a dexterous  
manipulator, will be used to perform underwater manipulation tasks.  
the proposed methodology is based on two steps.
during the first step, the i-auv is deployed from the asc to perform a  
cooperative path following survey, where it gathers optical/acoustic  
data from the seafloor whilst the asc provides geo-referenced  
navigation data as well as communication with the end user. during  
this phase of the mission the i-auv will be doing accurate path  
following and terrain tracking, to maximize bottom coverage and data  
quality. the motion of the asc will be coordinated with that of the i- 
auv to achieve precise usbl (ultra short base line) positioning and  
reliable acoustic communications. after the survey, the i-auv docks  
with the asc and sends the data back to a ground station where a map  
is set up and a target object is identified by the end user.  at the  
second step, the asc navigates towards a waypoint near the  
intervention area where the i-auv is launched to search for the  
object. when the object (i.e. the target of the intervention) has been  
found, the i-auv switches to free floating navigation mode. the  
manipulation of the object takes place through a dexterous hand  
attached to a redundant robot arm and assisted with proper perception.  
particular emphasis will be put on the research of the vehicles  
intelligent control architecture to provide the embedded knowledge  
representation framework and the high-level reasoning agents required  
to enable a high degree of autonomy and on-board decision making of  
the platform. the new methodology will allow the user to specify an  
intervention task, among a set of predefined ones, to be undertaken  
with regards to a particular target object selected by the end user by  
means of the map previously built. hence the intervention task is seen  
as a semi-automatic process where the target is manually selected but  
then it is automatically recognized and manipulated by the robot in a  
complete autonomous way.
the trident project brings together research skills specific to marine  
environments in navigation and mapping for underwater robotics, multi- 
sensory perception and a range of control techniques relating to  
intelligent control architectures, vehicle-manipulator systems and  
dexterous manipulation.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for auv  
navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to merge  
conventional dvl-fog navigation techniques with the recent results in  
sonar based scan matching in the context of the simultaneous  
localization and mapping techniques in order to setup a consistent and  
accurate elevation map of the seafloor. because sonar can see far  
away, it will be of interest to study how to deal with range scans  
gathered a different altitudes having then a different scale factor.  
hierarchical map structures able to accommodate these measurements  
will be studied.

vacancy 2: autonomous surface craft (asc) – autonomous underwater  
vehicle (auv) cooperative navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to use  
cooperative navigation techniques to accurately localize one or more  
auvs with the help of a dgps-equipped autonomous surface craft (or  
drifting buoy) being all the vehicles connected by means of low cost,  
low bandwidth acoustic modems. first the scenario of using an usbl in  
a direct configuration (transceiver mounted on the ship) will be  
explored and a solution explicitly taking into account the time delays  
due to the signal transmission will be proposed. then the sensorial  
requirements will be relaxed exploring the possibility of localizing  
the auv with the only help of range measurements (received for free  
with the acoustic data packets) arriving asynchronously from known  
positions (the surface craft pose). a dvl-mru equipped auv will be  
first considered, removing then the requirement of using a dvl.

vacancy 3: intelligent control architecture.
=================================
this vacancy is related with work package 3, which is responsible for  
providing the embedded knowledge representation framework and the high- 
level reasoning agents required to enable autonomy and on-board  
decision making of the platform. autonomous capabilities for  
intervention missions require heterogeneous embedded agents working in  
a dynamic operational field with hard and unpredictable environmental  
conditions. embedded agents specialise in different disciplines  
providing different capabilities or services to the overall system,  
i.e. navigation, mapping, vision, etc. this position will be related  
with the design and implementation of a path-planning agent. the main  
goal is to develop new algorithms for adaptive waypoint-based  
trajectory planning including path following, terrain following and  
obstacle avoidance. as a secondary goal, the work will also contribute  
in the design of an adaptive goal-based mission planning agent.

requirements:
===========
academic: excellent academic grades. knowledge in robotics, video/ 
sonar image processing. previous experience in navigation, mapping,  
slam techniques and/or control architectures will be appreciated. a  
master degree in the related areas will be valuable but not imperative.

nationality requirements: european citizen, or european residence  
permission.
contract type:  phd. student grant.
position:  phd. student
number of positions: 3
start date: february 2010/june 2010 (approx)
duration in months: 36/48

our project
-------------------
""efficient 3d completeness inspection"":
one important application of machine vision is quality control and in particular checking the completeness (presence/absence of parts, correct type, position, orientation, ...) of assemblies.
existing systems usually use standard monochrome or color cameras which produce a 2d  image. these images lack the information of depth and therefore it is difficult to
deal with non-rigid objects (hoses, cables) or low contrast between background and
parts. finally, they do not provide, often, an optimal view on each single part of the assembly.
this project aims at developing efficient 3d completeness inspection methods that
exploit two different innovative technologies. the first one is based on calculating arbitrary views of an object given a small number of images of this object, the second one aims at
combining 3d shape data obtained with laser range scanners with color and texture information. both technologies to be developed will cover the full chain from data acquisition via pre-processing to the final decision-making. the projects aims at developing a cost-effective technology, that will need standard computing hardware platforms.
3d completeness inspection is a technological gap in the machine vision market. the project is a collaboration between 3 smes and 3 research centers.

44,2010,"phd openings in machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction at the department of advanced robotics, italian institute of technology","the department of advanced robotics (http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics) at the italian institute of technology iit (an english language institute) located in genoa has a number of phd openings within the research areas of machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (starting in january 2011). please see below the list of the available themes.

--------
theme 2.7: incremental learning for compliant robots through the superposition of basis force fields

the aim of this phd proposal is to study incremental learning techniques applied to compliant robots. the advantage of moving from offline to online learning is twofold. compared to stiff robots, compliant robots allow users to get close to the robot, sharing not only the same environment but also the same tasks. the development of compliant robots facilitates the demonstration of new skills by using kinesthetic teaching (e.g., by using gravity compensation to move the robot as if it had no weight). when working in collaboration with robots, this type of interaction increase the quantity of data collected by the robots, and it becomes important to consider demonstration and reproduction as an interlaced process where the robot gradually refines its skill.

models based on a superposition of basis force fields have interesting characteristics for online learning, since most of the computation can be performed in parallel (each basis force field can be refined independently). exploiting the parallel computation power of graphics processing unit (gpu) for machine learning purpose is a recent but rapidly growing trend of research that could provide robots with cheap and portable parallel processing capabilities. another route is to consider learning as both a continuous and disruptive adaptation process. incremental learning techniques consist most of the time of progressive and continuous adjustments that allow the system to handle perturbations and slowly varying environments and adaptation to the robot's capabilities. however, as their biological counterparts, such systems would also occasionally benefit from disruptive adaptation mechanisms. cubs can optimize their crawling skills until their legs are strong enough to explore a completely different way of moving on two legs. it is proposed to study robot learning strategies allowing to acquire and refine skills through such a combination of imitation, exploration, evaluation of performance and practice.

for further details, please contact: sylvain.calinon at iit.it

--------
theme 2.8: from trajectory learning to force skills acquisition in compliant robotic arms

kinesthetic teaching offers a user-friendly and intuitive method to teach robots new skills. compliant robots offer new perspectives in this direction, where torque feedback can be used to let the user move the robot as if it had no weight, and as if no motors were in its articulations. through gravity compensation actuation, the user can concentrate on the task to demonstrate by grasping and re-grasping the robot in ways that are natural and efficient for him/her to execute the task. this proposal aims at extending the range of skills that a robot can learn by moving the representation of the task constraints to the force domain. it is first proposed to explore how robot learning capabilities can be improved through the use of both torque information at the level of the joints and force sensing at the level of the end-effector. it is then suggested to explore the simultaneous consideration of multiple constraints in the force domain (e.g. by considering multiple contact points), which would offer new perspectives in physical human-robot interaction.

for further details, please contact: sylvain.calinon at iit.it

--------
theme 2.9: safe human-robot interaction

traditional and new markets ranging from the industrial field to the service robotics, both for professional and domestic applications show an increasing desire for innovative robots able to collaborate with humans. one of the current challenges in robotics is therefore to improve safety in human-robot interaction. it is well known that collaborative tasks need to be performed in a flexible manner, where humans work side-by side with robots sharing workspace and objects. the risk assessment used for industrial applications guarantees safety around the robot by drawing a no go area where motion of the robot is halted if a human intrusion is detected. this approach, however, is far too restrictive for tasks where humans are required to closely interact with robots. as a consequence, considerable research is conducted, both at the hardware and software level to decrease the risk while improving the safety in human-robot interaction. at the hardware level, compliant actuators have been proposed as a safer approach for driving robots which have to interact with humans. using compliant actuators it is possible to reduce the forces of an impact between a robot and a human, in the cases of an unexpected collision. within the long-term project to develop a compliant humanoid robot (amarsi, european project), one open phd position is available. the aim of this project is to develop a control strategy for a multi-dof compliant robotic system along with the analysis of the optimal stiffness and the input trajectory profiles for minimizing energy consumption. at the software level, control strategies for adjusting the robot's behavior on the basis of the detected level of hazard in human robot interaction are required. the aim of the project is to first define a risk indicator on the basis of the safety restrictions (user or robot side) depending on the task to accomplish. this is necessary to continuously let the robot be aware of the environmental changes with respect to its internal state. the project will investigate how to construct the risk indicator and which are the parameters to take into account for describing changing safety constraints for several different tasks. task redundancy and user intention will mainly be considered for this purpose. then a control strategy will be implemented to accomplish the required tasks on the basis of the current level of risk. the project includes the use of the kuka lwr and/or barrett wam robotic arm.

the candidates should have a background in engineering, mathematics or physical sciences (control theory, system modeling) and computer science. required technical skills:  matlab, c/c++.

-power transmission systems for autonomous robots

tutors: david branson, dr emanuele guglielmino, dr claudio semini and industry supervisor

n. of available positions: 1

the ability of a robot to operate autonomously in any environment is dependent upon its capacity to provide the necessary power. the design and testing of effective portable power supplies has therefore become increasingly important. current robot designs show significant limitations in the duration, output, noise, weight, and environmental friendliness. what is needed is a powertrain system that addresses the need for adequate power output while maintaining a low weight and compact profile.

a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot (called hyq) platform has been developed at iit and provides the ideal working platform for the development and testing of such devices. the robot is able to perform highly dynamic tasks such as jumping, running and rough-terrain walking (http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hydraulically-actuated-quadruped-hyq.html). the aim of the project is to develop a compact and light weight power transmission system for the hyq robot to enhance power-autonomy. this will include investigating the energy storage medium (e.g. hydrogen gas, gasoline, h202, propane, etc.), electrical and hydraulic power supply systems and components. the project will also look at optimizing power transmission efficiency, reducing noise output, and the need to consider environmental and health implications.

work will involve design, modeling, simulation, prototyping and experimental work on a team based project at iit and with industrial partners. the candidate should ideally have a top class master's degree in mechanical engineering or mechatronics or similar. experience with power transmission systems would be a benefit but is not essential. the candidates must also have good writing and communication skills (60% mechanical design, 20% hydraulics, 20% software).

for further details concerning the research project, please contact: david.branson at iit.it<mailto:david.branson at iit.it> or emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it<mailto:emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it> or claudio.semini at iit.it<mailto:claudio.semini at iit.it>





-water hydraulic technology for robotics

tutors: dr emanuele guglielmino, dr david branson

number of available positions: 1

there is an increasing trend in hydraulic power transmission to replace petroleum-based fluids with water in an effort to reduce dependence on petroleum products. water is more environmentally friendly, easier to dispose of. however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, its lubrication is poorer, and internal leakage of the components is higher. hence research into appropriate component selection and system design is necessary to ensure proper application.

this project will look at the introduction of a water based fluid medium to achieve tasks such as walking, trotting, jumping, and rough-terrain walking on the hyq quadruped hydraulically-actuated robotic platform developed at iit. the project will be initially based on a system approach using off-the-shelf components to eliminate the need for component design at the initial stage.

the outcome of the project will be first a working leg using servovalve and digital hydraulic technology, and in the long term a full version of hyq using water hydraulics. in particular research to improve powertrain efficiency through the use of digital hydraulics will be carried out. the project will involve some control, simulation work and mechanical system design to integrate hydraulic components into the robotic structure.

the candidate should ideally have a top class master's degree (or similar) in mechanical engineering, mechatronics or a related domain. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills. ideal candidates should have experience in fluid dynamics, and have programming skills in c. experience with proe, and/or amesim would be a benefit but is not essential.

general information
-----------------------------------------------
a phd studentship is available in swarm robotics at the iridia-code, the artificial intelligence lab of the  université libre de bruxelles, belgium. 
swarm robotics is inspired by the observation of social insects (e.g. ants, termites, wasps and bees) which stand as fascinating examples of how collectively intelligent systems can be generated from a large number of simple individuals. as in their natural counterpart, the robots used in swarm robotics are relatively simple, with local and limited sensing and communication abilities. it is a natural consequence of these individual characteristics that the overall systems are robust against failures of individuals and scalable with group size. the student will work within a scenario in which robots are given a task whose solution requires strict cooperation, studying how a swarm robotics system can adapt to different tasks, varying environmental conditions, varying numbers and types of robots, and to different levels of malfunctioning of the robots.

the student we are looking for should possess a degree that allows to embark in a doctoral program (doctoral student positions). the area of  competence should be in at least one of the following disciplines:  computer science, computational intelligence, electrical engineering,  cognitive sciences. a master's degree with research experience is an asset. the student should have a strong background in computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other relevant computational disciplines. in particular, she/he should demonstrate very strong programming skills in one or more major computer languages. good communication and team-working skills are essential.


how to apply

the department of advanced robotics 
(http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics) at the italian institute of 
technology iit (an english language institute) placed in genoa has 2 phd 
positions within the hyq project. starting date is in january 2012.

we are seeking two highly motivated phd students to work on aspects of 
control and planning of dynamic locomotion through unstructured terrains 
(e.g. running through a forest, jumping, 'orienteering'). the students 
will be working in the framework of the hyq project. this hydraulic 
quadruped hyq is a unique research platform. it is a fully torque 
controlled electric/hydraulic quadruped robot equipped with inertial 
measurement units, laser range finders and stereo cameras.

http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hyq.html

legged robots have an advantage over wheeled robots in difficult and 
unstructured environments (e.g. outdoors, accident and disaster sites, 
etc). while this is the motivation behind much of the research in legged 
robotics the actual solutions are still largely confined to rather 
simple 'laboratory conditions'. the reasons for this are many, ranging 
from mechanical and design aspects through software to challenges in 
control and theoretical difficulties. in the department of advanced 
robotics at iit we are working on the technology to change this. we are 
developing legged robots and the required control, planning and 
navigation algorithms to enable fully autonomous, fast and reliable 
operation for in- and outdoor settings.

the exact research program will be determined both based on the 
background and interests of the students and the need of the project. 
possible research topics include but are not limited to: control of 
floating base articulated robots, kino-dynamic planning, probabilistic 
planning & control, force & impedance control, learning and adaptive 
control of legged robots, dynamic terrain and obstacle perception and 
modeling, path planning.

the ideal candidate has an excellent background in robotics, control 
engineering, dynamical systems or similar fields. excellent programming 
skills are a prerequisite. it is furthermore desired that the student 
has a practical flair and a desire to do experimental work. the work 
will require elements of theoretical work, software implementation and 
field tests. the ability to collaborate across and beyond disciplines is 
a key to success in this research program.

we are seeking one highly motivated phd student to work on the 
development of a medium sized dynamic quadruped robot. the students will 
be working in the framework of the hyq project. the hydraulic quadruped 
hyq is a unique research platform: it is a fully torque-controlled 
electric/hydraulic quadruped robot, ready for versatile locomotion. hyq 
is capable of performing both precise movements and strong and fast 
motions that are necessary for dynamic tasks such as jumping and running.
http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hyq.html
the hyq robot is powered by a combination of electric and hydraulic 
actuators. hydraulic cylinders are a crucial element of the robot design 
since they enable high joint speeds and torques and are robust against 
impact loads during running and jumping. hyq's current dimensions are 
comparable to the size of a goat or a small horse.

the goal of this phd proposal is the development and evaluation of a 
smaller sized version of the robot. the design of the new robot platform 
will be based on the experiences gained from hyq and through modelling 
and simulation. the phd student will evaluate different actuator 
technologies and construction materials, design and test prototype legs 
and finally build and experimentally evaluate the full quadruped robot.

requirements: the successful candidate is able to both work in a team 
and independently. he/she has a top degree in mechanical, mechatronic or 
electric engineering, preferably with practical experience in robot 
design. (60% mechanical design, 20% hydraulics, 20% software).

details of the call:

theme 2.1: social augmentation for robotic platforms using computer vision and machine learning

recent research in robotics is trying hard to push robots out of factories and research laboratories. effective operation in everyday environments requires not only sophisticated and robust perceptual systems but also the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues and human intentions. such capabilities are fundamental prerequisites to program the robot to react appropriately to humans and to bias the interpretation of the scene using nonverbal cues (gaze or body gestures).
the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social intentions. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot or his posture and intentions. conventional research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on applications in which the image patch of a whole person (or group of people) is visible without strong occlusions in. on the other hand, face-to-face interaction requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. this egocentric (first-person) computer vision is of certain importance and of foreseen widespread diffusion also for humans given the introduction of new compact and wearable devices (e.g. google project glass prototypes).

this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have computer programming skills.

the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

theme 2.2: haptic exploration for humanoid navigation with a compliant robot

tutor: nicolas perrin, francecsco nori, nikos tsagarakis, giorgio metta
n. of available positions: 1

humans are able to modify their usual strategy for locomotion in order to
move in a cluttered environment without any visual information. the goal of
this phd research program is to perform this difficult task with a compliant
humanoid robot. more precisely, we will study the problem of navigation in
an unknown environment with a ""blind"" humanoid robot. this may require
haptic exploration with the feet to find flat and stable surfaces, or arm
motions to check for the absence of obstacles through haptic exploration
including proprioceptive joint measurements or full body tactile skin
sensing, or on the contrary find safe contacts to increase balance. the
successful candidate will investigate various algorithms and multi-contact
planning strategies in order to solve this problem in complicated
environments. in a first phase, quasi-static motions might be considered,
but trying to maximize the robot speed will ultimately be an objective of
prime importance. because of their increased ability to absorb shocks, it is
expected that passively compliant robots can perform blind navigation faster
than other robots, and the successful candidate should try to demonstrate
this intuition. experiments will be made on the passively compliant
coman/icub platforms:

sole application of blind navigation.

theme 3.13: dynamic walking and running of compliant humanoid robots on rough terrain
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1 

the application of humanoids in the human environment requires the mobility of walking and running on the reconstructed terrain in contrast to a prepared and known lab environment. there are a plenty of existing methods, such as the zmp based pattern generation, which can provide dynamically feasible trajectories for walking and running on a flat ground. however, most of the methods are designed for the humanoid robots with stiff actuations. due to the high stiffness of the actuators, the capability of adapting the rough and uneven terrain is very limited. moreover, a more agile and dynamic movement requires a more compliant interaction with the environment in order to reduce the impacts. these essential demands can be solved by designing the smart mechanism that exploits the intrinsic compliance as the nature shows in biological land animals.

with the new compliant hardware and the task of walking on the rough terrain, there is a raising demand of a new control methodology that makes use of the physical compliance for smooth interaction and provides the feasible controllers to generate variety types of walking and running gaits. differ from the engineering approaches from which a lot of artificial constraints are unnatural imposed, such as the zmp method, the new research would investigate the results from the passive dynamic walkers and the nonlinearity of the step-to-step transitions. typically for humans, walking and running do not necessarily involve symmetric or periodic alternation of legs. the limit cycle approach investigates the cyclic gaits which demonstrate self-stability.  the proposed research topic will focus on the extraction of the fundamental principles of the limit cycle method previously applied on passive dynamic walkers (typically gravity powered walking). a number of methods for controlling the kinetic energy will be studied and further extend it to a more general principle for dynamic walking and running. the implementation and experimental validation will be finally conducted on the rough terrain. the research platform for testing the hypotheses is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

 
theme 3.14: stabilization and balance control of the compliant humanoid robots 
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1 

while operating in human environment, the humanoid robots permanently have the risk of colliding with unexpected objects and falling. to tackle the collisions and prevent a fall are crucial regarding the safety for both humans and robots. the stabilization of the proposed research will focus on the passivity based compliance control to attenuate the undesired oscillations and movements caused by impacts during the robots’ interaction with the environment, especially for the robots with physical compliant materials.

the balancing control will investigate different strategies to maintain the equilibrium. for small and moderate disturbances, the robot could balance without taking steps. however, since the capability of keeping balance is limited given a fixed size of the support area, the robot must exploit other strategies such as taking steps when the increasing disturbance is able to topple the robot. the proposed research will develop the balance control using both the simplified model and a full body dynamics model. the feedbacks for the balance control will require the sensor fusion of a number of different signals, such as the linkage positions (proprioception), the reaction forces acting in feet (haptics) and the inertial measurement (inner ears). the algorithms are expected to be tolerant to parameter variations and robust to different types of disturbances (external pushes and terrain surface variations). the research platform for testing the algorithms is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in:
1. rigid body dynamics, mechanics;
2. classical and modern control theory;
3. programming skills (matlab, c/c++);
4. good in english communication.

candidates are encouraged to send their cv prior to application.

detailed list of phd themes:

theme 3.9: new design and implementation principles for variable impedance actuation
the department of advances robotics is currently one of the leading research institutes working in the development and integration of compliant actuators in robots.  series compliant actuators are increasingly being considered for actuation of a new generation of human centred robots. in human robot interaction and friendly robotics the introduction of springs in series with the electric motors provides to the robots passive compliance which is an extra measure of safety when interacting with humans. in robots operating in unstructured environments, such as humanoids, series elastic actuation provides instantaneous compliance to impulse loads protecting the mechanics and assisting the controller to absorb the impact. depending on the mechanical design and control method used, elastic components in the actuation may also allow for energy storage and recovery during gait or in high power actions such as throwing, kicking and jumping.  however, the introduction of springs in the robot's actuation alters the dynamics of the system significantly compared to that of a rigid robot and makes control more prone to oscillation. for this reason we also consider the addition of mechanical damping in parallel to the elastic components.
the goal of this phd will be the development of new design principles of variable impedance actuation with actively controlled variable mechanical compliance and damping/braking.  this research will investigate actuator power, stiffness and damping specifications for a range of foreseen applications which will be followed by a compete modeling of the system in terms of physical and electromechanical components. the developed actuators will be considered for anthropomorphic arms and for walking robots. research in the utility and control of the actuator will extend also toward energy storage and recovery in high power bursts such as throwing, kicking and jumping of anthropomorphic robots.

we are seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering, physical sciences or robotics. experience and competencies in cad mechanical design, modeling of electromechanical systems and knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>  and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>


theme 3.17:tactile sensing for robotic arms and dextrous hands
tactile sensing is an important area in haptics, teleoperation and robotic dexterous manipulation. manipulation of objects through dextrous multi degree of freedom robotic hands can only be efficiently performed if the interaction between the robotic hand and the object is effectively sensed.  currently research and development in tactile sensing is directed toward anthropomorphic sensors which attempt to match the sensing capabilities of the human skin and which resemble its mechanical properties.  this proves to be a great and exiting challenge.  the spatiotemporal sensing resolution of the human skin with thousands of mechanoreceptor organs in the finger pad areas and its large sensing range spanning from 10ths of milli newtons up to tens of newtons generate very demanding specifications for the design of anthropomorphic tactile sensors.
this research will focus on new tactile sensing technologies for robotic arms and dextrous robotic hands. it will involve research in both distributed pressure tactile sensing in the form of highly anthropomorphic/bio-mimetic compliant artificial skins and force sensing with semi-rigid skins in the form of high accuracy monolithic force/torque sensors.  toward artificial skins new sensor designs will be researched based on the current sensing technologies such as resistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive and other technologies. new methods will be sought for developing and integrating large populations of sensing elements into compliant materials suitable to operate as robotic skins.  the candidate will tackle the technological challenges in connectivity, power, and the signal processing of the distributed sensor. the candidate will work closely within a team of researchers and technicians toward developing working systems with a final goal to integrate tactile sensing in humanoid platforms such as the coman and c-cub (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) robots and in dextrous teleoperation applications in platforms such as the kuka lwr robot, the dlr hand, and the barretthand(tm).

the ideal candidate will be a talented individual with an electronics or mechatronics background and a strong performance in hardware design projects. the candidate should be willing to work in diverse areas, ranging from simulation (matlab, maple sim, etc), hardware design and software development (c++).
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>  and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>.



theme 3.18:wearable haptic systems for dexterous teleoperation and virtual immersion
the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of virtual reality simulation or teleoperation procedure where the performed task requires the user to extensively engage his hand and fingers. in recent years the rapid improvements in hardware and software toward providing effective force/touch feedback has led to the development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various training simulators and teleoperation systems. however, in most of these instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered use are relatively poor. in addition these systems work as joysticks providing only point contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. furthermore, in existing wearable force feedback devices, such as in hand exoskeletons, high fidelity tactile feedback at the finger tip is currently absent. this means that teleoperation or simulation of tasks such as lifting a nail from a table or picking a wire from a bundle, where precision grips with tactile feedback at the fingertips are necessary, is not currently available.  to be of any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic interface.
this phd will concentrate on the development and integration of force and tactile feedback in a multi degree of freedom haptic system based on a semi-exoskeleton design incorporating a hand exoskeleton and a grounded haptic arm with large working, volume, high back-drivability and multimodal feedback capability. existing design directions in novel actuation systems, hand exoskeletons and tactile feedback systems developed in the department will form the foundation where this phd theme will build toward a highly integrated wearable system for precision dextrous tele-manipulation.

we are seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering physical sciences or robotics. experience and competencies in cad mechanical design and knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit. (mechanical design 50%, kinematics 30%, control 20%)
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>  and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>




theme 3.19: development of a high performance haptic tele-manipulation system
haptic teleoperation systems using dexterous robotic hands offer potential benefits to many applications, for instance manipulation of objects/materials in hazardous or inaccessible environments (nuclear, space, chemical, etc), minimally invasive surgery and telemedicine. however, making these systems intuitive and transparent represents a big challenge for robotic research. this phd will focus on the development a high performance haptic teleoperation system for the dextrous manipulation of remote objects. the remote site of the system will consist of a compliant robotic arm integrated with a dexterous robotic hand and the operator site will consist of a hand exoskeleton with tactile feedback displays at the fingertips. the teleoperation system will work in an impedance control fashion. in that, the hand exoskeleton worn by the human operator will provide measurement of the human finger positions to be used for controlling the finger positions of the remote robotic hand. the interaction forces measured by the robotic hand when grasping remote objects will be presented to the operator's fingertips through the hand exoskeleton. tactile feedback from the remote interaction will also be presented at the operator's fingertips through the integrated tactile displays. within the framework of a teleoperation platform the candidate will work on algorithms for visual, haptic and tactile feedback, spatial mapping between the human hand and the robot hand and for addressing the time delay of the teleoperation system. to integrating tactile feedback in teleoperation alterative approaches to direct tactile sensing will be considered such as model based tactile feedback. a range of sensors will be considered for estimating the location, the shape and possibly material properties of the remote objects. in particular vision tracking and object recognition from the remote scene will assist in generating accurate models of the remote environment for application in haptic feedback.

interested candidates holding a master degree in mechanical / electrical engineering, computer science, or other related fields are invited to apply for admission. applicants should ideally have strong competencies in one or more of the followings areas: haptic interfaces, system modelling/ rigid body dynamics, robot control and c/c++ programming.
for further details concerning this research project, please contact: nadia.garcia at iit.it<mailto:nadia.garcia at iit.it> and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>


theme 3.20: development of a multimodal vr platform for a haptic hand exoskeleton
in haptics the simulation of touch is performed with force feedback/kinaesthetic devices which generate interaction forces to the user's hand and through tactile feedback devices which simulate small scale contact interactions with the skin. in virtual reality there is an increasing demand for powerful simulators able to provide kinaesthetic and tactile feedback to human operators through multi-fingered haptic devices such as hand exoskeletons and to simulate haptic interactions with virtual objects. this project aims at developing a high performance multimodal vr platform for grasping, manipulating and exploring virtual objects using a multi-fingered hand exoskeleton integrated with tactile feedback displays at the fingertips. the multimodal vr platform will allow the control of the hand exoskeleton based on a multi-point and soft-finger contact interaction and will create highly realistic simulations. multi-fingered interaction with rigid and also deformable objects will be considered for the development of the vr platform. for generating the appropriate control signals for the hand exoskeleton according to the forces obtained from the virtual interaction the mapping of the kinematics of the virtual hand, the user's hand and the exoskeleton will be addressed. tactile feedback to the user will be considered both for the simulation of contact through vibration and through high fidelity shape recreation with integrated tactile feedback arrays located at the exoskeleton's fingertips. to achieve the project's goals the successful candidate will be expected to develop novel algorithms for (1) precise collision detection between a virtual hand and rigid/deformable virtual objects, (2) generating the tactile and force feedback to the fingertips based on a multi-point and soft-finger contact and (3) controlling the hand exoskeleton and the fingertip tactile display hardware.
interested candidates holding a master degree in computer science, mechanical / electrical engineering, or other related fields are invited to apply for admission. applicants should ideally have strong competencies in one or more of the followings areas: hci (human computer interaction), haptic interfaces, robot control and c/c++ programming. any additional experience in robotics research will be a plus.

theme 3.10: haptic exploration for humanoid navigation with a compliant robot
tutor: dr nicolas perrin, dr nikos tsagarakis

humans are able to modify their usual strategy for locomotion in order to move in a cluttered environment without any visual information.
the goal of this phd research program is to perform this difficult task with a compliant humanoid robot. more precisely, we will study the problem of navigation in an unknown environment with a ""blind"" humanoid robot. this may require haptic exploration with the feet to find flat and stable surfaces, or arm motions to check for the absence of obstacles or on the other hand find safe contacts to increase balance.
the successful candidate will investigate various algorithms and multi-contact planning strategies in order to solve this problem in complicated environments. in a first phase, quasi-static motions might be considered, but trying to maximize the robot speed will ultimately be an objective of prime importance. because of their increased ability to absorb shocks, it is expected that passively compliant robots can perform blind navigation faster than other robots, and the successful candidate should try to demonstrate this hypothesis.
experiments will be made on the passively compliant coman platform (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) developed at the department of advanced robotics of the iit. solving this complex problem in a robust way is expected to have an impact far beyond the sole application of blind navigation.

requirements: the ideal candidate should have a degree in engineering or computer science (or equivalent), be highly motivated to work on robotic platforms and have very strong computer programming skills, including experience with c/c++ in the unix environment. good writing and communicating skills in english are essential.

theme 3.11: dynamic stabilization of biped robots based on imu data.

tutor: dr nicolas perrin, dr nikos tsagarakis

while well-known force/torque control methods can be applied to set a compliant equilibrium configurations for a biped robot whose feet are assumed to remain at a fixed position on the ground. things are much more complicated when the feet of the robot are expected to move, either because the robot is walking or because large external disturbances might require feet displacements.
the goal of this phd research program is to study the potential benefit of having an imu sensor fixed at the robot waist. in a first phase, the successful candidate will design and study control algorithms using imu feedback for the stabilization of a biped robot whose feet are not expected to move. for example, these control algorithms might only try to enforce a horizontal orientation of the robot waist at all time. the algorithms should be flexible enough to allow extensions in which the feet could move, and might take their inspiration in the simple control algorithms used for the stabilization of segway pts. in a second phase, various stepping strategies will indeed be considered and combined with the previously designed control algorithms to obtain a dynamic stabilizer that can perform various tasks such as push recovery or stabilization during walking with potential footstep modifications. experiments will be made on the coman platform (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) developed at the department of advanced robotics of the iit.

requirements: the ideal candidate should have a degree in engineering or computer science (or equivalent), knowledge in dynamics and control, be highly motivated to work on robotic platforms and have strong computer programming skills, including experience with c/c++ in the unix environment. good writing and communicating skills in english are essential.

theme 3.12: humanoid walking and motion planning: walking on uneven terrains, particulate surfaces and terrains with different stiffness properties.

tutors: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr nicolas perrin

despite the significant progress made in humanoid locomotion during the past decade most current humanoids still suffer from major problems related to dynamically equilibrated walking, stable walking and physical interaction with the environment. looking at humanoid locomotion developments it can also be observed that most of them have been performed on flat surfaces. this is a very ideal surface property compared to surfaces existing in human environments where stairs, inclined surfaces, small obstacles and even rough surfaces may exist. up to now, there are only a few effective demonstrations of walking and motion planning in this kind of environments.

a new humanoid robot (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) has been developed under the european fp7 project amarsi (htp://www.amarsi-project.eu/). this newly developed robot has compliant joint structures which will eventually enable us to obtain feasible jumping/running characteristics through the use of the natural system dynamics. in addition, it has 6 axis force/torque sensors at the ankles and the feet soles are also equipped with 5 point 1-axis force sensors to detect feet contact with the ground. such a sensory system created on the feet soles will permit exploration of walking on:

a)    uneven terrains and stepping over obstacles
b)    particulate solid surfaces consisting of particles of different size and density
c)    surfaces of different stiffness.

techniques will be developed to plan the motion and regulate both dynamic equilibrium and body/feet posture in order to achieve walking on uneven surfaces avoiding or stepping on obstacles with variable inclinations, on particulate surfaces such as sand or to pass through surfaces with different stiffness properties. these methods will take into account kinematics/dynamics and self-collision constraints while detection of the terrain properties will be assisted by rich sensory feedback from the feet of the humanoid. in particular, we will explore how to detect rough terrain/obstacle properties such as inclination and stiffness using the contact force sensors located on the sole of the feet. having determined the rough terrain characteristics, how the balance stability is affected when the robot is on this specific rough terrain will be evaluated and different control and trajectory planning methodologies will be developed to allow the humanoid to pass through different terrains while maintaining stability and balance.

requirements: the ideal candidate should possess strong background in physical system modeling and control, matlab and c/c++ programming.  knowledge on mechatronics hardware, fundamental robotics and rigid body dynamics is a plus.

the details of the phd position are as follows:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.1: developmental robotics and robot learning for agile locomotion of compliant humanoid robots 

** tutor:  dr petar kormushev, dr nikos tsagarakis 

developmental robotics offers a completely different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. for example, currently, the majority of bipedal walking robots use variants of zmp-based walking with largely simplified models of the robot dynamics. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot legs, the locomotion repertoire of current bipedal robots merely includes slow walking on flat ground or inclined slopes, and primitive forms of disturbance rejection. this is far behind from even a two-year old child.

the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving more agile locomotion. however, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of developmental robotics and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in developmental robotics.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

requirements: this is a multidisciplinary theme where the successful candidates should have strong competencies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and good knowledge of robot kinematics and dynamics. the candidates should have top-class degree and a background in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. required technical skills: c/c++ and/or matlab. knowledge of computer vision is a plus.

department of advanced robotics
italian institute of technology

theme 3.24 development of reconfigurable multifinger robot for carton folding using the virtual prototyping (cae)

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella

nowadays the packaging is one of the technology applied worldwide because all the goods exchanged (sold or bought) are packed. half of the study in this field is on the speed manufacturing that reached very good results for simple boxes; the complex carton, in the inverse, are far from reliable solutions and large part of this production is still by hands. despite this huge effort, till now few manipulators are built suitable for factories (as d-raps or archaps) and that demonstrates the difficult of this challenge.  in fact, the reconfigurability of the cartons not only requires dexterous manipulator, but for make competitive the device, even a deep  knowledge of the cartonboard. goal of this phd is to design and build a new reconfigurable device able to fold origami carton autonomously depending on the initial final shape. this mechanism will be useful for study the cartonboard behaviour during the folding and the new design of them. that means a virtual prototype of this device will be done in order to simulate the manipulation, so the best solution will be found quicker, because few physical prototyping will be necessary. so the study will be divided in two part: carton board mechanical properties investigation and carton folding manipulator design. the first one involves the experimental tests on carton and paper in order to determine the crease and panels stiffness. second one concerns the theory of the manipulation and hierarchy of the panel rotation. together will permit to simulate the physic modelling of origami carton folding. considering the small forces and torques used in these folding, the feedback in the control will be very complex because the measurement signal are always very weak compared to the noise given by the cartonboard dynamics (e.g. the backlashes or panel bending). the paten should be another goal of this study.
this work will be developed in strong collaboration with king's college of london, uk under supervision of prof. jian s. dai
requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in mechanics. the background must be in mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics. the ideal competencies should be in multibody simulation/finite element analysis and robot dynamics and control.

required technical skills: 50% mechanics, 25% control, 25% kinematics

theme 3.25: development of dynamic investigation test-rig autonomous in haptics (ditah) for detecting the neuropathy

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella

touch and related capabilities, such as kinaesthesia, are probably the most underrated human abilities. most researches, in fact, have concentrated on the visual and audio aspects of the sensory systems, but touch in daily life plays a fundamental role in all our actions; losing part of this sensitivity causes a problem in accomplishing even simplest tasks. the uncomfortable condition increases with the increasing of peripheral neuropathy. therefore it is important to detect these diseases in the earliest stages, because in most cases it is impossible to recover, but it is possible only to slow them down or, in some cases, to stop them. current physical inspections lack in objectivity and comparison among results, because they depend on the doctor' sensitivity and on empiric tests; that leads to have a very low resolution scale of illness and to identify the peripheral neuropathies only when they are full-blown. the aim of this project is to add a new device to the screening in order to make it more objective, to reduce the threshold and to record the results; this will permit not only to detect the diseases in earliest stages but even to compare the follow-up inspections determining the neuropathy progression. this device will be full of sensors to measure all the anatomic and the biometric parameters (fingertip dimensions, skin elasticity, applied force, displacement, force, etc) in order to check the state of health of the patient thanks the touch sensitivity. to build the ditah (dynamic investigation test-rig autonomous in haptics) the study must proceed in two different fields: the first one is about the psychophysics and/or neuroscience, because experimental tests will be carried out for collecting data to define the performance of the device; moreover, analyzing these results a more accurate scale of peripheral neuropathy diseases will be determined; the second one concerns the test-rig building, so the electronics, control and the computer programming are necessary to create a new device that is suitable for clinical use. it must be very safe, user friendly and reliable to permit a very accurate patients screening.

this work will be developed in strong collaboration with università degli studi di brescia, at the clinica neurologica under supervision of prof. paolo liberini.



requirements: this project is open to two different phd candidates, one with more interest in psychophysics/neuroscience and the other in control/computer programming. the candidates will work within an international environment on the development and control of the ditah. we are ideally seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering, physical sciences or robotics.

theme 3.13: dynamic walking and running of compliant humanoid robots on rough terrain
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1

the application of humanoids in the human environment requires the mobility of walking and running on the reconstructed terrain in contrast to a prepared and known lab environment. there are a plenty of existing methods, such as the zmp based pattern generation, which can provide dynamically feasible trajectories for walking and running on a flat ground. however, most of the methods are designed for the humanoid robots with stiff actuations. due to the high stiffness of the actuators, the capability of adapting the rough and uneven terrain is very limited. moreover, a more agile and dynamic movement requires a more compliant interaction with the environment in order to reduce the impacts. these essential demands can be solved by designing the smart mechanism that exploits the intrinsic compliance as the nature shows in biological land animals.

with the new compliant hardware and the task of walking on the rough terrain, there is a raising demand of a new control methodology that makes use of the physical compliance for smooth interaction and provides the feasible controllers to generate variety types of walking and running gaits. differ from the engineering approaches from which a lot of artificial constraints are unnatural imposed, such as the zmp method, the new research would investigate the results from the passive dynamic walkers and the nonlinearity of the step-to-step transitions. typically for humans, walking and running do not necessarily involve symmetric or periodic alternation of legs. the limit cycle approach investigates the cyclic gaits which demonstrate self-stability.  the proposed research topic will focus on the extraction of the fundamental principles of the limit cycle method previously applied on passive dynamic walkers (typically gravity powered walking). a number of methods for controlling the kinetic energy will be studied and further extend it to a more general principle for dynamic walking and running. the implementation and experimental validation will be finally conducted on the rough terrain. the research platform for testing the hypotheses is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.


theme 3.14: stabilization and balance control of the compliant humanoid robots
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1

while operating in human environment, the humanoid robots permanently have the risk of colliding with unexpected objects and falling. to tackle the collisions and prevent a fall are crucial regarding the safety for both humans and robots. the stabilization of the proposed research will focus on the passivity based compliance control to attenuate the undesired oscillations and movements caused by impacts during the robots’ interaction with the environment, especially for the robots with physical compliant materials.

the balancing control will investigate different strategies to maintain the equilibrium. for small and moderate disturbances, the robot could balance without taking steps. however, since the capability of keeping balance is limited given a fixed size of the support area, the robot must exploit other strategies such as taking steps when the increasing disturbance is able to topple the robot. the proposed research will develop the balance control using both the simplified model and a full body dynamics model. the feedbacks for the balance control will require the sensor fusion of a number of different signals, such as the linkage positions (proprioception), the reaction forces acting in feet (haptics) and the inertial measurement (inner ears). the algorithms are expected to be tolerant to parameter variations and robust to different types of disturbances (external pushes and terrain surface variations). the research platform for testing the algorithms is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in:
1. rigid body dynamics, mechanics;
2. classical and modern control theory;
3. programming skills (matlab, c/c++);
4. good english proficiency.

candidates are encouraged to send their cv prior to application. for further details concerning the research project, please contact: dr. zhibin li, email: zhibin.lixat iit.it; dr. nikos tsagarakis, email: nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it.

theme 1:
event-driven vision: developing bio-inspired vision systems for the humanoid robot icub
smart vision sensors, instead of merely reproducing with high accuracy the visual scene, are capable of transducing the sensory signal in a way best suited to extract relevant information for behaviour. to build such types of sensors, a growing community is taking inspiration from biological perceptive systems that show performance so far unreachable by artificial sensory systems. mapping the characteristics of biological sensory perception onto artificial systems allows them to be inherently capable of better performances and, at the same time, be compact, low power, low cost, robust to noise and capable of adapting to ever changing working conditions, making these products suitable for real world real time applications. the ""neuromorphic"" icub is equipped with one of such smart sensors, the dynamic vision sensor [1], that asynchronously sends information about scene changes. the use of bio-inspired sensors on such a sophisticated robotic platform allows for the development of dynamic tasks where the robot interacts with the environment. this short project aims at developing event-based algorithms based on the output of the dvs sensor, to guide the behavior of the robot in selected demonstrators.
the performance of the humanoid robot icub, equipped with the newly developed vision system, will assess quality and advantages of the method.
the successful candidate holds a phd degree in computer science, robotics or similar and a background in artificial vision.

theme 2:
hierarchical inverse dynamics position/force control of floating-base constrained robots
floating-base robots (e.g. humanoid robots, walking robots) are a well-known class of underactuated systems, so they are not feedback linearizable as standard industrial manipulator. for this reason, the control of floating-base robots is still nowadays a challenging and active research field. this short-term project will focus on the derivation and implementation of a control framework for floating-base robots. in particular, the test platform is going to be the highly redundant humanoid robot icub. following the latest ideas of analytical dynamics and inverse dynamics control, we want to devise a computationally efficient software for multi-task position-force control. in particular we are interested in a scenario in which the robot has to balance and reach with one of its hands (extending some of our previous work). the robot could also make contact with the environment, to extend its reachable workspace, so force control has to be addressed. requirements: the candidate should have a strong background in analytical dynamics and c++ programming. a good knowledge of control theory is also expected.

theme 3:
human detection for face-to-face human robot interaction
recent research in robotics is trying hard to push robots out of factories and research laboratories. effective operation in everyday environment requires the ability to detect humans and interact with them. most of the successful vision-based strategies for people/pedestrial localization are tuned for ""at distance"" scenario (see (dollar, wojek et al. 2012) for a review) and are not well suited for ""face-to-face"" human robot interaction scenarios. initial approaches for egocentric vision attempt mainly to infer the social environment where humans move (fathi, li et al. 2012; park, jain et al. 2012) and rely on face detection and orientation estimation. this information only allows performing simple inference about the social interaction in the scene and it loses almost all the information about actions which are mainly conveyed by limb motion. in more complex cases, where also the type of actions has to be inferred (e.g. pointing, grasping etc.), the egocentric vision algorithm has to also estimate the localisation and orientation of limbs. this problem is not yet efficiently solved in unconstrained scenarios with egocentric vision-like sensors. this project will be performed on the icub robot (metta, sandini et al. 2008), with the aim to implement efficient tools for the detection of human body parts from the cameras in the head of the robot. we will develop new methodologies for detecting human body parts at close distance such has torso, arms and face (i.e. upper body). the input data will be the disparity and optical flow maps obtained from the stereo pair embedded in the robotic head as well the raw color images from the cameras. we will also consider using kinematic models to improve localization.

this project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also have computer programming skills and be motivated to work on a robotic platform.

theme 4:
reaching along with whole-body balancing through real-time nonlinear constrained optimization
over the recent years, research on humanoid robotics has been giving an increasing attention to the problem of whole-body coordination. indeed, as hardware components get constantly and quickly upgraded for bipedal platforms such as asimo, hrp4, icub, new theories and control frameworks are conceived to let humanoids behave safely during interaction in human environments. in this context, the purpose of the short-term project is to enhance the motor capabilities of the icub robot, currently available for the reaching tasks, by incorporating a balancing system which will allow maintaining the upright posture on the legs in a scenario where the robot will perform complex bending movements with the upper-body limbs to attain far objects. in particular, a methodology that has been lately demonstrated to be effective in dealing with highly redundant structures makes use of state-of-the-art optimizers that can solve online for a given kinematic task, subject to a set of nonlinear constraints. the objective would be therefore to extend this approach including force/torque measurements and real-time control design to account for the robot dynamics and meet the balancing requirement.
requirements: the candidate should have a strong background in control theory and software engineering. knowledge of nonlinear optimization techniques would be beneficial.giorgio metta <giorgio.metta at iit.it>

phd fellowship

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional

167,2013,iit phd position in exploration haptic sensation,"exploration of haptic sensation and its use in detecting peripheral neuropathy
development of a novel touch based gripper for detecting peripheral neuropathy

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella
touch and related capabilities, such as kinaesthesia, are probably the most underrated human abilities. most researches, in fact, have concentrated on the visual and audio aspects of the sensory systems, but touch in daily life plays a fundamental role in all our actions; losing part of this sensitivity causes a problem in accomplishing even simple tasks. moreover, nowadays, the touch is widely used to screen neurological diseases. improving the accuracy, sensitivity and repeatability of the physical inspections would improve the recognition of such peripheral neuropathies. the core of this proposal is to determine a simple and objective (above all not influenced by the doctor skill and experience) test that highlights the patient diseases (as dysfunction of the recurrent pyramidal circuit, neuromuscular junction, primary motor neuron diseases, etc.). one of the straightforward connections between the brain and the environment is the motor cortex (cxm1) which controls complex movements by activation of the motor neurons. thus, the idea is to simulate the healthy human grasping by building a human upper limb model (with its tactile sensor feedback) controlled by a network structure of the primary motor cortex model. till now there have been numerous theories attempting to explain such sequence of operations in terms of a variety of motor control models; in fact, the accomplishment of a movement is a rather complex task: the simplest movement as pointing a given point in the space requires a non-trivial sequence of operations. another point is that a realistic model should be able to encode and decode the ascending tactile signals; moreover, considering the tactile feedback, the model must be bidirectional brain-muscle-brain. in the last decades, there have been several successful results in linking the information flow from neural cells to fingertip tactile sensitivity and arm movements: in lukashin  et al. (lukashin 1996) the movement of an arm was accomplished by six independent muscles governed by an artificial neural network model which input layer received spikes of single cell recordings; cisek et al. (cisek 1998) proposed a model of the cortical-spinal circuitry designed to cope with a wide range of movements in linking the information from neural cells to movements: gerling et al. (gerling 2013) modeled a 3d finite element fingertip linking all the previous models of touch: skin mechanics to neural firing rate, neural dynamics to action potential elicitation and mechanoreceptor populations to psychophysical discrimination; bologna et al. (bologna 2013) modeled the fine touch with peripheral-to-central neurotransmission closed loop.
the novelty of this work is to reproduce the two human fingers grasping with a network structure of the primary motor cortex model that controls the upper limb model (with its tactile sensor feedback). thus, the aim is to build a robotic arm (fingertip-hand-arm-brain) with not only the same structure (skin, bones, muscles, tendons, etc.), but, above all, with the same neurological system (mechanoreceptors, proprioceptors, brain cells, etc.) of human upper limb. this arm simulator will be able to reproduce the kinematic behaviour of a healthy human arm and it will serve as reference for further comparison with ill people; in valente et al. (valente 2012) a reference scale for peripheral neuropathy was established. by building a close-loop brain-arm-brain, the project aims to setup a realistic simulation environment able to improve medical doctors' diagnosis (e.g. brain diseases can be tested altering the circuit).
the work is divided in three parts: the first part is about assembling several test rigs for collecting the experimental data to determine the mechanical properties, kinematic characteristics and the parameters for models. the second one will concern the building of a real time kinematic simulation of fingertip, hand, forearm and arm 3d finite element/multibody models with acquired data based on 3d virtual visualization and validation with experimental data. the third part consists in designing the physical robotic simulator.
this activity will evolve along different research paths in collaboration with the neuroscience and brain technologies department (with thierry nieus) and the cnr of palermo (with michele migliore) as well as with other research centers in europe (université pierre et marie curie of paris with angelo arleo).
the successful candidate is expected to have an excellent background in mathematical modelling. knowledge of mechanics, computer science, biomedical measurements, statistics, electronics and control are also required. basic knowledge of neuroscience is considered as a plus.

===========================================================================

description: realizing proficient human robot collaboration is a fundamental
challenge for robotics and in recent years it is becoming more and more
central, as robots use becomes more pervasive in society. in particular, an
important question is how to translate humans’ social skills into
human-robot interaction. we suggest that the efficient human mutual
understanding relies substantially on the implicit, non-verbal communication
associated to human motion (1, 2, 3). our approach aims at understanding
which robotic features promote natural and fluid human-robot interaction,
using robots both as tools to investigate human brain functions and as test
bed for the derived models. currently we are testing the motor and
perceptual principles usually adopted in human collaboration - as goal
anticipation (4, 5), automatic imitation (5), context-dependent perception
(6), weight understanding from action observation (7,8) - during human-robot
interaction experiments with the icub platform. the topic we propose as phd
activity is to further investigate how to establish efficient human - robot
collaboration by exploiting the natural mechanisms in place for human
interaction. the research will be based on designing different human-robot
interactive scenarios and assessing the efficiency of the collaboration and
the acceptance by the user, by means of multiple techniques, as
eye-tracking, motion capture and force measurements. the successful
candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the
osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie
curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her
knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes. 

requirements: background in computer sciences, robotics, computational or
behavioral neurosciences is required, as also willingness to make
experiments with human participants and strong motivation to work and adapt
to a multidisciplinary environment.

description: social skills play a fundamental role since the very early
development stages. infants present a marked inclination for social
interaction, ranging from the preference for biological motion and mutual
gaze to imitation of facial expressions and auditory, oral, and motor
matching. such social inclination is supported by the gradual evolution of
the production and understanding of social signals, such as gestures, gaze
direction and emotional displays. to gain a deeper understanding of this
crucial stage of human development our goal is to design models of the
perceptual primitives supporting the acquisition of social skills in infants
and to test them on a humanoid robot. computer vision and machine learning
state-of-the-art methods will be the building blocks of the research to be
carried out. 

requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer
engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving. a
background on computer vision is an asset.

phd position opening on:

*“haptic device design, development, and application to *

*rehabilitative training based on multimodal action observation”*

*
*

* *

there is currently an opening for a phd position in the robotics, brain,
and cognitive sciences department (rbcs) at the istituto italiano di
tecnologia (italian institute of technology, iit) to work on the
development of a novel tactile feedback device for enhancing stroke
rehabilitation.  the phd candidate will work directly with an international
and interdisciplinary team of researchers: dr alberto ansaldo, dr. michela
bassolino, dr. netta gurari, and grzegorz bubak.  iit is located in genoa,
italy with state-of-the-art laboratories and international collaborations
in the field of robotics, neuroscience, cognitive systems, and
nanotechnologies. the three years position is fully funded, with a start
date of january 2014, and international applications are encouraged.


the goal of this research path is to enhance the effectiveness of available
rehabilitative training methods for stroke patients with motor deficits by
using an intervention based on multimodal action observation. action
observation is defined as the process of observing an action being
performed by others. in the last few years, a growing body of evidence
supports the notion that patients with motor disorders may have an improved
rehabilitative experience if they use action observation in addition to the
currently available traditional physical therapy (e.g., ertelt et al.,
2007, *neuroimage*; small et al., 2010, *developmental psychobiology*;
franceschini et al., 2013, *neurorehabil neural repair*).

the phd candidate will investigate whether the addition of veridical
tactile stimulation to action observation can enhance the brain plasticity
over solely observing an action. the phd candidate will create prototype(s)
of tactile feedback device(s) for relaying artificial cutaneous information
to a human (e.g., skin stretch, vibration) using both readily available and
novel actuator technologies. the candidate will test the effectiveness of
these devices by using both behavioral and neurophysiological methods, such
as psychophysics testing and transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms). the
aim is to have a device finalized and ready for use in rehabilitative
treatment of stroke patients at the completion of the doctoral work.

this work will be conducted alongside an interdisciplinary team of
researchers, currently representing three unique research fields
(neuroscience, mechanical engineering/haptics, materials science) and three
different countries (italy, usa, poland). the applicant should be excited
to work in such a collaborative environment, and be possibly interested in
spending a portion of his/her time conducting research in the usa and/or
switzerland. ideally, we are looking for candidates who have a background
in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science,
electrical engineering, experimental psychology, or closely related fields.
participants should be motivated to develop a novel tactile feedback device
(with support from the *robotics, brain and cognitive sciences *department
staff), to program visual and haptic virtual environments, and to perform
human subject testing with the device. we are looking for applicants who
have a proficiency in both written and spoken english and who are excited
to pursue a career in conducting scientific research.

tutors: dr. zhibin li, dr. roy featherstone, dr. nikos tsagarakis
department: advr (istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the capability of walking endows humans to traverse most landforms. however, to negotiate with discrete terrains, counteract large disturbance, and travel fast, the ability to jump, hop, and run becomes a must.

the research will explore the theoretical aspects of physics for jumping, hopping and running in order to discover the necessary physical attributes of a leg that is suitable at these tasks. the control aspects of jumping, hopping and running will also be explored in order to develop control schemes that obtain the highest possible performance from a given leg.
the candidate is expected to perform experiments on the leg prototype in order to investigate the practical and technical aspects of achieving high performance. the aim should be to demonstrate a level of performance that exceeds any existing leg designs demonstrated in literature. the leg compliance will also be studied for improving the stability and robustness given a set of physical parameters of the leg such as mass distribution, inertia.

requirements: the candidate should work as part of a team with the responsibility for analyzing the leg's performance at jumping, hopping and running, and suggesting approaches in which the leg design could be improved candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in rigid body dynamics, mechanics, classical and modern control theory, programming skills (matlab, c/c++) (dynamics/control %70, programming 30%).

theme: whole-body cooperative manipulation during dynamic locomotion
tutors: dr. zhibin li, dr. jinoh lee, dr. nikos tsagarakis
department: advr (istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the research aim is to develop a control framework that permits the humanoid robots to form multiple compliant contacts to perform cooperative manipulation tasks with humans while resolving the balancing, walking, and redundancy issues.

the algorithms to be developed should interpret certain level of motion intention from human operator through the contacts with the shared object so as to allow the robot to cooperate with human with no requirement of additional vision assistance. the phd candidate is expected to explore different control approaches such as optimal control, impedance control to robustly execute the manipulation tasks while undergoing external disturbances, limited sensor resolutions, non-modeled contact conditions (uncertainty from friction, elastic objects), and deal with the redundancy problem in real-time. apart from the control aspect, traditional sensory feedbacks such as joint torque, end-effector force/torque, as well as the novel sensory techniques such as robotic skins, will be investigated as well. the whole control framework might partition the manipulation task and the balancing or walking task as different modules, but since they are dynamically coupled, it has to consider the interplay between these sub-tasks in order to generate a smooth and dynamically stable whole-body motion. the algorithms will be tested on the full-body intrinsically compliant humanoid robot coman with torque control features (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html).

requirements: candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in rigid body dynamics, classical and modern control theory and good programming skills (matlab, c/c++) (dynamics/control %70, programming 30%).

both are in the area of robot learning, as described below.

theme 8. developmental robotics and robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus around developmental robotics and robot learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot motor skills.

developmental robotics offers a qualitatively different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current humanoid robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts.

this phd theme aims to bring forward advances in the quality of robot motor skills towards biological richness. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use oversimplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff
robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. and developmental robotics offers one promising alternative for achieving this.

the phd theme will explore developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn novel skills. at the same time, robots should be capable of natural and robust interaction with people. the focus of the research will be on intelligent exploration techniques, robot learning and human-robot interaction.

description: the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offers a significant potential for achieving more agile locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

theme 8. developmental robotics and robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus around developmental robotics and robot learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot motor skills.

developmental robotics offers a qualitatively different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current humanoid robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts.

this phd theme aims to bring forward advances in the quality of robot motor skills towards biological richness. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use oversimplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff
robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. and developmental robotics offers one promising alternative for achieving this.

the phd theme will explore developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn novel skills. at the same time, robots should be capable of natural and robust interaction with people. the focus of the research will be on intelligent exploration techniques, robot learning and human-robot interaction.

185,2013,phd position in development of a reconfigurable multi-finger robot for packaging applications,"19. development of a reconfigurable multi-finger robot for packaging applications

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. lando mentrasti

nowadays the packaging is one of the technologies applied worldwide because all the goods exchanged (sold or bought) are packed. half of the study in this field is on the speed manufacturing that reached very good results for simple boxes; the complex carton, in the inverse, are far from reliable solutions and large part of this production is still by hands. despite this huge effort, till now few manipulators are built suitable for factories (as d-raps or archaps) and that demonstrates the difficult of this challenge.  in fact, the reconfigurability of the cartons not only requires dexterous manipulators, but for making competitive the devices, it is necessary even a deep knowledge of the cartonboard. goal of this phd is to design and build a new reconfigurable device able to fold origami carton autonomously depending on the initial final shape. this mechanism will be useful to study the cartonboard behavior during the folding and the new design of them. that means a virtual prototype of this device will be done in order to simulate the manipulation, so the best solution will be found quicker, because few physical prototyping will be necessary. thus the study will be divided in two parts: carton board mechanical properties investigation and carton folding manipulator design. the first one involves the experimental tests on carton and paper in order to determine the crease and panel stiffness:
*     micro-model of cartonboard (fibers networks simulation): micro-scale crease stiffness
*     meso-model of cartonboard (multilayer): meso-scale crease stiffness (finite element): creasing process design
*     1:1-model of cartonboard (one layer):  1:1 scale crease stiffness (finite element + multibody simulation): damage
*     macro-model of the cartonboard (on line): macro-scale crease stiffness (multibody simulation+analitycal model of the crease stiffness)
second one concerns the theory of the manipulation and hierarchy of the panel rotation. together they will permit to simulate the physic model of origami carton folding. considering the small forces and torques used in these folding, the feedback in the control will be very complex because the measurement signal are always very weak compared to the noise given by the cartonboard dynamics (e.g. the backlashes or panel bending). the paten should be another goal of this study.
this work will be developed in strong collaboration with king's college of london, uk under supervision of prof. jian s. dai
requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in mechanics. the background must be in mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics. the ideal competencies should be in multibody simulation/finite element analysis and robot dynamics and control.
required technical skills: 50% mechanics, 25% control, 25% kinematics

197,2014,three (3) marie curie early stage research fellowships at istituto italiano di tecnologia,"bc: 69409- 69410- 69411

marie curie early stage researcher



job title:  marie curie fellow



post: position with an enrolment on a doctoral training programme



the department of advanced robotics (advr) at the istituto italiano di tecnologia - iit (an english speaking institute) located in genoa is seeking to appoint 3 marie curie early stage researchers (esr) in the framework of the

fp7 marie curie itn smart-e (sustainable manufacturing through advanced robotics training in europe).



smart-e is a doctoral training network, funded by the eu commission’s fp7 marie curie programme, with the aim to prepare the next generation of leading experts in advanced robotics to secure a sustainable manufacturing sector in europe.



the network involves the collaboration of eight european institutions - the university of salford, university of zurich, scuola superiore sant'anna, istituto italiano di tecnologia, technical university of munich, festo, airbus and advanced manufacturing research centre at the university of sheffield.



the network is bringing together leading experts in the field of embodied intelligence, compliant, soft robotics, advanced manufacturing, industrial robotics and automation, smart materials and machine learning in europe. you will utilise new technologies (mostly pioneered by smart-e) in state of the art training environments.



the successful candidate will benefit from high quality industrial experience

and interdisciplinary projects that are individually tailored.    the research

training programme will combine technical expertise acquisition with business & leadership, communication and entrepreneurial skills in order to provide you with the skills, knowledge and confidence to tackle not only the technical challenges, but also to play a key role in embedding/deploying these solutions into practical applications.



the researchers will have at least 2 placements outside of their host organisation; this may entail a short stay outside their host country.







theme 1: development and control of robot manipulators for safer physical human robot interaction.

the focus of this research is the design optimization, development and control of a novel compliant manipulator and related actuation systems with variable physical damping actuators (vpda,

http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/variable-physical-damping-actuators.html)

for robust, fast, adaptable and damage-safe motions and interactions. the target is to improve the capabilities of the existing compact(tm) arm

(http://www.iit.it/en/robots/compact-arm.html) by exploring both the mechatronic technological limits (structural materials, actuation and sensing) and new design and control philosophies towards the development of high performance manipulation systems. the department of advanced robotics at iit possesses a strong industrial know how in this field  with 5+ patents.

in detail, the main goals of the project are to:

*     improve via technology and develop actuators that are more robust, more

stable, have reduced oscillatory behaviour, lower cost, have less friction and wear, etc.

*     focus on the introduction of, and improvements in, other physical

impedance parameters, e.g. damping or effective inertia through techniques originally developed for the vpda,

*     build a prototype of the upper body of a robot for physically

interactive manipulation testing and to compare mature technologies for lightweight robots (kuka lwr) with via and vpda technologies.

the resulting developed systems will be capable of:

*     more safely co‐existing and co‐operating with people (co-workers)

and other robots;

*     attain performance levels more commonly associated with humans.

theme 2: development of a high performance haptic tele-manipulation system interaction between humans and machines, particularly safe interaction, is a critical aspect of robotics. the focus of this research is the development of high fidelity user interfaces for telepresence and teleoperation that can rival the human hand in terms of manipulating dexterity, see http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/haptic-and-interaction-technologies.html. within this research new haptic technologies and techniques will be applied to the control and operation of the coman humanoid

(http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html)

and particular to the development of a high performance, teleoperation system that will use enhanced levels of haptic feedback to ensure accurate, high precision and dexterous control and manipulation of remote objects using a coman as the remote system.

the main goals of the project are to:

*     enhance the nature of the operator interface at the remote and the user

site

o     at the remote site to use a compliant torque controlled robot arm to

improve control accuracy,

o     at the user site to develop high accuracy hand exoskeletons, finger tip

tactile displays and tele-impedance control to augment the user experience and improve transparency.

within the framework of a teleoperation platform the esr will work on:

*     development of algorithms for visual, haptic and tactile feedback,

*     spatial mapping between the human hand and the robot hand and

*     addressing the time delay of the teleoperation system.

theme 3: dexterous human-robot collaborative manipulation through learning using compliant robots within unstructured spaces the recent development of compliant robots such as coman

(http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html)

has opened up a host of new research possibilities in human-robot interaction and robot learning. now, robots need not be behind fences (as in large manufacturing plants), and are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires drastic changes in the way robots move, learn, react, and physically interact with the users and environment and this flexibility should be in the software as much as the hardware, i.e. flexibility through learning.

this work will address research themes related to the problem of transferring bimanual collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner.

such skills involve rich and diverse research questions such as passive/active roles switching, leader/follower behaviours, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, intention recognition in joint action and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent. these issues will be studied in two contexts: 1) with bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant humanoid robot coman; 2) within a manufacturing scenario with an innovative setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.

the goals of the project are to:

*     develop a dexterous semi-autonomous teleoperation schemes for compliant

robot operating in not well defined spaces with uncertain physical interactions.

*     cope and learn to adapt to collisions and physical interactions .

*     exploration of haptics in teleoperation of compliant robots  for

improving performance as well for providing guidance to the operator in the context of bidirectional coupling.

*     development of data and knowledge fusion technique for the dexterous

manipulation to learn how to detect collisions and react to physical interactions

*     development of a refined control model for flexible regulation of

stiffness and damping behaviours of the compliant robot

the proposed phd research project will be focused on “representing 
peripersonal space through sensorimotor likelihoods”.
on the ground of the research framework developed in the pspc lab at 
dibris (see www.eyeshots.it, [1]), the activity will focus on the design 
of theoretical models by converting computational approaches from

peripersonal space. such implicit representations, besides advancing 
experimental predictions about neuronal activity,  are expected to drive 
learning of meaningful interactions with the environment thus achieving 
fluid multi-dimensional motor control in the presence of multiple 
sensory channels, and with minimal a priori knowledge.

please note that iit is an english-language research institute, so it is not required to speak italian.

there are two phd positions open for themes 21 and 22.
both are in the area of robot learning, as described below.

-----------------------------------------------------

theme 21. robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

description: despite the significant mechatronic advances in robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts. motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus on machine learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning of motor skills. the type of motor skills that will be investigated include object manipulation, compliant interaction with objects, humans and the environment, force control and vision as part of the robot learning architecture.

the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant robot control.

ideas from developmental robotics will be considered, in search for a qualitatively better approach for controlling robots, different than the currently predominant approach based on manually-engineered controllers.
the work within this phd theme will include developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn new skills. at the same time, the methods should allow for natural and safe interaction with people. to this end, the research will include learning by imitation and reinforcement learning, as well as human-robot interaction.

-----------------------------------------------------

theme 22. robot learning for agile locomotion
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, dr. nikos tsagarakis

description: the state-of-the-art high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offer a significant potential for achieving more agile robot locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, coping with multiple contacts with the environments, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

tacman addresses the key problem of developing an information processing and control technology enabling robot hands to exploit tactile sensitivity and thus become as dexterous as human hands. the current availability of tactile technology now allows us to considerably advance in-hand manipulation. tacman's goal is to develop fundamentally new approaches to endow robots with tactile manipulation abilities by transferring insights from human neuroscientific studies into machine learning algorithms. 

we are looking for a young researcher with strong motivation to work with robotic platforms and skills to investigate and implement algorithms that exploit tactile feedback for object manipulation. 

possible scenarios are:
touch-driven exploration and recognition of objects
grasping and re-grasping objects to achieve stable grip

applications to the phd in bioengineering and robotics - università degli
studi di genova are open!

 

the phd program in biogengineering and robotics is rooted in the multiple
ongoing collaborations between università degli studi di genova/university
of genoa ( <http://www.unige.it/> www.unige.it), fondazione istituto
italiano di tecnologia/italian institute of technology foundation (
<http://www.iit.it/> www.iit.it) and the university of cagliari (

application modalities can be found at http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/
and http://www.iit.it/en/openings/phd-calls/2015.html.

 

within the program, i would like to draw your attention on the following
research theme, highly interdisciplinary, with elements of computer science,
cognitive science and robotics, and very ambitious in its scope: 

 

learning visual cues of interactions for humanoid robots

theme n. 10 - curriculum on “cognitive sciences, interactive and
rehabilitation technologies”.  

tutors: prof. francesca odone  (dibris università dei genova) prof. giulio
sandini (rbcs dept., iit), dr. alessandra sciutti (rbcs dept., iit)

 

description: since the earliest stage of their development, humans learn how
to interact with other people. more specifically, babies begin to decode
their own movements by acquiring visual evidence of the result of their
motor commands. then, as soon as they learn to perform a given action they
also start to anticipate its outcome even when they see it executed by
others. hence, the knowledge accumulated by acting is exploited to
understand and predict someone else’s intention. 

 

the general goal of this project will be to provide icub with a similar
ability that will guarantee a more natural and proficient interaction with
human users. the pipeline of the computational system includes an
attentional module able to localize the portion of the scene containing
biological motion. then, icub exploits this information to focus on the
selected area and to describe it more precisely using its stereo system. 

 the visual properties of the observed movements will be used by the robot
to decode the intentionality of the interacting partner by using machine
learning techniques. view-invariance will be one of the crucial aspects of
the system, together with the capability of inferring information about the
3d orientation of an agent.

dear all.

in the context of the robotics and autonomous systems curriculum of the 
phd program in bioengineering and robotics, i would like to advertise 
the following themes:

** theme 1: biologically inspired approaches to perception, knowledge 
representation and action in robotics

goals:

1) design, develop and validate a framework allowing a bi-manual robot 
to learn bio-inspired, neural-based representation structures related to 
real-world objects using force, vision and proprioceptive information.

2) use the developed representation structures to assess knowledge 
encoded in suitable neural spaces, in order to reason about goals, plans 
and actions. representation structures will refer to capabilities (i.e., 
what a robot gains in considering them) and affordances (i.e., what 
possible actions they entail).

3) provide the robot with means to carry out planned actions while 
monitoring their execution at run-time to implement multi-modal 
sensory-motor couplings.

** theme 8: spatial, temporal and common sense reasoning in robots

goals:

1) design and develop innovative techniques to represent heterogeneous 
and multi-modal sensory data. such data will encode real-world objects 
and events the robot perceives and interact with, taking into account 
both spatial and temporal features.

2) investigate novel (software) architectures and planning frameworks 
for action (including the use of language) able to exhibit integrated 
(task-level) symbolic and continuous planning capabilities, as well as 
to modify and adapt the robot representation structures and planning 
schemes on the basis of its experience.

* theme 3, cooperation/competition in a haptic dyad

there is a growing interest in physical coupling between humans. for example, it was found that haptic interaction with a human partner leads to a better performance than individuals in tasks involving either motor or force control. one reason may be that mutual haptic feedback can enhance the process of intention integration between the two partners at an implicit level. moreover, physical interactions are consistently beneficial to the interacting individuals and enable them to improve their motor performance both during and after interactive practice. this makes dyadic interaction extremely appealing from a motor learning perspective, since the use of paradigms that promote dyadic motor adaptation can be of great advantage during training and also in rehabilitation. however, it is not yet clear how dyadic physical interaction shapes motor adaptation and the mechanisms that mediate intention understanding are still poorly understood. a deeper knowledge in these areas is fundamental to advance into the development of haptic platforms for interactive systems and protocols for effective haptic communication, with the goal of modeling interactive strategies & adaptation mechanisms and ultimately designing in an optimal way haptic systems that support effective and versatile dyadic paradigms of physical interaction.

requirements: a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences. expertise in virtual reality, assistive technologies and haptics will constitute factors of preference.

214,2014,phd position on tactile object exploration,"1 phd position with scholarship at the istituto italiano di tecnologia.

* theme 6, tactile object exploration.

recent advances in tactile sensing have renewed the interest in the
development of control strategies that exploit tactile feedback to control the
interaction between the robot and the environment. indeed, it has
been shown that tactile feedback can complement or even substitute for vision for
grasping, especially in those situations in which a model of the environment is not
available. in humans it is believed that haptic exploration is fundamental to generate
structured information to extract object properties like size, volume and shape.

the goal of this phd project is to implement on the icub strategies for object
exploration and grasping based primarily on haptic feedback. to this aim we will use
the sensory system of the icub which includes a system of tactile sensors (fingertips,
hands and arms) and force sensors. we will also study algorithms for extracting
haptic features during object exploration and apply them to the problem of object
recognition.

learning. he would also be highly motivated to work on robotic platform and have

physical structure of perception and computation” lab of the department 
of informatics, bioengineering, robotics, and system engineering 
(dibris), university of genoa, italy.

the proposed phd research project will be focused on “learning 
compositional visual representation of 3d shapes in vergent geometry”.

the goal is to derive a deep architecture for abstracting the 
statistically relevant information present in the disparity patterns 
obtained by binocular fixations. starting from a neuromorphic early 
representation of 2d binocular disparity, the resulting 3d visual 
descriptors should be characterized by generalized perceptual constancy.

the project will provide the opportunity to work on neural modeling, 
visual psychophysics, computer vision, or a combination of them. 
experimental, modeling, and theoretical approaches might be pursued with 
a different accent according to personal attitude.
ongoing cooperation, at international level, with research groups of 
different disciplines, will ensure a highly interdisciplinary and 
stimulating environment.

successful applicants will have at their disposal state-of-the-art sw 
and hw, 3d vr-ar experimental set-ups, a high precision 3d laser 
scanner, a large-scale cpu/gpu-based neuromorphic architecture for joint 
stereo and motion cortical representation, and an icub 6dof binocular

220,2014,phd positions on event-driven vision for icub,"1 phd position with scholarship the starting november 2014 at the icub facility, istituto italiano di tecnologia

* theme 3, event-driven vision for the icub

interacting with a dynamical environment is one of the major challenges of robotics. biology clearly outperforms robotic systems when acting in real scenarios in terms of appropriateness of the behavioural response, robustness to interference and noise, adaptation to ever changing environmental conditions, and energy efficiency. all these properties arise from the characteristics of the radically different style of sensing and computation used by the biological brain. 
in conventional robots, sensory information is available in a sequence of static snapshots and high dynamics can be sensed only by increasing the sampling rate.

however the available bandwidth limits the amount of information that can be transmitted forcing a compromise between resolution and speed. event-driven vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. the proposed theme aims at the exploitation of highly dynamical information from event-driven sensors for robust interaction of the humanoid robot icub with moving objects. the goal is to develop new techniques for the recognition and prediction of trajectories of moving targets including humans and objects and plan for precise reaching movements, by exploiting the high temporal resolution and compressive signal encoding of event-driven vision sensors mounted on the icub.
research will focus on the development of the infrastructure for handling eventdriven sensory data and of event-driven vision algorithms for motion estimation as well as algorithms for trajectory prediction. real time behaviour will be achieved by using compressive event driven computation and on-board processing on fpga.

wysiwyd will create novel ""transparency"" in human robot interaction (hri) by allowing robots to understand both their and human actions and to interpret and communicate them in human compatible intentional terms expressed as a language-like communication channel. wysiwyd will contribute to a qualitative change in human-robot interaction (hri) and cooperation, unlocking new capabilities and application areas together with enhanced safety and robustness. in this context it is fundamental that robots perceive humans and understand their communicative intentions. however, the most successful vision-based strategies for people localization are developed for ""at distance"" scenarios. these techniques are not well suited for typical ""face-to-face"" hri, where human detection is made difficult by occlusions and large variability in pose and scale.

the research of this postdoctoral project aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art in terms of visual perception for hri. we are looking for a highly motivated young researcher with strong motivation to work jointly in computer vision and robotics. this project will be carried out on the icub robot with the aim of implementing efficient tools for the detection of human body parts by using computer vision. we will develop new methodologies for detecting human body parts at close distance such as torso, arms and face with the goal of determining the intention of the human (gaze direction, relative position, hands configuration etc.).

the contract will be issued within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis).

we seek a candidate with the following skills:
- phd in robotics, computer vision or related areas;
- ability to analyse, improve and propose new algorithms;
- good knowledge and proven experience in c/c++ programming as well as familiarity with robotics middleware such as yarp, ros and development tools including cmake, and git.

235,2014,postdoc openings - new techniques for  vision-assisted speech processing," istituto italiano di tecnologia (http://www.iit.it<http://www.iit.it/undefined/>) is a private foundation with the objective of promoting italy's technological development and higher education in science and technology. research at iit is carried out in highly innovative scientific fields with state-of-the-art technology. http://www.iit.it/ icub facility (http://www.iit.it/icub) and robotics, brain and cognitive sciences (http://www.iit.it/rbcs) departments are looking for 2 post-docs to be involved in the h2020 project ecomode funded by the european commission under the h2020-ict-2014-1 call (topic ict-22-2014 - multimodal and natural computer interaction). job description: robust automatic speech recognition in realistic environments for human-robot interaction, where speech is noisy and distant, is still a challenging task. vision can be used to increase speech recognition robustness by adding complementary speech-production related information. in this project visual information will be provided by an event-driven (ed) camera. ed vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. in an audio-visual speech recognition setting ed vision can not only provide new additional visual information to the speech recognizer, but also drive the temporal processing of speech by locating (in the temporal dimension) visual events related to speech production landmarks. the goal of the proposed research is the exploitation of highly dynamical information from ed vision sensors for robust speech processing. the temporal information provided by edc sensors will allow to experiment with new models of speech temporal dynamics based on events as opposed to the typical fixed-length segments (i.e. frames). in this context, we are looking for 2 highly motivated post-docs, respectively tackling vision (research challenge 1) and speech processing (research challenge 2), as oulined herebelow: research challenge 1 (vision @ icub facility - bc 69721): the post-doc will mostly work on the detection of features from event-driven cameras instrumental for improving speech recognition (e.g. lips closure, protrusion, shape, etc?). the temporal features extracted from the visual signal will be used for crossmodal event-driven speech segmentation that will drive the processing of speech. in the attempt to increase the robustness to acoustic noise and atypical speech, acoustic and visual features will be combined to recover phonetic gestures of the inner vocal tract (articulatory features). research challenge 2 (speech processing @ rbcs - bc 69724): the post-doc will mainly develop a novel speech recognition system based on visual, acoustic and (recovered) articulatory features, that will be targeted for users with mild speech impairments. the temporal information provided by edc sensors will allow to experiment with new strategies to model the temporal dynamics of normal and atypical speech. the main outcome of the project will be an audio-visual speech recognition system that robustly recognizes the most relevant commands (key phrases) delivered by users to devices in real-word usage scenarios. the resulting methods for improving speech recognition will be exploited for the implementation of a tablet with robust speech processing. given the automatic adaptation of the speech processing to the speech production rhythm, the speech recognition system will target speakers with mild speech impairments, specifically subjects with atypical speech flow and rhythm, typical of some disabilities and of the ageing population. the same approach will then be applied to the humanoid robot icub to improve its interaction with humans in cooperative tasks. skills: we are looking for highly motivated people and inquisitive minds with the curiosity to use a new and challenging technology that requires a rethinking of visual and speech processing to achieve a high payoff in terms of speed, efficiency and robustness. the candidates we are looking for should also have the following additional skills:   *   phd in computer science, robotics, engineering (or equivalent) with a background in machine learning, signal processing or related areas;   *   ability to analyze, improve and propose new algorithms;   *   good knowledge of c, c++ programming languages with proven experience. team-work, phd tutoring and general lab-related activities are expected an internationally competitive salary depending on experience will be offered. please note that these positions are pending the signature of the grant agreement with the european commission (expected start date in early 2015) how to apply: challenge 1: send applications and informal enquires to jobpost.69721 at icub.iit.it<mailto:jobpost.69721 at icub.iit.it> challenge 2: send applications and informal enquires to jobpost.69724 at rbcs.iit.it<mailto:jobpost.69724 at rbcs.iit.it> the application should include a curriculum vitae listing all publications and pdf files of the most representative publications (maximum 2) if possible, please also indicate three independent reference persons. presumed starting date: challenge 1: january 2015 (but later starts are also possible). challenge 2: june 2015 (but later starts are also possible). evaluation of the candidates starts immediately and officially closes on november 10th, 2014. references: lichtsteiner, p., posch, c., & delbruck, t.

name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 6. sensing humans: enhancing social abilities of the icub platform description: there is general consensus that robots in the future will work in close interaction with humans. this requires that robots are endowed with the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues and human intentions. such capabilities are fundamental prerequisites to program the robot to react appropriately to humans and to bias the interpretation of the scene using nonverbal cues (gaze or body gestures). the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social intentions. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot or his posture and intentions. conventional research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on applications in which the image patch of a whole person (or group of people) is visible without strong occlusions in. on the other hand, face-to-face interaction requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and alessio del bue (email: name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 7. spatial modeling of three-dimensional maps from stereo and rgbd sensors description: the ability to acquire high-resolution depth information allows for using three-dimensional geometries to build detailed shapes. the latter is fundamental for tasks that require complex interaction between the robot and the environment like balancing, walking or object grasping/manipulation. local shape information can in fact used to segment the scene and plan foot or hands placement to stabilize the robot or the fingers to achieve a stable grip of objects. this is a challenging task because it requires observations on both the geometry and the visual appearance of the surrounding surfaces, in relation to the body of the robot. to perform such tasks, features need to be extracted from the data allowing different regions to be compared and matched. depending on the complexity of the viewed scene, these features can be extracted from the depth data alone or need to be augmented with those extracted from images. the aim of this phd is to study the general problem of scene understanding by combining three-dimensional depth observations with visual appearance from images. the goal is to investigate novel features for local shape description and machine learning techniques for classification. we consider tasks like locomotion and object manipulation in scenarios that involve whole-body control. requirements: the ideal candidate would have a degree in computer science, engineering or related disciplines, with a background in computer vision and machine learning. he would also be highly motivated to work on robotic platform and have computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and tariq abuhashim (email: name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 8. event-driven human and action detection for the icub description: interacting with a dynamical environment is one of the major challenges of robotics. biology clearly outperforms robotic systems when acting in real scenarios in terms of appropriateness of the behavioural response, robustness to interference and noise, adaptation to ever changing environmental conditions, and energy efficiency. all these properties arise from the characteristics of the radically different style of sensing and computation used by the biological brain. in conventional robots, sensory information is available in a sequence of static snapshots and high dynamics can be sensed only by increasing the sampling rate. however the available bandwidth limits the amount of information that can be transmitted forcing a compromise between resolution and speed. event-driven vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. the proposed theme aims at the exploitation of highly dynamical and sparse information from event-driven sensors for fast detection of humans and action recognition. the automatic motion based segmentation performed by the event-driven cameras allows for fast detection of regions of interest. the research focus will be the exploitation of this segmentation for the detection and recognition of moving body parts to implement fast real-time human detection and action recognition. the ultimate goal is to improve awareness and interaction skills of the icub robot. requirements: degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. high motivation to work on a robotic platform and good programming skills. reference: benosman, r.; clercq, c.; lagorce, x.; sio-hoi ieng; bartolozzi, c.,

research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong

the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in

its research activity led to the creation of 10 start-ups, with additional 13 start-ups currently being launched (http://www.iit.it/images/stories/scientific_plan/iit-8-year-eng-final.pdf). the aial-advanced industrial automation lab (http://www.iit.it/it/advr-labs/advanced-industrial-automation.html) has a number of fully funded phd openings (starting in november 2015). young scientists with excellent first/master degrees (in computer science, mechanical/electrical engineering or other related fields) and strong competencies and interest in one or more of the followings areas (physical system modelling/rigid body dynamics, reconfigurable mechanism, robot control, mechanism design, mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics, matlab and c/c++ programming) are invited to apply for admission. the successful candidates will be involved in basic/applied research projects based on the virtual prototyping design method (http://www.iit.it/it/virtual-prototyping-design.html) that permits to build very detailed numerical models of the robots and then to improve strongly their performances and design. they will closely interact with all the other advanced robotics labs and groups as well as the r&d of large enterprises (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-projects.html) and abroad research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen

265,2015,phd opening: event-driven affordances 	for the icub," the icub facility department at the fondazione istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit) is looking for talented ph.d. candidates in the context of humanoid robotics.the position is available through the phd course of bioengineering and robotics, curriculum on advanced and humanoid robotics. the successful applicant will join the icub facility department at the istituto italiano di tecnologia in genova, morego (http://www.iit.it/icub). description: grasping and manipulation are two necessary skills of a robot that needs to reliably work and cooperate with humans. the performance of a robot when interacting with objects heavily relies on robot calibration, 3d scene reconstruction and accurate action execution. in realistic environments all of the above is prone to errors that can result in failure of the planned action. in humans, such errors are counterbalanced by adaptive behaviours that build on the knowledge of the results of actions and on the early detection of failures that allows for the execution of corrective actions. the goal of this project is to learn the behaviour of objects during clumsy or imprecise manipulation and grasping, and using this knowledge to plan and perform corrective actions. a bad grasping will cause the object to fall in specific ways, the robot can then learn the association between a specific action parameter (for example hand pre-shaping, direction of grasping, object 3d configuration, etc.) and the trajectory of the falling object, effectively learning its ?falling affordances?. the robot can then use this information to better plan the next grasping action on the same object and to perform corrective actions. this task will rely on the integration of traditional color-based high spatial resolution vision with accurate and fast observation of the object motion by event-driven cameras, characterised by extremely high temporal resolution. requirements: degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. high motivation to work on a robotic platform and good programming skills. references: [1] benosman, r.; clercq, c.; lagorce, x.; sio-hoi ieng; bartolozzi, c., ""event-based visual flow,"" neural networks and learning systems, ieee transactions on , vol.25, no.2, pp.407,417, feb. 2014, doi: 10.1109/tnnls.2013.2273537 [2] tikhanoff, v.; pattacini, u.; natale, l.; metta, g., ?exploring affordances and tool use on the icub?, 2013, ieee/ras international conference of humanoids robotics contacts: chiara bartolozzi, vadim tikhanoff, ugo pattacini (email: name.surname at iit.it<mailto:name.surname at iit.it>) * how to apply notice that the positions are available through the phd course of bioengineering and robotics, curriculum on advanced and humanoid robotics, offered jointly by iit and the university of genova. the official call and application forms are available on the website of the university of genova. the official calls are available here: http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/index.php/how-to-apply/themes (advanced and humanoid robotics) applications must be submitted online, instructions for applicants are available here: http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/index.php/how-to-apply * application deadline: 10 june 2015, 12pm italian time ------------------------------- vadim tikhanoff, phd senior postdoctoral researcher icub facility istituto italiano di tecnologia vadim.tikhanoff at iit.it<mailto:vadim.tikhanoff at iit.it> via morego, 30 16163 genova +39 010 71781 881 www.iit.it"

module robotic software for novel  robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on  automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of  manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low  volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to  quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive  to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots,  sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is  very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software  framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal  of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software  based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive,  easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means  the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost  every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile  also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the  developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the  experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from  the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since  it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the  virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body  and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit  these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable  for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali

caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the  flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the  results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances.  the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the  flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is  still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is  affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the  settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the  potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power  for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the  elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these  results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders  as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic  link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project)  improving the design part which takes in account the structure  behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control  to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between  robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial  applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd

robotics, university of genoa, italy. please note that iit is an english-language research institute, so it is not required to speak italian. iit has state-of-the-art facilities and has rapidly established itself among top research institutes worldwide. iit has a strong international character, with more than 40% foreign scientific staff drawn from over 50 countries worldwide. the successful applicants will join the robot learning and interaction lab of iit, department of advanced robotics: http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/learning-and-interaction the applicants can choose from the following four themes: 26, 27, 28 and 29 as described below. further information is available at: http://kormushev.com/news/phd-positions-in-robotics-and-machine-learning-for-2016/ ----------------------------------------------------- theme 26. robotic surgery with improved safety using machine learning for intelligent robot tele-operation and partial autonomy tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: flexible hyper-redundant systems are becoming of increasing interest in medical applications where the flexibility of the robot can be used to direct the surgery around delicate tissues, however, these system are highly non-linear with complex dynamic making them very difficult to control. this project will develop and implement machine learning algorithms to improve the intelligence of control and perception in flexible devices and enhance safety. the advantages of using machine learning will be investigated in multiple potential areas, as follows: in low-level robot control using model learning approaches; in feedback control considering multi-modal input from position, force and pressure sensors; in tele-operation using learning of context-dependent skills for assisting the human operators (surgeons). the work will also investigate the possibility of using partial autonomy at a lower control level using reactive strategies for robot control. with respect to safety the project will consider how to use the development of learning algorithms to automatically detect abnormalities during robot teleoperation. these abnormalities may include excessive forces/pressure, excessive bending, unusual signals potentially indicating problems during the medical procedure. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 27. novel robot control paradigms enabled by machine learning for intelligent control of the next generation compliant and soft robots tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: despite the significant mechatronic advances in robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts. motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus on machine learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning of motor skills. the type of motor skills that will be investigated include object manipulation, compliant interaction with objects, humans and the environment, force control and vision as part of the robot learning architecture. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant robot control. ideas from developmental robotics will be considered, in search for a qualitatively better approach for controlling robots, different than the currently predominant approach based on manually-engineered controllers. the work within this phd theme will include developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn new skills. at the same time, the methods should allow for natural and safe interaction with people. to this end, the research will include learning by imitation and reinforcement learning, as well as human-robot interaction. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 28. agile robot locomotion using machine learning for intelligent control of advanced humanoid robots tutors: dr. petar kormushev, dr. nikos tsagarakis description: the state-of-the-art high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offer a significant potential for achieving more agile robot locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion. the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, coping with multiple contacts with the environments, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 29. dexterous robotic manipulation using machine learning for intelligent robot control and perception tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: this project will investigate collaborative human-robot task learning and execution that uses the available perception (particularly tactile). the work will develop algorithms for learning of collaborative skills by direct interaction between a non-expert user and a robot. the tasks will build the necessary control algorithms to allow effortless and safe physical human-robot interaction using the available tactile feedback. the final objectives will include: acquiring the perceptual information needed for robot to co-manipulate an object with human, understanding human's state in an interaction task so as to react properly, building a framework for online compliant human-robot interaction based on real-time feedback of the state of the object and human. the project will also consider semi-supervised and unsupervised skill learning approaches. it will develop tactile-guided autonomous learning algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods for reinforcement learning and deep learning. the tactile feedback will help to increase the performance of skill execution autonomously by the robot through trial-anderror interactions with the objects in the environment. in addition this work will focus on supervised skill learning approaches. it will develop tactile-guided learning algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods for learning by imitation and visuospatial skill learning. the tactile perception information will be used both in the learning phase and the execution phase, to improve the robustness and the range of motor skill repertoire. ----------------------------------------------------- requirements: background in computer science, mathematics, engineering, physics or related disciplines. how to apply: to apply please

the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen

suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer

the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new

293,2015,two fellowship positions on haptics and  vision for teleoperated mobile manipulation on eu euroc project at italian  institute of technology (iit)," the department of advanced robotics at the istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit), an english-language research institute in genoa, italy, is looking for two highly motivated full-time fellows with key research roles in the area of mobile manipulation. the selected applicants will join the advanced industrial automation laboratory and have the opportunity to pursue research within the fp7 european robotic challenge (euroc) project funded by the european commission under contract no. 608849. the project will involve collaboration with a consortium of leading universities and research institutes in europe and will last until december 2017. the main objectives of this project are to drive innovation in european robotics and manufacturing, and to strengthen collaboration and cross-fertilisation between the industrial and the research communities. towards this aim euroc has launches and will run three industrially relevant challenges in european robotics with applicability to the factory of the future (c1: reconfigurable interactive manufacturing cell; c2: shop floor logistics and manipulation; c3: plant servicing and inspection). these challenges cover the most promising application scenarios, and thus, product visions, of the european robotics industry (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=euroc_project). the ""automap"" project, led by iit, is a collaboration with cern (european organization for nuclear research) within challenge c2 - shop floor logistics and manipulation and is aimed at building a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system. this challenge is based on use case operations to be carried out on cern's flagship accelerator, the large hadron collider (lhc), which is the most powerful accelerator in the world and has been in operation since 2010. the main motivation for carrying out maintenance work using a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system is to reduce maintenance personnel exposure to hazards in the lhc tunnels - such as ionizing radiation and oxygen deficiency hazards. a second motivation is that the robot will be able to autonomously carry out the same tasks in the assembly facility as in the tunnel on collimators during their initial build and quality assurance. this robotic mobile manipulation system should be easily reconfigured by non-specialist personnel to perform autonomous/semi-autonomous tasks in the unstructured environment (autonomous navigation and identification of various types of collimators). implementing a high performance teleoperation capability will also be necessary for work in the lhc tunnel to allow safe teaching and learning by teleoperation demonstration and to allow recovery without damaging delicate accelerator equipment in the event of unforeseen problems (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=automap). we are looking for two highly motivated young scientists with a background in robotics and/or mechanics/control/electronics/computer science engineering to be responsible for the following two jobs respectively: job1 -

theme 1: sensing humans: enhancing social abilities of the icub platform description: there is general consensus that robots in the future will work in close interaction with humans.  this requires that robots are endowed with the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues. the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social behaviour. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot and to react accordingly. this requires a new set of computational tools based on computer vision and machine learning to detect people at close distance. this ""face-to-face"" scenario requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and visual geometry and modelling lab (pavis department). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and alessio del bue (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 2: scene analysis using deep-learning description: machine learning, and in particular deep learning methods, have been applied with remarkable success to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques is that training requires a large amount of data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by a robot. one solution is to adopt pre-trained convolutional neural networks (dcnn) for image representation and use simpler classifiers, either in batch or incrementally. following this approach dcnns have been integrated in the icub visual system leading to a remarkable increase of object recognition performance. however, scene analysis in realistic settings is still challenging due to scale, light variability and clutter. the goal of this project is to further investigate and improve the icub recognition and visual segmentation capabilities. to this aim we will investigate techniques for pixel-base semantic segmentation using dcnns and object detection mixing top-down and bottom-up cues for image segmentation. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 3: implicit learning description: machine learning, and in particular deep learning  methods, have been applied with remarkable success to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques it that training requires a large amount of labelled data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by the robot. critical issues are how to obtain large amount of training samples, how to perform object segmentation and labelling. they key idea is develop weakly supervised frameworks, where learning can exploit forms of implicit labelling.  in previous work we have proposed to exploit coherence between perceived motion and the robot own-motion to autonomously learn a visual detector of the hand. the goal of this project is to investigate algorithms for learning to recognize object by exploiting implicit supervision, focusing in particular on the strategies that allow the robot to extract training samples autonomously, starting from motion and disparity cues. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme4: learning to recognize objects using multimodal cues description: robots can actively sense the environment using not only vision but also haptic information. one of the problems to be addressed in this case is how to control the robot to explore the environment and extract relevant information (so called exploratory procedures). conventionally, learning to recognize objects has been primarily addressed using vision. however, physical properties of objects are more directly perceived using other sensory modalities. for this reason, recent work has started to investigate how to discriminate objects using other sensory channels, like touch, force and proprioception. the goals of this project are i) to implement control strategies for object exploration, investigating to what extent different explorative strategies contribute to object discrimination, ii) the implementation of learning algorithms that allow the robot to discriminate objects using haptic information and, finally, iii) to investigate how haptic information can be integrated with vision to build a rich model of the objects for better discrimination. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 5: model driven software development in robotics description: humanoid robots are evolving at rapid pace, thanks to impressive progress in mechatronics and algorithms supporting cognitive capabilities for perception, control and planning.  proper integration of such capabilities require not only an adequate software infrastructure but also adoption of sound software engineering methodologies. research on software engineering for robotics has primarily focused component based approaches and middleware technologies (ros, yarp, orocos to mention just a few). model driven engineering is widely adopted to design complex systems in other fields but has received comparatively little attention in robotics. however, adoption of model driven approaches to the development of software systems lead to increase quality and code reuse. the goal of this project is to survey existing techniques for modeling distributed component-based robotic software systems and to develop a model-driven engineering toolkit for the icub system. the new toolkit should support the system engineer in designing, configuring, and analyzing relevant properties of control applications for the icub system.  requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility), in collaboration with the robotics laboratory of the university of bergamo. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) with a background in software engineering and, possibly, robotics. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale (name.surname at iit.it) and davide brugali (name.surname at unibg.it) -- istituto italiano di tecnologia lorenzo natale, phd lorenzo.natale at iit.it via morego, 30 16163 genova ph: +39 010 71781946 fax: +39 010 7170205 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__lornat75.github.io&d=cwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=i9wc-2hrg-n7n6dbhhlofna2rt8ezm0fpwignvsraz8&s=qhyiry7d8635mly6rfkaauw3ahooonk9lxfnbwtsrvu&e=  www.iit.it"

description: machine learning, and in particular deep learning methods, have been applied with remarkable success to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques is that training requires a large amount of data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by a robot. one solution is to adopt pre-trained convolutional neural networks (dcnn) for image representation and use simpler classifiers, either in batch or incrementally. following this approach dcnns have been integrated in the icub visual system leading to a remarkable increase of object recognition performance. however, scene analysis in realistic settings is still challenging due to scale, light variability and clutter. the goal of this project is to further investigate and improve the icub recognition and visual segmentation capabilities. to this aim we will investigate techniques for pixel-base semantic segmentation using dcnns and object detection mixing top-down and bottom-up cues for image segmentation. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. references: olga russakovsky, jia deng, hao su, jonathan krause, sanjeev satheesh, sean ma, zhiheng huang, andrej karpathy, aditya khosla, michael bernstein, alexander c. berg and

to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques it that training requires a large amount of labelled data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by the robot. critical issues are how to obtain large amount of training samples, how to perform object segmentation and labelling. they key idea is develop weakly supervised frameworks, where learning can exploit forms of implicit labelling. in previous work we have proposed to exploit coherence between perceived motion and the robot own-motion to autonomously learn a visual detector of the hand. the goal of this project is to investigate algorithms for learning to recognize object by exploiting implicit supervision, focusing in particular on the strategies that allow the robot to extract training samples autonomously, starting from motion and disparity cues. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in

actively sense the environment using not only vision but also haptic information. one of the problems to be addressed in this case is how to control the robot to explore the environment and extract relevant information (so called exploratory procedures). conventionally, learning to recognize objects has been primarily addressed using vision. however, physical properties of objects are more directly perceived using other sensory modalities. for this reason, recent work has started to investigate how to discriminate objects using other sensory channels, like touch, force and proprioception. the goals of this project are i) to implement control strategies for object exploration, investigating to what extent different explorative strategies contribute to object discrimination, ii) the implementation of learning algorithms that allow the robot to discriminate objects using haptic information and, finally, iii) to investigate how haptic information can be integrated with vision to build a rich model of the objects for better discrimination. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. references: pasquale, g., ciliberto, c., odone, f., rosasco,

description: machine learning methods have been applied with remarkable success to solve a variety of perceptual/cognitive tasks, e.g. in vision and speech. yet, current state of the art algorithms are challenged by increasing amount of high-dimensional data, possibly evolving over time. the goal of this project is to tackle the design and deployment of sound machine learning methods to learn from large/huge scale data sets possibly acquired over time in changing conditions. this problem finds natural application in the context of humanoid robotics where data are constantly made available by sensory systems. the plan is to first consider extensions of classical convex approaches such as kernel methods, by incorporating ideas such as sketching, hashing and randomization. the idea is then to further explore possibly non-convex, hierarchical (deep) learning methods, based on greedy optimization strategy. emphasis will be on developing effective solutions, while keeping optimal theoretical guarantees. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and in optimization/signal processing. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong mathematical and or/ computer programming skills. references: incremental semiparametric inverse dynamics learning, raffaello camoriano, silvio traversaro, lorenzo rosasco, giorgio

confidence with electronic hardware and be capable to conduct experiments; attitude to problem solving, and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 2:tactile sensing technologies and perception description:tactile sensing is one key topic for the development of future robots capable of complex interaction with humans and objects. design of tactile sensors as well as tactile based sensing, perception and control are challenging research topics and university of genova has gained a solid reputation in this area in the past few years, and has been involved in important international research projects related to this topic (roboskin: www.roboskin.eu; clopema: www.clopema.eu). tactile data convey information about the characteristics of the contact between the robot and the manipulated objects. this information is fundamental to proper control the grasping and manipulation; furthermore, controlled manipulation can in turn be used to extract further information useful to recognize and classify objects and contacts. the objective of the phd topic is to investigate techniques and methodologies for tactile data sensing, perception and interpretation. furthermore, since tactile data are generated by active manipulation control another objective is the study of the mechanisms relating tactile based feedback robot control and tactile data perception. requirements:applicants are expected to have strong background and experience in at least one of the following topics: robot control, machine learning, system identification. the candidates must have: very good programming skills with different languages (including c/c++, matlab/simulink); experience with electronic hardware; be capable to conduct experiments and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 3:a study about how humans perceive robots in interaction processes description:human-robot interaction is expected to play a significant role in the near future. as soon as robots will be employed in environments and for tasks requiring them to be in close contact with humans, the implications of their behaviours on human attitudes, emotions and feelings (eventually, behaviour) cannot be underestimated. we are interested in assessing and measuring the effects of controlled robot behaviours on humans, specifically in all those aspects constituting what in cognitive psychology is termed non-verbal behaviour (e.g., gestures and their parameters, head motions, gaze), while humans and robots are engaged in a collaborative activity. in fact, literature suggests that humans can be greatly influenced (at the subconscious level) by environmental and human factors, and their actions be dependent on perceptions they do not even conceptualise. the phd proposal has two main objectives: on the one hand, design, investigate and assess methods to adapt experimental protocols borrowed from behavioural and cognitive psychology to understand how human behaviour can be influenced by robot behaviour, and how humans interpret it; on the other hand, synthetize robot behaviours which take human expectations into account, and convey a specific (non-verbal) message as humans would do. to this aim, the student will have also to encode specific sensorimotor skills, which will be mediated by insights in cognitive and behavioural psychology. such skills will have to be part of a robot behavioural architecture able to allow for advanced forms of cognitive human-robot interaction. the experimental assessment will be conducted using a baxter dual-arm manipulator in the context of human-robot interaction processes, e.g., object handovers. the project will be conducted in cooperation with university college london (uk), the national institute of informatics and keio university (both in japan). requirements:ontology-based and probabilistic knowledge representation techniques. software development in c/c++. problem-solving and experimental attitude. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 4:the use of language to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning in human-robot interaction tasks description:according to the cognitive perspective on language development and evolution in humans, the language faculty plays a decisive role in the development of both rational thought and reasoning. such an approach criticises the classical paradigm which views language as a communication capability derived from thought and its basic rules as a by product, i.e., the chomsky?s notion of universal grammar. if the cognitive perspective has some degree of plausibility, then the implications in human-robot interaction scenarios can be particularly important. the main objective of this phd proposal is to investigate methods to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning capabilities by means of a dialogue-based human-robot interaction process. we aim at a scenario where a human teaches a robot about objects, their properties and mutual configurations, using both demonstration and dialogue. the robot must be able to ground sensory perceptions (e.g., visual or haptic) with the syntax and semantic clues uttered by the human during the dialogue. using the acquired knowledge, the robot will be therefore able to manipulate objects on the basis of human-provided instructions. the knowledge acquired by the robot through the human-robot interaction process and the reasoning schema are going to be represented using models whose structures are borrowed from recent studies in behavioural psychology: the student will evaluate and use such conceptual tools as probabilistic ontologies to ground knowledge expressed using the bayesian theory of subjective probability, the dempster-shafer theory and its extensions, e.g., the transferable belief model, which are typically used to manage inconsistences. the student will test and assess the developed models in a human-robot interaction scenario where a baxter dual-arm manipulator will reason upon subjective spatial knowledge. the study will involve also joint work with the japan advanced institute of science and technology (jaist), as well as interdisciplinary work with experts in computational linguistics. requirements:basic knowledge in statistics and probability theory. knowledge representation and reasoning. software development in c/c++. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 5:approximate methods for active identification description:the research will focus on system identification methods with particular attention to the role of the control action to improve (on line) the performance in terms of identification accuracy over a finite time or time. as for the system model, the so-called ?black box? paradigm will be addressed. no specific structure for the system to be identified will be assumed. the use of parametrized approximation structures will be addressed whose complexity could be tuned a priori in order to reach a suitable trade-off between model accuracy and online computational requirement. the parameters of the approximating structure will be tuned on line, when the control action will be used in order to improve the achieved model accuracy. different control methods will be addressed, based on parameterization of the control laws as well as on approximate optimization methods. requirements:system identification. machine learning. optimal control. contacts: marco baglietto <mailto: marco.baglietto at unige.it> => theme 6:cooperative robotics for the smart factory description:the application of robots within manufacturing industries dates back form the seventies and now represents a well-consolidated field of application. most of its successes could however be achieved by exploiting the possibility of generally having the robot working within well structured environments, even if rigid and therefore very much lacking of flexibility, where very many, if not all, of the robot operations could be planned in advance in their very details; and then executed with the required precision levels. accordingly with the horizon 2020 strategic research agenda (sra) and related multi annual roadmap (mra) (but see also the recently launched european challenge euroc) all a set of challenges for the future factories have been therefore foreseen, also including the following important topics, by the way also addressing the specific needs of sme manufacturers: - cost effectiveness at low lot sizes, - intuitive to be used, - easily adaptable to a wide variety of application tasks, - easily reconfigurable modular kinematic structures, - modular kinematic structures intrinsically exhibiting self-organizing properties (in terms of their reconfiguration and relevant motion control), - exhibiting cooperation capabilities (with other robotic agents, as well as with humans during manipulation, assembly, transportation, etc.). the proposed phd program will address the last four of the above listed topics, by basing the activities concerning real time control and adaptation of the involved structures (mainly the self organization of modular robotic structures and cooperation capabilities) on some recent research results; clearly indicating the possibility of managing the mentioned topics within the same uniform, distributed and even decentralized, real time functional and algorithmic architectures. progresses in this direction are therefore expected as outputs of the phd program; to be then experimented, for some typical manufacturing problems, within a strict integration with the higher levels of planning, decision and command, whose shift toward more abstract and simplified symbolic representation should actually be allowed, in the light of the expected real time control and adaptation results. to the above aims the phd program will exploit different hardware resources for its experimental results; namely a crawler mobile manipulator for outdoor environments, two youbot platforms and a baxter bi-manual robotic system. requirements:mechatronics. multi-body kinematics and dynamicstheory. robotics. the candidates must also have: strong programming skills (c/c++, matlab/simulink); attitude to problem solving, to conduct experiments, and finally be motivated to work within a research team in collaborative projects. contacts: giuseppe casalino <mailto: giuseppe.casalino at unige.it>"

performing it and learning its motor and sensory consequences.  the general aim of this project will be to provide the humanoid robot icub with a similar visuo-motor matching skill in order to endow it with a human-like ability to understand human actions. in particular the robot will have to learn the motor (efference copy) and sensory (visual, joint angles, forces) consequences of its own actions to build a complete action representation. the research should determine which are the visual information needed to allow the recall of this model when the robot observes the same action performed by someone else. the work might take advantage of a computational system already available on the robot designed to localize the portion of the scene containing biological motion and extract some of its visual features .  the successful candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes.  requirements:?

before august 25, 2016. suggested phd themes (other creative ideas within the hri2 scopes are welcome!): theme-1: multimodal interfaces for human-robot co-manipulation (tutors: dr. luka peternel and dr. arash ajoudani) physical human-robot interaction and cooperation are two fundamental and necessary aspects for integrating robots into our daily lives. the robots are expected to help us in various tasks, of which many require collaborative effort to be successfully completed. in order to achieve such behaviour, the robot must be able to physically interact with the human counterpart and predict the intentions of the human, despite the additional interaction with the uncertain and unpredictable environment. appropriate robot control methods therefore are essential for the robot to deal with various uncertainties, dynamically aspects and complex task requirements. a promising direction towards this goal is to adaptively regulate mechanical parameters of the robot, based on the task requirements and external feedback. another important aspect of robot control in human-robot interaction/collaboration is the presence of the human. the human behaviour is usually highly unpredictable and difficult to model. indeed recent work at hri2<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_watch-3fv-3de3t5odke6-5fc-26feature-3dyoutu.be&d=dqifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=jolzot_uf25zewxzlbfiu1wy4qcsrlv0vpgftgpi3my&s=tdy558lzxl87khn3vcfyi0k0idiemwmm5z7jxzojrra&e= > laboratory aims at developing appropriate human-robot interfaces to enable the robot to predict or extract the human intention from various feedback modalities (human motor behaviour, vision, interaction force, voice commands, etc.). in addition, other key aspects such as role-allocation in human-robot cooperation and partner's skill evaluation, which can enable the robot to adapt its behaviour to accommodate for different level of competence and capability of the human will be explored. theme-2: design and control principles for power augmentation devices (tutors: dr. wansoo kim and dr. arash ajoudani) exoskeletons are wearable robotic devices that are used for human body power augmentation or rehabilitation. such mechanism could prove indispensable in addressing problems of injuries and growing elderly population. as the exoskeleton is attached to the human body, it is imperative that appropriate control methods and human-robot interfaces are developed to enable coordinated motion and assistance in the complex daily tasks. the main objective in this research line is the development of appropriate control strategies to facilitate the interaction between the human, the power augmentation device and the environment. in addition, hri2 aim at developing novel power augmentation devices, therefore, we highly encourage applications for hardware developments as well. theme-3: shared authority approaches in humanoids control (tutor: dr. arash ajoudani) the need to manipulate objects and tools in unstructured or hostile environments has led to the development of several master-slave teleoperation interfaces: from the most basic, unilateral position-based, to bilateral force-reflecting systems. notwithstanding the widespread use of such frameworks, they are known to lack substantial requirements to render an appropriate interaction performance (e.g. soft interactions in unilateral and stability in the latter). therefore, the main objective of this theme is to address such limitations by the development of novel and intuitive interfaces for the execution of dynamic remote manipulation tasks. our objective is to extend the recent developments at hri2 laboratory<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_watch-3fv-3ddo1o0elhvuy-26feature-3dyoutu.be&d=dqifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=jolzot_uf25zewxzlbfiu1wy4qcsrlv0vpgftgpi3my&s=kbmhaz4bsoxxnlxwcekfympvoykfxhj2ower9yxmeqe&e=

candidate with strong ambition to apply her/his engineering knowledge to the exciting area of robot-assisted laser microsurgery.     this position will be dedicated to the engineering of mechatronic solutions to bring our robotic laser microsurgery technologies to clinical use. it is a great opportunity to apply your engineering knowledge to the development of very important real-life robotic systems with potential to greatly enhance healthcare.   given the required level of precision and dexterity laser microsurgeries are difficult operations that currently can only be performed by expert surgeons. however, we have shown that robotics can transform and greatly improve this scenario. our robotic systems have already shown that they can help surgeons perform more precise and safer operations, which can lead to better quality surgeries and much better outcomes for the patients. in the current stage we are working with head & neck surgeons and a surgical laser company to create the next generation surgical system for transoral laser microsurgeries. this process involves the refinement and development of new surgical robot prototypes, as well as their evaluation in collaboration with our partner surgeons.    we are seeking to hire an outstanding msc student (or recent graduate) with strong interest in the design, development and control of robotic systems for microsurgical applications to assist in this technology transfer and innovation process. the successful candidate will work in a multidisciplinary team including roboticists, biomedical engineers, interaction researchers and surgeons. she/he will interface with engineers from the company and from iit to translate research results into a commercial surgical system. this will involve customization of current technologies and potentially the development of new robotic systems in collaboration with the laser company.   desired qualifications:  * background in engineering   * experience in the design and development of mechatronic systems   * experience in the implementation and programming of embedded systems  * experience in cad-based mechanical design  * creativity and proactive attitude  * independent and persistent personality  * strong communication and english language skills (both written and spoken) are required.     ================================   internship in robot-assisted cancer detection & treatment systems   the biomedical robotics lab is looking for an international, well-motivated and outstanding internship candidate with strong ambition to pursue a research career.   this position will involve research and development activities related to the topic of robot-assisted cancer detection and treatment. this is a highly important research area given that cancer is a leading cause of mortality today, making the improvement of diagnosis and treatment methods a high priority challenge in healthcare. robots can offer significant assistance to make cancer treatment effective and efficient. they can help surgeons completely eradicate tumors with minimal damage to healthy tissue. for example, in throat cancer surgery robots can enhance surgical precision and allow better preservation of vital functionalities such as breathing, deglutition and vocalization. nevertheless, the vast majority of cancer operations today completely depends on the experience and judgment of the surgeon to define the borders of the tumor and decide how much tissue to excise from the patient. this is a situation we want to improve by increasing the objectivity of surgical decisions. therefore, our group is investing on research and development of new robotic systems able to not only enhance the dexterity of surgeons, but also to detect cancer in real-time, which will allow higher precision surgeries with maximum preservation of healthy tissue.   to assist in this work, we are seeking to hire an outstanding msc student (or recent graduate) with strong interest in biomedical sensors, surgical robotics and systems integration. the successful candidate will work in a multidisciplinary team including roboticists, biomedical engineers, physicists and surgeons. she/he will collect and analyze data from controlled surgical operations on ex-vivo tissue realized with our robot-assisted laser microsurgery system. in addition, she/he will also have the opportunity to use information from the novel cancer sensors to enhance the surgeon's perception and automate the control of the robot for specific surgical tasks.   desired qualifications:  * background in engineering, physics or related discipline  * experience in real-time data acquisition and processing  * experience in machine learning and pattern recognition techniques  * experience interfacing computer systems and technological (e.g. robotic) devices  * creativity and proactive attitude  * independent and persistent personality  * strong communication and english language skills (both written and spoken) are required. _____________________________________ leonardo mattos, phd head of biomedical robotics laboratory   istituto italiano di tecnologia

before august 30, 2016. suggested phd themes (other creative ideas within the hri2 scopes are welcome!): theme-1: multimodal interfaces for human-robot co-manipulation (tutors: dr. luka peternel and dr. arash ajoudani) physical human-robot interaction and cooperation are two fundamental and necessary aspects for integrating robots into our daily lives. the robots are expected to help us in various tasks, of which many require collaborative effort to be successfully completed. in order to achieve such behaviour, the robot must be able to physically interact with the human counterpart and predict the intentions of the human, despite the additional interaction with the uncertain and unpredictable environment. appropriate robot control methods therefore are essential for the robot to deal with various uncertainties, dynamically aspects and complex task requirements. a promising direction towards this goal is to adaptively regulate mechanical parameters of the robot, based on the task requirements and external feedback. another important aspect of robot control in human-robot interaction/collaboration is the presence of the human. the human behaviour is usually highly unpredictable and difficult to model. indeed recent work at hri2<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_watch-3fv-3de3t5odke6-5fc-26feature-3dyoutu.be&d=dqifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=lndfq6bmdittidq4hi0did9pytxbdnomodgvyomlr5a&s=g4cbtsmsu6mc2gaghxgf6fjznc0b0h6nzehaiirh1pi&e= > laboratory aims at developing appropriate human-robot interfaces to enable the robot to predict or extract the human intention from various feedback modalities (human motor behaviour, vision, interaction force, voice commands, etc.). in addition, other key aspects such as role-allocation in human-robot cooperation and partner's skill evaluation, which can enable the robot to adapt its behaviour to accommodate for different level of competence and capability of the human will be explored. theme-2: design and control principles for power augmentation devices (tutors: dr. wansoo kim and dr. arash ajoudani) exoskeletons are wearable robotic devices that are used for human body power augmentation or rehabilitation. such mechanism could prove indispensable in addressing problems of injuries and growing elderly population. as the exoskeleton is attached to the human body, it is imperative that appropriate control methods and human-robot interfaces are developed to enable coordinated motion and assistance in the complex daily tasks. the main objective in this research line is the development of appropriate control strategies to facilitate the interaction between the human, the power augmentation device and the environment. in addition, hri2 aim at developing novel power augmentation devices, therefore, we highly encourage applications for hardware developments as well. theme-3: shared authority approaches in humanoids control (tutor: dr. arash ajoudani) the need to manipulate objects and tools in unstructured or hostile environments has led to the development of several master-slave teleoperation interfaces: from the most basic, unilateral position-based, to bilateral force-reflecting systems. notwithstanding the widespread use of such frameworks, they are known to lack substantial requirements to render an appropriate interaction performance (e.g. soft interactions in unilateral and stability in the latter). therefore, the main objective of this theme is to address such limitations by the development of novel and intuitive interfaces for the execution of dynamic remote manipulation tasks. our objective is to extend the recent developments at hri2

396,2017,"phd openings in biomechatronics lab.  ozyegin university, istanbul turkey"," biomechatronics laboratory in ozyegin university, istanbul has 3 funded phd openings with a start in fall (september) 2017 for those who have profound interest in both fundamental and applied robotics research. we are looking for highly motivated candidates with an msc in appropriate engineering disciplines. candidates should be willing to play leading key roles in the following high-risk high pay-off projects. project 1: comrade: a *co*llaborative *m*obile *r*obot *a*rm that learns impe*d*anc*e* critical tasks from humans funded by: eu h2020 msca project info: currently, fixed base industrial robot arms are extensively employed in factories. although these systems perform given tasks in an agile and dexterous manner, they only operate in robot-specific special environments where the robots are statically placed in a caged cell and continuously repeat carefully pre-engineered actions. as expected, they remain stationary for decades and cannot be easily reconfigurable; thus, decreasing the degree of transformability in production lines. considering the fact that industrial manufacturing experiences a paradigm shift from mass production to mass customization, current-day factories must improve the reconfigurability aspect of automated manufacturing lines. in response to this matter, the 4th industry revolution, industry 4.0, dictates the use of multi-tasking non-stationary robots which should safely work in human environments that require no robot-specific arrangements. it is also anticipated that the robot must possess cognitive abilities so as to learn certain tasks from humans with no engineering expertise. research theme [eu1]: whole-body motion control of a mobile manipulator: appropriate candidate background:  master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the student will be implementing whole body motion control techniques (e.g. [1]) that synergistically combine the omni-wheeled mobile base motion with the multi-dof manipulator (ur-3), while the robot tool is physically interacting with the environment. the robot should be able to mechanically transparent (zero-impedance) [2] for interference-free human-robot physical interaction. research theme [eu2]: human-to-robot skill transfer for the impedance-critic task execution appropriate candidate background: master degree in computer science, strong background in machine learning, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. knowledge on fundamentals of robot manipulators is a plus. the student will develop new algorithms that enables a mobile manipulator to effectively learn impedance critical tasks (drilling, screwing, etc.) by means of physical interactions with a human and acquire human?s abilities via human-to-robot skill transfer for subsequent autonomous task execution [3]. human-in-the-loop robot learning will be key to this phd theme. -- project 2: development of a self-balancing and physically compliant lower body exoskeleton robot for 3d walking support funded by: tubitak (scientific and technological research council of turkey) info: the purpose of this project is to design and implement a new generation lower body exoskeleton robot that could be used to provide robot-aided walking support for those who suffer paraplegia or similar pathological lower body diseases. in line with this purpose, the main objective of this project is to develop and synergistically integrate new technologies for a novel lower body exoskeleton robot that has advanced capabilities, such as, providing 3d walking support with no auxiliary tools, active self-balancing, and possessing competent actuator units. research theme [tr1]: motion planning and real-time controller synthesis for the exoskeleton-supported paraplegia walking appropriate candidate background: master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the state-of-the-art exoskeletons mostly actuate hip and knee joints through flexion/extension; therefore, the users must actively engage their upper body via crutches to maintain balance. recently, a self-balancing exoskeleton system (xor) was developed [4]. thus, this project will follow the footsteps of xor project, and pave the way for next generation lower body exoskeletons. -- general info: the research environment requires mastering the english language in writing, speaking and reading. gradually increasing turkish language ability will make your life more enjoyable in istanbul, but not required. biomechatronics lab. @ ?z?

candidates with an msc in electrical/mechanical/control engineering. robots are expected to help us in various tasks, some of which require collaborative effort to be successfully completed. to achieve a seamless and intuitive interaction, the robot must be able to physically interact with the human counterpart and predict the intentions of the human, despite the additional interaction with the uncertain and unpredictable environment. appropriate robot control methods therefore are essential for the robot to deal with various uncertainties, dynamically aspects and complex task requirements. a promising direction towards this goal is to adaptively regulate mechanical parameters of the robot, based on the task requirements and external feedback. another important aspect of robot control in human-robot interaction/collaboration is the presence of the human. the human behaviour is usually highly unpredictable and difficult to model. indeed, recent work at hri2 lab

(like humans), thereby engaging in cooperative behaviors.  presently, while emerging trends in neurosciences like the discovery of the default mode network [2,3], action observation network [4,5] are revolutionizing our understanding of the cortical basis of social intelligence, the underlying mechanistic/computational mechanisms  remain challenging research topics. the aim of this project is to address the objectives of robocom++ and to provide computational processes that allow us to ?perceive, act and remember? and to recycle them in order to simulate the perspective of others. in other words we aim at developing mechanisms that allow us to reuse our own episodic experiences to adopt the viewpoint of the other by analogy. the phd program will comprise at least one of the following research topics: ? to represent and simulate other?s actions in humanoid robots ? to develop reciprocal recognition of agency in hri ? to enable perspective taking from episodic memory in humanoid robots ? to integrate embodied social intelligence in a framework of cognitive reasoning. ? to validate humanoid social behaviour in ecological context requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving, c++ programming. a background on machine learning is an asset.? references 1. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__sssa.bioroboticsinstitute.it_news_robocomplusplus&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=jjzmtbakvidrgmd6bzjrpop2dwpyoplnnvhpgag2yvy&s=_zdm9faav74nvbrcc61lypkve9j-ajfb_vagiuwerzc&e=  2. mohan v, sandini g, morasso p.

) both headed by prof. bruno   siciliano at university of naples federico ii in italy, are seeking to   recruit senior postdoctoral research fellows that will have a key   research role in the following area: robotic manipulation focused on   prehensile manipulation of rigid and non-rigid objects.  the   successful candidates will conduct their research within the musha   project (www.musha.unina.it). ** description the candidate will develop learning and control algorithms for   rigid/deformable objects grasping and manipulation with   anthropomorphic hands using visual feedback. one challenge is to   recognize rigid objects, another challenge is to track and model   deformable objects. finally, a further challenge is to merge vision   and touch information to integrate them in reasoning to execute   complex manipulation tasks. the observation of the human behaviour   during the execution of a task is aimed at learning how vision and   touch information are integrated and used for hand-arm impedance   modulation, contact force regulation and sensory-motor coordination. **  we are looking for highly-motivated young scientists with a   background and phd in automatic control and/or robotics, preferably   with at least two years of experience abroad, and a well-established   publication record. desired qualifications include: -competencies in computer vision and machine learning; - sound background and working experience robotic manipulation/control   system design; - competencies in numerical modeling and simulation of rigid and   deformable systems - experience programming (c/c++, ros) and matlab - excellent publication record - creativity and proactive attitude - fluency in both spoken and written english - strong team player ** project idea musha aims at creating future generations of bio-inspired tools for   surgery and advanced bio-aware manipulation paradigms toward   breakthrough mini-invasive surgical instruments for organs   manipulation and android robotic hands. bio-inspired mechanical design   will address the reduction of tools weight and dimension by limiting   the number of actuators while preserving dexterity and manipulation   capabilities. fiber optic sensor will be suitably integrated to   measure the contact forces exchanged with the environment. the project   aims at designing an underactuated and sensorized three-fingered hand   to be used as a surgical tool for manipulation.  but the learning and   control strategies that musha is willing to develop are of interest   also for anthropomorphic hands. besides innovative control design,   musha  will develop an integrated framework merging vision and touch   information in reasoning to carry out complex manipulation tasks.  the   innovation will be linked not only to the mechanical design and   integrated sensor systems but also to novel planning and control   algorithms generating intelligent and effective actions. musha will   integrate contributions from: surgeons, on surgical tool requirements   definition and on testing in mechanical simulators and surgical   settings; electronic engineers, on the development, design and   integration of fiber optic sensors; robotic engineers, on mechanical   design, on vison-force control development from the observation of   human sensory-motor coordination and on testing robotic manipulation.   the synergy of the different competences is the key point to   accomplish musha objectives. ** motivation musha arises from the need to replicate human manipulation   capabilities in various fields where robotics can help to improve   life. this includes unstructured environments in which a humanoid   robot must replace the human being or parts of the body to address   daily-life tasks, but also minimally invasive robotic surgery where   the surgeon is unable to use hands to manipulate organs and tissues   while feeling its anatomy, consistency and temperature. in both cases,   the lack of knowledge on object or tissue textures, due to missing   tactile information, entails a loss of performance in task execution   as well as wrong decisions.  this research field is of worldwide   interest for several reasons. many objects we manipulate during our   daily activities cannot be considered rigid from the manipulation   point of view. this is the case of products with soft packets that can   be found, e.g., in a supermarket or in the case of manipulation of   textiles and clothes. furthermore, especially in the surgical   scenario, the manipulated tissues and organs are non-rigid and have   different consistency and texture. **about prisma lab university of naples federico ii is the third oldest university in   italy and the oldest public university in europe. the school of   engineering, with a population of 10,000 students, is the oldest in   italy and recently celebrated its second centennial since the   foundation by king gioacchino murat in 1811. the prisma team operates   in the department of electrical engineering and information   technology, where since almost 30 years is conducting research in   robotics. current interests include force control, visual servoing,   dual-arm/hand manipulation, human-robot interaction, service robotics,   and aerial robotics. the team has gained world-wide recognition and is   currently engaged in six projects supported by the european community.   see www.prisma.unina.it for further information. ** about icaros center the icaros center (interdepartmental center for advances in robotic   surgery) of the university of naples federico ii was founded in march   2016 by the will of prof. vincenzo mirone of the school of medicine   and surgery and prof. bruno siciliano of the school of

) both headed by prof. bruno   siciliano at university of naples federico ii in italy, are seeking to   recruit senior postdoctoral research fellows that will have a key   research role in the following area: robotic manipulation focused on   prehensile manipulation of rigid and non-rigid objects.  the   successful candidates will conduct their research within the musha   project (www.musha.unina.it). ** description the candidate will develop learning and control algorithms for   rigid/deformable objects grasping and manipulation with   anthropomorphic hands using visual feedback. one challenge is to   recognize rigid objects, another challenge is to track and model   deformable objects. finally, a further challenge is to merge vision   and touch information to integrate them in reasoning to execute   complex manipulation tasks. the observation of the human behaviour   during the execution of a task is aimed at learning how vision and   touch information are integrated and used for hand-arm impedance   modulation, contact force regulation and sensory-motor coordination. **  we are looking for highly-motivated young scientists with a   background and phd in automatic control and/or robotics, preferably   with at least two years of experience abroad, and a well-established   publication record. desired qualifications include: -competencies in computer vision and machine learning; - sound background and working experience robotic manipulation/control   system design; - competencies in numerical modeling and simulation of rigid and   deformable systems - experience programming (c/c++, ros) and matlab - excellent publication record - creativity and proactive attitude - fluency in both spoken and written english - strong team player ** project idea musha aims at creating future generations of bio-inspired tools for   surgery and advanced bio-aware manipulation paradigms toward   breakthrough mini-invasive surgical instruments for organs   manipulation and android robotic hands. bio-inspired mechanical design   will address the reduction of tools weight and dimension by limiting   the number of actuators while preserving dexterity and manipulation   capabilities. fiber optic sensor will be suitably integrated to   measure the contact forces exchanged with the environment. the project   aims at designing an underactuated and sensorized three-fingered hand   to be used as a surgical tool for manipulation.  but the learning and   control strategies that musha is willing to develop are of interest   also for anthropomorphic hands. besides innovative control design,   musha  will develop an integrated framework merging vision and touch   information in reasoning to carry out complex manipulation tasks.  the   innovation will be linked not only to the mechanical design and   integrated sensor systems but also to novel planning and control   algorithms generating intelligent and effective actions. musha will   integrate contributions from: surgeons, on surgical tool requirements   definition and on testing in mechanical simulators and surgical   settings; electronic engineers, on the development, design and   integration of fiber optic sensors; robotic engineers, on mechanical   design, on vison-force control development from the observation of   human sensory-motor coordination and on testing robotic manipulation.   the synergy of the different competences is the key point to   accomplish musha objectives. ** motivation musha arises from the need to replicate human manipulation   capabilities in various fields where robotics can help to improve   life. this includes unstructured environments in which a humanoid   robot must replace the human being or parts of the body to address   daily-life tasks, but also minimally invasive robotic surgery where   the surgeon is unable to use hands to manipulate organs and tissues   while feeling its anatomy, consistency and temperature. in both cases,   the lack of knowledge on object or tissue textures, due to missing   tactile information, entails a loss of performance in task execution   as well as wrong decisions.  this research field is of worldwide   interest for several reasons. many objects we manipulate during our   daily activities cannot be considered rigid from the manipulation   point of view. this is the case of products with soft packets that can   be found, e.g., in a supermarket or in the case of manipulation of   textiles and clothes. furthermore, especially in the surgical   scenario, the manipulated tissues and organs are non-rigid and have   different consistency and texture. **about prisma lab university of naples federico ii is the third oldest university in   italy and the oldest public university in europe. the school of   engineering, with a population of 10,000 students, is the oldest in   italy and recently celebrated its second centennial since the   foundation by king gioacchino murat in

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ suggested phd themes: theme-1: optimization of human-demonstrated skill for flexible human-robot interaction/collaboration supervisors: dr. luka peternel and dr. arash ajoudani the ability of robots to learn new skills and tasks is one of the main requirements for effective integration of robots in our daily lives. a particularity important scenario that can benefit from this aspect is physical human-robot interaction and collaboration, since the robot can obtain part of the skills through a direct human demonstration. however, the robots have different kinematic and dynamical structures compared to humans and therefore directly imitating the human demonstrated skill might not achieve optimal performances on the robot. a promising direction to improve the initially obtained skill for the given conditions can be based on the reinforcement learning techniques. the research in this phd theme is aimed to go beyond the current state-of-the-art methods developed at hrii lab (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__hri.iit.it_videos&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=kbhop5eg_p8jj_kqwhhivzbo0fs4-8bg41qwlepazua&s=6nmxzfcamqc__bgtjeha64cmh5f-uscdpyi7ctrdlgs&e= ). the goal is to develop novel methods that can improve, optimize and even exceed the existing robotic skill (initially obtained from human, or programmed) in online manner for any specific robot task involving complex physical interaction with the human and the environment. the developed methods will be specialized for physical interaction tasks and will be based on hybrid machine learning and optimization techniques. the study will be conducted on our robotic platforms, such as: walk-man and coman humanoid robots, centauro dual arm robot, kuka lwr, etc., while interaction and collaborating with humans. the candidates are expected to hold master's degree in robotics or computer science. good programming skill is required (at least c++ and matlab). ideally, the candidate should have experience or background in machine learning. theme-2: motor principles in human leg stiffness adaptation: application to robot movement control supervisors: dr. virginia ruiz and dr. arash ajoudani understanding human locomotion is a compelling topic when designing and controlling legged robots. humanoids, prosthesis, and exoskeletons are intended to move in uncertain environments designed for humans. however, most of such systems have been mainly designed for walking, and encounter limitations when performing dynamic tasks like sitting down, running, or jumping. moreover, they face numerous problems when placed in realistic environments with irregular terrains, stones on the path, wet surfaces, etc. on the other hand, humans easily deal with all these possible situations efficiently. our body has developed several mechanisms that simplify the control of interaction with the external world. one of these mechanisms is the adaptation of the leg joint stiffness. for instance, in case of surface irregularities, the modification of the leg stiffness simplifies the difficult task of foot placement. also, performing different tasks may require different stiffness: e.g., joints should be more compliant when landing from a jump, whereas they should be stiffer when propelling upstairs. therefore, in order to improve the design of robotic leg controllers, such that they are able to cope with all daily-life activities and environments, we first need to understand the human adaptation mechanisms. the proposed research will consist on two different aspects. the main one will be to understand the principles regulating the human leg stiffness in various dynamic scenarios such as walking, running, jumping, etc. for doing so, human movements in different environments and performing different tasks will be studied. sensory devices like motion capture and electromyography (emg) systems will be used for this purpose.  additionally, human energy efficiency during locomotion will be studied to develop a unified performance index that serves as a reference. the above achievements will define the underlying principles of human-like stiffness adaptation. a model will be then built to validate these principles for different tasks and conditions. this will be transferred to a controller to be tested in the existing humanoid robots and exoskeletons. the ideal candidate should hold a master degree in control engineering, biomechanics, robotics or a related field. good experience in simulation software and programming skills (e.g. matlab, python, c++) are required. knowledge about human biomechanics would be an advantage. theme-3: novel actuation/feedback mechanisms for wearable systems supervisors: dr. wansoo kim, dr. lorenzo masia, and dr. arash ajoudani wearable robotic devices are intended for human body power augmentation or rehabilitation. such mechanisms could be indispensable in addressing problems of injuries and growing elderly population. similarly, wearable haptic devices with same technology as the exoskeleton devices can be developed for interacting with a tele-operated robot. as the device is attached to the human body, it is imperative that an appropriate mechanism, control methods, and human-robot interfaces are developed to enable coordinated motion and assistance in the complex daily tasks. however, many conventional exoskeleton devices face problems in terms of usability. for example, although a rigid type exoskeleton may achieve a certain compliance profile in specific joints of a wearer, it's usually uncomfortable due to the inherent rigid, bulky mechanical structure and the mobility constraints of the device. a soft type exoskeleton can potentially address such mechanical limitations, but it will encounter limitations in transferring power from any area of the body to the ground. in order to compensate for the limitations of the conventional exoskeleton devices and successfully implement in the assistive exoskeleton and/or haptic device in human-robot physical interaction, a novel actuation principle, i.e. light-weight, low-resistance wearable mechanism, and controllable joint torque technologies are required. hence the objective in this research is to understand better the human joint mechanism and to develop novel actuation methods a hybrid (soft and rigid) structure. the successful candidates must have a master degree in mechanical engineering, robotics or a related field. good experience in mechanical design (including mechanism design, kinematics and dynamics, mechanics and optimization) and simulation software (e.g. solidworks, proe, matlab, autocad, catia, etc) is required. a background in human-robot interaction will be an advantage."

*division:* motor learning, assistive and rehabilitation robotics *description:* a great majority of neurological patients present both motor dysfunctions and impairments in kinesthesia, but traditional robot and virtual reality training techniques focus either in recovering motor functions or in assessing proprioceptive deficits. the open challenge is to implement effective and reliable assessment and training protocols for  sensorimotor recovery that exploit the interaction capabilities of the robots. in order to do it the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor deficits have to be studied from a computational point of view and translated into control algorithms in rehabilitation robots. the research will involve experiments with human subjects (children and adults - healthy and impaired) using haptic interfaces, analysis of movements and their neural correlates (using emg, eeg, tms). the knowledge gained from the experiments will be also used to design more effective haptic systems to be delivered directly to clinicians. this will imply a real push of the prototypes improved during the research period toward products and the concrete transfer of them in the clinical environment. the clinical experimental activities will be carried out inside major hospitals where iit has formalized collaborations. *requirements:* a master degree in bioengineering, computer science or equivalent, with experience in the analysis and modeling of human movements and in robot programming. attitude for experimental work, problem solving and computational modeling will constitute factors of preference. *references:* 1. de santis d, zenzeri j, casadio m, masia l, riva a, morasso p and squeri v (2015) robot-assisted training of the kinesthetic sense: enhancing

*division:* motor learning, assistive and rehabilitation robotics *description:* in the last decade there has been a growing interest in studying physical coupling between humans or humans and machines. indeed, developing a machine capable of understanding the intention of a movement and interactively cooperate with a human is among the frontiers of the research in robotics as well as rehabilitation and vocational training. in the last cited field the focus is on the motor skill transfer from an expert human agent to a na?ve one in a dyadic configuration [1]. the main idea behind the phd project is to pass from a dyadic configuration to a triadic one where two human exchange haptic information mediated by a robot that play an active role. the objective of the robot is to convey and shape the haptic information coming from the expert human to the na?ve one maximizing the learning process [2]. the research will involve experiments with human subjects (healthy and impaired) using haptic interfaces, mathematical modeling of human control strategies and design of more effective robots able to effectively transfer skills. *requirements:* a master degree in

*division:* motor learning, assistive and rehabilitation robotics & cognitive robotics and human-human interaction *description:* in the recent years many studies focused on how to optimize human-robot collaboration tasks. here we focus on a fundamental case where a human agent has to  learn how to use a tool while collaborating with an expert humanoid robot agent which, in this case, plays the active role of maximizing the learning of the human. in this new  perspective the process will proceed in two steps: 1) the humanoid robot acquire the knowledge of the collaborative tasks and becomes the ?robot teacher? by interacting (through the tool) with an expert human; 2) the na?ve human interact (through the tool) with the ?robot teacher? in order to learn the task in an optimal way. behavioral  experiments on motor learning will be conducted using haptic interfaces to study motor control mechanisms and how motor control strategies emerge during the interaction with specific set of tools. this activity is based on recent studies on dyadic interaction [1-2] and will contribute to define human inspired models of interaction. the model is transferred to the humanoid agent to acquire the human expert knowledge (in step 1) and to teach it to the na?ve one (in step 2). behavioral experiments will then be conducted with the humanoid robot icub to implement real use cases. in this context, the proactive role of the icub will enrich existing cognitive framework for human robot interaction. the  candidate will also exploit measure of engagement in the task (attentional level, cognitive load and fatigue). *requirements:* a master degree in bioengineering, computer science or equivalent, with experience in the analysis and modeling of human movements and in robot

actions and to decode their intentions, needs and emotions. view-invariance will be one of the crucial aspects of the system. additionally, these movement features will guide the selection of the appropriate robot behavior, to make it intuitively predictable and legible to the partner. robot motion planning could leverage existing tools to design biologically plausible robot movements for the icub.  requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving, c++ programming. a background on computer vision and machine learning is an asset.  references  1. sciutti a., mara m., tagliasco v., sandini g. 2018 humanizing human-robot interaction: on the importance of mutual understanding, ieee technology and society magazine https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__ieeexplore.ieee.org_document_8307144_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=ynxjsyhodzcun4pswpuidqhluh-l-oxnmtaon8w2eiq&s=uil4_grhnwzxhtlngbgd-rzbvshidz8z0p2x_p_gzc8&e= 2. sciutti a. & sandini g. 2017 , ?interacting with robots to investigate the bases of social interaction?, ieee transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering, 10.1109/tnsre.2017.2753879 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__ieeexplore.ieee.org_document_8068256_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=ynxjsyhodzcun4pswpuidqhluh-l-oxnmtaon8w2eiq&s=hqnjkjmmrneyroumnjvbonncdp-jbfnvrup_fthgnv8&e=  3. vignolo a., noceti n., rea f., sciutti a., odone f. & sandini g. 2017, ?detecting biological motion for human-robot interaction: a link between perception and action?, frontiers in robotics and ai, 4. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__journal.frontiersin.org_article_10.3389_frobt.2017.00014_full&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=ynxjsyhodzcun4pswpuidqhluh-l-oxnmtaon8w2eiq&s=s1uva5yikwcvtklgmfaxlkmttuwrhc1cayphdjr8cfk&e=  4. sandini g., sciutti a. & rea f.

actions and to decode their intentions, needs and emotions. view-invariance will be one of the crucial aspects of the system. additionally, these movement features will guide the selection of the appropriate robot behavior, to make it intuitively predictable and legible to the partner. robot motion planning could leverage existing tools to design biologically plausible robot movements for the icub. requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving, c++ programming. a background on computer vision and machine learning is an asset. references 1. sciutti a., mara m., tagliasco v., sandini g. 2018 humanizing human-robot interaction: on the importance of mutual understanding, ieee technology and society magazine https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__ieeexplore.ieee.org_document_8307144_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=a3cv45vj45cv3pqpp68kwx0evpudli2tmufn75i52be&s=atjegbficm-ncrgmzmhfufr8rgyforceayis95u1p5u&e= 2. sciutti a. & sandini g. 2017 , ?interacting with robots to investigate the bases of social interaction?, ieee transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering, 10.1109/tnsre.2017.2753879 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__ieeexplore.ieee.org_document_8068256_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=a3cv45vj45cv3pqpp68kwx0evpudli2tmufn75i52be&s=efxvxaahbg1kdvn-dvlp0xp5qgvjcn9rpro_w7k7fuu&e= 3. vignolo a., noceti n., rea f., sciutti a., odone f. & sandini g. 2017, ?detecting biological motion for human-robot interaction: a link between perception and action?, frontiers in robotics and ai, 4. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__journal.frontiersin.org_article_10.3389_frobt.2017.00014_full&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=a3cv45vj45cv3pqpp68kwx0evpudli2tmufn75i52be&s=9w0pjbxibga-gfqt2o_ftcrg__j11dxnjz9vnhtu8tk&e= 4. sandini g., sciutti a. & rea f.

prostheses). these typically employ inertial sensors, force sensors and encoders to estimate the configuration of the user during gait and activity being performed, and use this information to control the mechanical impedance of the joint. active prostheses are similarly feedback controlled, but also provide an active power boost/assist to the patient for tasks which otherwise would be difficult or impossible. thus, the control algorithm must detect the patient?s activity and phase of gait, and appropriately modulate actuator power to execute a diverse range of tasks. control design that satisfies the expectations and needs of the patient will be a key differentiating factor for advanced prostheses, and will drive adoption of the product over competitors in the market. we also believe that achieving the goals of safety, predictability, naturalness (biomimicry) and personalization will require a comprehensive integration of the fields of human-machine interaction (hmi), and control system design. this could lead to improvements in, for example, prosthesis functionalities (e.g. by reducing the articular stress of the user/prosthesis, and by realizing biomechanics that can mimic that of a healthy subject). the aim of this project is to develop novel control architectures and control strategies to display required volitional and reflex behavior with the characteristics of safety/robustness, fluidity, predictability, and reduced training time for the patients. these algorithms are to be tested on the range of prosthetic prototypes based on novel technologies we are currently developing in-house. this will contribute to the technical progress of the iit experimental prosthetic devices, which will be evaluated by means of bench tests, biomechanical prototypes, and tested on amputee patients. the project will be carried out at the rehab technologies lab of iit. it will be a technological challenge in which the rehab technologies team will share resources, competencies and motivation to achieve excellent results transferable to the medical field. we are looking for a highly motivated, outstanding candidate with the following profile: - a solid background in controls/biomedical/mechatronic engineering, with focus on locomotion control - phd in related field - publication record showing evidence of strong expertise in the field, or relevant industrial experience during this period, the postdoctoral researcher will develop the following skills and experience: - autonomously analyze the control requirements of complex prosthetic devices during gait and other non-cyclical activities. - develop practical control architectures and strategies to implement control designs - work in a real-world scenario by operating with both engineers and clinicians - develop a solid background in medical and prosthetic devices to apply, please send your cv, publication list, cover letter and at least one reference to matteo.laffranchi at iit.it<mailto:matteo.laffranchi at iit.it>  keeping giovanni.milandri at iit.it<mailto:giovanni.milandri at iit.it> in cc., using ?post-doc application ?

prostheses). these typically use inertial sensors, force sensors and encoders to estimate the configuration of the user during gait and activity being performed, and use this information to control the mechanical impedance of the joint. active prostheses are similarly feedback controlled, but also provide an active power boost/assist to the patient for tasks which otherwise would be difficult or impossible. thus, the control algorithm must detect the patient?s activity and phase of gait, and appropriately modulate actuator power to execute a diverse range of tasks. control design that satisfies the expectations and needs of the patient will be a key differentiating factor for advanced prostheses, we also believe that achieving the goals of safety, predictability, naturalness (biomimicry) and personalization will require a comprehensive integration of the fields of human-machine interaction (hmi), and control system design. this could lead to improvements in, for example, prosthesis functionalities (e.g. by reducing the articular stress of the user/prosthesis, and by realizing biomechanics that can mimic that of a healthy subject). the aim of this project is to develop novel control architectures and control strategies to display required volitional and reflex behavior with the characteristics of safety/robustness, fluidity, predictability, and reduced training time for the patients. these algorithms are going to be tested on the range of prosthetic prototypes based on novel active and semi-active technologies we are currently developing in-house. this will contribute to the technical progress of the iit experimental prosthetic devices, which will be evaluated by means of bench tests, biomechanical prototypes, and tested on amputee patients. the project will be carried out at the rehab technologies lab of iit. it will be a technological challenge in which the rehab technologies team will share resources, competencies and motivation to achieve excellent results transferable to the medical field. we are looking for a highly motivated, outstanding candidate with the following profile: - a solid background in controls/biomedical/mechatronic engineering, with focus on locomotion control - phd in related field - publication record showing evidence of strong expertise in the field, or relevant industrial experience during this period, the postdoctoral researcher will develop the following skills and experience: - autonomously analyze the control requirements of complex prosthetic devices during gait and other non-cyclical activities. - develop practical control architectures and strategies to implement control designs - work in a real-world scenario by operating with both engineers and clinicians - develop a solid background in medical and prosthetic devices to apply, please send your cv, publication list, cover letter and at least one reference to matteo.laffranchi at iit.it<mailto:matteo.laffranchi at iit.it>  keeping giovanni.milandri at iit.it<mailto:giovanni.milandri at iit.it> in cc., using ?post-doc application ?

prostheses). these typically use inertial sensors, force sensors and encoders to estimate the configuration of the user during gait and activity being performed, and use this information to control the mechanical impedance of the joint. active prostheses are similarly feedback controlled, but also provide an active power boost/assist to the patient for tasks which otherwise would be difficult or impossible. thus, the control algorithm must detect the patient?s activity and phase of gait, and appropriately modulate actuator power to execute a diverse range of tasks. control design that satisfies the expectations and needs of the patient will be a key differentiating factor for advanced prostheses, we also believe that achieving the goals of safety, predictability, naturalness (biomimicry) and personalization will require a comprehensive integration of the fields of human-machine interaction (hmi), and control system design. this could lead to improvements in, for example, prosthesis functionalities (e.g. by reducing the articular stress of the user/prosthesis, and by realizing biomechanics that can mimic that of a healthy subject). the aim of this project is to develop novel control architectures and control strategies to display required volitional and reflex behavior with the characteristics of safety/robustness, fluidity, predictability, and reduced training time for the patients. these algorithms are going to be tested on the range of prosthetic prototypes based on novel active and semi-active technologies we are currently developing in-house. this will contribute to the technical progress of the iit experimental prosthetic devices, which will be evaluated by means of bench tests, biomechanical prototypes, and tested on amputee patients. the project will be carried out at the rehab technologies lab of iit. it will be a technological challenge in which the rehab technologies team will share resources, competencies and motivation to achieve excellent results transferable to the medical field. we are looking for a highly motivated, outstanding candidate with the following profile: - a solid background in controls/biomedical/mechatronic engineering, with focus on locomotion control - phd in related field - publication record showing evidence of strong expertise in the field, or relevant industrial experience during this period, the postdoctoral researcher will develop the following skills and experience: - autonomously analyze the control requirements of complex prosthetic devices during gait and other non-cyclical activities. - develop practical control architectures and strategies to implement control designs - work in a real-world scenario by operating with both engineers and clinicians - develop a solid background in medical and prosthetic devices to apply, please send your cv, publication list, cover letter and at least one reference to matteo.laffranchi at iit.it<mailto:matteo.laffranchi at iit.it>  keeping giovanni.milandri at iit.it<mailto:giovanni.milandri at iit.it> in cc., using ?post-doc application ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- theme 1: dynamics-aware human models for ergonomic human-robot collaboration musculoskeletal disorders are the single largest category of work-related diseases in many industrial countries, and are associated with very large costs in lost productivity and absenteeism due to sickness. in high-volume production facilities, large parts of the workstation should ideally be adapted to the workers to prevent such injuries. however, in smaller production lines, especially found in small and medium enterprises, the regular adaptation of the entire workstation due to the high flexibility needs is a major challenge. a solution to the problem is the development of reconfigurable human-robot collaboration (hrc) workstations and frameworks. these are key to enable agile manufacturing by merging human dexterity, flexibility and problem-solving ability with robotics strength and precision. in this direction, this phd theme aims to create a framework that enables real-time adaptation to human dynamic factors and intentions. the focus will be on the development of real-time human dynamic models to track dynamic states and human ergonomic factors. consequently, robot responses will be formed to assist the worker to perform the intended

is a resource to devise optimal behaviors which often require the robotic system to work in close proximity of kinematic and actuation limits (like in time-optimal control). for non-redundant systems moving in free space, several ad-hoc control paradigms exist, but it is reasonable to assume that more efficient techniques can be designed for redundant systems. the problem becomes even more complex when forces are exchanged between robots and/or with the environment, as when robots physically interact with a jointly manipulated object. we are keen to investigate hybrid optimal control/machine learning solutions to tackle this research issue with a motivated robotics enthusiast. position supervised by: prof. pasquale chiacchio
