maximization of the user's safety.
ucl is mainly in charge of the controller design. this work will be 
completed in collaboration with a postdoc and will require the design of 
an advanced controller, multibody, physics-oriented simulations of the 
user/device interactions, and experimental activities (both with healthy 
and impaired participants) carried out with the group of rehabilitation 
& physical medicine (institute of neuroscience) at ucl.

this work will be validated with a novel mechatronic device relying on a 
new type of sensory integration. both will be developed by our partners, 
such that strong interactions will be required during the whole project.

14,2017,"phd openings in biomechatronics lab.  ozyegin university, istanbul turkey"," biomechatronics laboratory in ozyegin university, istanbul has 3 funded phd openings with a start in fall (september) 2017 for those who have profound interest in both fundamental and applied robotics research. we are looking for highly motivated candidates with an msc in appropriate engineering disciplines. candidates should be willing to play leading key roles in the following high-risk high pay-off projects. project 1: comrade: a *co*llaborative *m*obile *r*obot *a*rm that learns impe*d*anc*e* critical tasks from humans funded by: eu h2020 msca project info: currently, fixed base industrial robot arms are extensively employed in factories. although these systems perform given tasks in an agile and dexterous manner, they only operate in robot-specific special environments where the robots are statically placed in a caged cell and continuously repeat carefully pre-engineered actions. as expected, they remain stationary for decades and cannot be easily reconfigurable; thus, decreasing the degree of transformability in production lines. considering the fact that industrial manufacturing experiences a paradigm shift from mass production to mass customization, current-day factories must improve the reconfigurability aspect of automated manufacturing lines. in response to this matter, the 4th industry revolution, industry 4.0, dictates the use of multi-tasking non-stationary robots which should safely work in human environments that require no robot-specific arrangements. it is also anticipated that the robot must possess cognitive abilities so as to learn certain tasks from humans with no engineering expertise. research theme [eu1]: whole-body motion control of a mobile manipulator: appropriate candidate background:  master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the student will be implementing whole body motion control techniques (e.g. [1]) that synergistically combine the omni-wheeled mobile base motion with the multi-dof manipulator (ur-3), while the robot tool is physically interacting with the environment. the robot should be able to mechanically transparent (zero-impedance) [2] for interference-free human-robot physical interaction. research theme [eu2]: human-to-robot skill transfer for the impedance-critic task execution appropriate candidate background: master degree in computer science, strong background in machine learning, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. knowledge on fundamentals of robot manipulators is a plus. the student will develop new algorithms that enables a mobile manipulator to effectively learn impedance critical tasks (drilling, screwing, etc.) by means of physical interactions with a human and acquire human?s abilities via human-to-robot skill transfer for subsequent autonomous task execution [3]. human-in-the-loop robot learning will be key to this phd theme. -- project 2: development of a self-balancing and physically compliant lower body exoskeleton robot for 3d walking support funded by: tubitak (scientific and technological research council of turkey) info: the purpose of this project is to design and implement a new generation lower body exoskeleton robot that could be used to provide robot-aided walking support for those who suffer paraplegia or similar pathological lower body diseases. in line with this purpose, the main objective of this project is to develop and synergistically integrate new technologies for a novel lower body exoskeleton robot that has advanced capabilities, such as, providing 3d walking support with no auxiliary tools, active self-balancing, and possessing competent actuator units. research theme [tr1]: motion planning and real-time controller synthesis for the exoskeleton-supported paraplegia walking appropriate candidate background: master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the state-of-the-art exoskeletons mostly actuate hip and knee joints through flexion/extension; therefore, the users must actively engage their upper body via crutches to maintain balance. recently, a self-balancing exoskeleton system (xor) was developed [4]. thus, this project will follow the footsteps of xor project, and pave the way for next generation lower body exoskeletons. -- general info: the research environment requires mastering the english language in writing, speaking and reading. gradually increasing turkish language ability will make your life more enjoyable in istanbul, but not required. biomechatronics lab. @ ?z?
