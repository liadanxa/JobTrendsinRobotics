arcaa invites applications for two phd positions with start on january 2012 or as soon as possible hereafter

and for a period of three years. the australian research centre for aerospace automation (arcaa)

aims to develop technologies that will allow the safe, reliable, and cost-effective operation of unmanned

aircraft systems (uas, also known as uavs) for scientific and civilian applications. arcaa is engaged

in different research areas including aerospace automation, flight control, static and dynamic sense and

avoid, 3d perception and guidance for various classes of uas. more than 30 researchers and engineers are

working on different projects and in multidisciplinary areas. arcaa offers access to state-of-the-art facilities

including small uas, autonomous helicopters, fixed-wing uas of different sizes, an optionally-piloted cessna aircraft,

and many other infrastructures for deployment and field testing. arcaa is a world-leading research centre

based in brisbane and has an excellent national and international reputation for high-quality theoretical and

experimental research funded by aerospace industry, government and other organizations. the details of the

research activities and projects within arcaa can be found at:

http://www.arcaa.aero/

http://research.ict.csiro.au/research/labs/autonomous-systems/field-robotics/field-robotics



project 1:  bio-inspired perception and guidance for unmanned aircraft systems

the goal of this exciting project is to investigate the challenging problem of vision-based 3d perception and guidance for autonomous aerial robots using a bio-inspired approach. the aim is to develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies that will allow small uas flying at low altitude to negotiate obstacles and to accomplish their missions in highly cluttered and dynamic environments. there are three main areas for study:



1. real-time 3d perception: development of a novel and new framework for robotics-oriented image processing and computer vision using a new generation of bio-inspired vision sensors such as artificial compound eyes and dynamic event-based cameras. the focus will be on the design of unconventional efficient and robust algorithms based on the ecological perception paradigm.



2. guidance system: this is mainly concerned with the development of guidance strategies for obstacle avoidance and path planning. two bio-inspired approaches will be investigated and compared. the first one is the insect-inspired method using optic flow, and the second one is based on the tau-theory which is originated from research on ecological psychology.



3. implementation and flight testing: the phd project will also involve the implementation of the proposed algorithms on aerial vehicles and evaluation of their performance through indoor and outdoor flight experiments.





project 2: aerial terrain relative navigation for pinpoint and safe landing of unmanned aircraft

the aim of the project is to develop and demonstrate a system that will enable unmanned aircraft to perform

non-gps accurate (pinpoint) and safe landing at a designated unprepared site. the proposed research will investigate

two different approaches: 1) adapt and apply the technologies developed by nasa jpl for spacecraft

landing on mars [1][2] for pinpoint landing of unmanned aircraft; and 2) attack the problem from a different

angle altogether, using the way birds and insects navigate to their goal as insight and inspiration. the work

involves:

- landmark extraction and topological-metric map building.

- landmark recognition and visual route/place cognition.

- absolute position estimation.

- visual odometry or path integration between mapped landmarks.

- real-time implementation of the developed algorithms and flight testing of the system using real unmanned aircraft.





in addition to these main research activities, phd students will be also involved in other projects and collaborative activities with other international universities and leading aerospace companies such as boeing and insitu pacific.





qualifications:

applicants should have completed a bachelor degree with first class honours or a master's degree in engineering, mathematics or computer science, and:

- be able to demonstrate knowledge within one of the following disciplines: mechatronics and/or robotics, avionics and/or aerospace, computer vision, electrical engineering.

project title
-------------
development of globally optimal solutions to simultaneous localization and mapping for robot navigation

project summary
---------------
robot navigation in unknown environments requires a robot to simultaneously construct a map in real-time and localize itself within the map, particularly in the absence of external location reference such as a global positioning system. the project will develop in-depth understanding of the fundamental structure and properties of nonlinearity involved in simultaneous localization and mapping (slam); efficient and reliable algorithm for solving very large scale slam problems; and reliable real time monocular slam algorithms. this will result in the development of robots that can reliably and continuously navigate in unknown
environments.

research subject

colorectal cancer has become a major healthcare problem with over 1 million
new cases diagnosed annually worldwide. there is an urgent need for new
early stage screening and detection systems that are both cost-effective
and patient friendly. the 5-year eu-funded codir project (http://codir.org/)
has been set up to address this problem through the development a novel
semi-autonomous robot for colonic investigation and early diagnosis. the
project is led by the eminent surgeon professor sir alfred cuschieri. the
objective is to create a patient-friendly system for inspection of the
colon, under the control of a clinician operating a robot.

the master’s research work aims to generate algorithmic solutions for
motion planning and control of semi-autonomous generic robot devices inside
hollow human organs.  the targeted environment is the colon, although this
could be extended to other organs as the objective is to generate adaptive
behaviors based on fluid and tissue interaction with the device, in which
low organ stiffness is a critical issue.

the methodology proposed is based on modeling and simulation of 3
dimensional deformable tissues in interaction with fluids (including
turbulent two phase fluid environments) and generic rigid body devices. the
first part would be boosted by collaboration with australia's national
science agency (csiro http://www.csiro.au/)  which will provide us with a
mechanically realistic simulation of the colon that is used for actual
colonoscopy training devices.  the models and simulations obtained will be
constantly validated and updated by experiments in physical phantoms of the
colon and thiel cadavers. these “mechanical models” are equipped with
sensors and linked to data acquisition systems and are under continuous
development by the codir team.

in the first semester the student will focus on the interaction between the
organ’s wall, the fluid and the generic robot, formulating and validating
an appropriate tool to host the generic motion algorithms.  in the
following semester the student will develop the motion planning and control
algorithms for this dynamic environment. the student will have access to
imsat and the university of dundee facilities in order to perform
experiments. these facilities include, amongst others, access to thiel
embalmed human cadavers and animal organs, a fully equipped mechanical
workshop and 3d prototyping printers. in addition, the student will use the
novel robots which are being developed for the codir project, in order to
test and validate his/her research work.

the potential of this research lies in the concept that improvements in
modeling and simulation can enable more accurate and robust pre- and
intra-operative planning. in addition, semi-autonomous devices that can
safely navigate and find their way inside dynamically changing environments
can increase the success rate of inherently uncertain surgical
(*e.g.*colonic) interventions.

imsat (http://www.imsat.org/) is a well-equipped research institute located
close to ninewells hospital, a major medical school in dundee, scotland.
the imsat staff in general, and the codir team in particular, enjoy a happy
and thriving research environment with good funding and many opportunities
for aspiring and talented students from all over the world.

165,2016,phd scholarship in augmented reality  indoor+outdoor tracking (hit lab nz)," project description the human interface technology lab new zealand (hit lab nz) at the university of canterbury in christchurch, nz has a fully funded scholarship for a phd student. the work will be closely advised by staff from the wireless research and spatial engineering research centres, so the ideal applicant will have experience and interest in wireless signal processing and/or computer vision. the work will involve research into methods for tracking a person?s position and orientation outside and inside of buildings. the work will focus on ways of combining various existing spatial localisation technologies (e.g., visual, inertial, transponder-based) with novel technologies in support of high-precision tracking. this work will be carried out as part of a multi-year project on applied research on improving ar tracking for mobile users in mixed-reality environments and for long-duration use. the successful applicant will join a multidisciplinary team from the hit lab nz, the wireless research centre (wrc), and the spatial engineering research centre (serc), all located in a single building at the university of canterbury, currently working on this problem. significant mentoring will be provided by senior academic staff, giving the applicant a solid foundation for work in industry and/or academia upon successful completion of the phd degree programme. results of the work will be submitted for publication in leading journal and conference venues, and there is budget for travel to present the work. qualifications the successful applicant must have completed a masters degree in a vr-related field, such as computer science or electrical engineering, and be qualified for entrance into the hit lab nz phd programme. unlike most us doctoral programs, phd degrees in new zealand are typically completed within three years, and do not involve coursework. students begin conducting research from the moment they start the programme. enrolment can start at any time, but we would like to finalise the scholarship by january 1, 2017. the hit lab nz, wrc, and serc the hit lab nz is one of the leading research labs focused on human-centred design of technology to support people in all facets of their lives. we put the person first, and then apply an appropriate mix of technology for that person in the context of the tasks they are doing. the lab is very international in flavour, and interdisciplinary in thought and approach. regular social activities organised by the lab create a casual rapport amongst the staff and students in the lab. the wireless research and spatial engineering research centres have expertise in several techniques to provide indoor and outdoor location information, such as spread-spectrum based wireless range-finding combined with map-constraints and inertial sensor data combined using kalman filtering techniques. both centres work closely with local and international industry, solving real-world industry research problems, ensuring graduates gain relevant skills and experience for their future careers. needless to say, new zealand provides an unbelievable setting to perform this work. christchurch is the prime spot to launch excursions around new zealand, as it has an international airport, and is in the middle of south island. this provides easy access to beaches, pristine forests with extensive, well-maintained walking and mountain-biking tracks, excellent skiing in winter, and easy connections to other locations such as australia. christchurch is also very family friendly. more information for more information or to submit your application, please see the following links: +email rob lindeman (gogo at

>  ntnu is  norway 's second largest university, with an annual budget of about us $800 million. its 51 departments are spread out over seven major faculties, and graduate about 3.300 students every year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

>  trondheim was  norway 's first capital city, founded more than 1.000 years ago, in 997 - but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

310,2019,"funded phd position in  ""miniaturisationof a novel friction-sensing tactile sensor"" at ucd,   ireland  (stephen redmond)"," online  ireland   position description: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__euraxess.ec.europa.eu_jobs_465425&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=xewhcynlrbpkxiih1fkt0tct1gtukr-jkeujvsikafm&e=  *phd in miniaturisation of a novel friction-sensing tactile sensor* *background:* prosthetic and robotic hands demonstrate poor dexterity during object manipulation, often dropping objects. humans rarely allow objects to slip because we can sense if an object is slippery and adjust our grip. this research program has three work packages: (wp1) to advance our understanding of how humans sense friction; (wp2) to demonstrate, using a number of friction-based tactile sensor prototypes currently under development by our research groups in dublin and sydney, that friction sensing leads to improved dexterity in robotic manipulation; *(wp3) to use advanced design, manufacturing, and instrumentation methods to miniaturise the proposed sensors to a scale similar to a human finger pad*. the outcomes of this research, which would endow artificial hands with the ability to feel the slipperiness and/or impending loss of grip of a grasped object, could significantly advance the fields of prosthetics, telesurgery, and service, agricultural, and manufacturing robotics. *phd scope:* the candidate will work on *wp3 of this project, refining and miniaturising the existing tactile sensor design concepts under development at ucd (dublin,  ireland ) and unsw (sydney, australia)*. see demo: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__youtu.be_ukqe-5fnobhjo&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=oyreem5u0sdds_6ulqz5q7rw1rvxep81qyo6eypoftc&e= . we have developed a novel optical technique to instrument silicone protrusions which resemble the papillae found in the skin of the human finger pad. we can measure forces and displacements with excellent accuracy (millinewtons and micrometres, respectively). creating a dense array of such protrusion allows us to approximate the biomechanics of the human pad, and possibly exceed its sensitivity; the human finger has an effective density of about 500 sensing elements across the finger pad. in addition to measuring contact forces, torques, vibration, and slip, the proposed design concept ultimately allows us to sense the friction of the contact without ever completely losing the grasp. *the candidate will miniaturise the proposed tactile sensor (robot finger pad) design using advanced sub-millimetre manufacturing techniques; by creating a dense array of deformable sensing elements, and by developing novel light generation and detection optoelectronic circuits which are both suitable for mass production and operate effectively at the proposed device dimensions. the candidate will demonstrate that this miniaturised design retains the ability to estimate friction from slip events on the periphery of the finger pad before complete loss of grip occurs.* *supervision and research environment:* the candidate will be supervised by *a/prof stephen redmond* (school of electrical and electronic engineering, ucd https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__people.ucd.ie_stephen.redmond&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=y7fg6kmyejqpen4yvwrtq4hxsaxypoa7gancfjc3i6w&e= ). the candidate will also collaborate with dr heba khamis at unsw (sydney, australia). the candidate will have an opportunity to contribute to the sfi insight centre for data analytics ( https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.insight-2dcentre.org_&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=fhvw2com1bfa2wuanmhnme0e97ablajtbx21gq64uiu&e= ) based at ucd. there are also ongoing commercialisation activities around this technology ( https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.contactile.com&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=b6bfmdukfuy2918rilrfbz-rmgwlriwyqub-wb9ecvy&e= ). *funding:* a *stipend of **?**18,500 per annum plus tuition fee is available for a maximum of four years*. the project is generously funded by science foundation  ireland ?s president of  ireland  future research leaders award, held by a/prof redmond, which includes an extensive budget for laboratory apparatus, consumables, and travel. both tactile sensor design work packages are also partly supported by us office of naval research global funding held by a/prof redmond and dr heba khamis at unsw (sydney, australia). *academic requirements:* the minimum academic qualification is a *first- or upper-second-class honours degree* (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, software engineering, computer engineering, mechanical or mechatronic engineering, biomedical engineering, robotics, or a related field which provides sufficient background in the skills required for the successful completion of this project. desirable skills include knowledge of, or experience with: *3d printers;
