phd fellowship

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional
