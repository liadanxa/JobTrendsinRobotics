application website: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten  

application deadline: september 21, 2012 (12 noon, italian time)

application requirements:

strongly-motivated candidates holding a master degree in computer science / engineering / mathematics or other related fields are invited to apply. applicants should ideally have a background in machine learning, robotics or human-robot interaction, with strong mathematical and computer programming skills (matlab, c++ or equivalent).

application procedure:

to apply please send a detailed cv, statement of motivation, bsc and msc transcripts, degree certificates and other support material such as reference letters to dr sylvain calinon (sylvain.calinon at iit.it). the applicants also need to fill the online application procedure from the university of genova: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten .


the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

phd fellowship

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phd position opening on:

*“haptic device design, development, and application to *

*rehabilitative training based on multimodal action observation”*

*
*

* *

there is currently an opening for a phd position in the robotics, brain,
and cognitive sciences department (rbcs) at the istituto italiano di
tecnologia (italian institute of technology, iit) to work on the
development of a novel tactile feedback device for enhancing stroke
rehabilitation.  the phd candidate will work directly with an international
and interdisciplinary team of researchers: dr alberto ansaldo, dr. michela
bassolino, dr. netta gurari, and grzegorz bubak.  iit is located in genoa,
italy with state-of-the-art laboratories and international collaborations
in the field of robotics, neuroscience, cognitive systems, and
nanotechnologies. the three years position is fully funded, with a start
date of january 2014, and international applications are encouraged.


the goal of this research path is to enhance the effectiveness of available
rehabilitative training methods for stroke patients with motor deficits by
using an intervention based on multimodal action observation. action
observation is defined as the process of observing an action being
performed by others. in the last few years, a growing body of evidence
supports the notion that patients with motor disorders may have an improved
rehabilitative experience if they use action observation in addition to the
currently available traditional physical therapy (e.g., ertelt et al.,
2007, *neuroimage*; small et al., 2010, *developmental psychobiology*;
franceschini et al., 2013, *neurorehabil neural repair*).

the phd candidate will investigate whether the addition of veridical
tactile stimulation to action observation can enhance the brain plasticity
over solely observing an action. the phd candidate will create prototype(s)
of tactile feedback device(s) for relaying artificial cutaneous information
to a human (e.g., skin stretch, vibration) using both readily available and
novel actuator technologies. the candidate will test the effectiveness of
these devices by using both behavioral and neurophysiological methods, such
as psychophysics testing and transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms). the
aim is to have a device finalized and ready for use in rehabilitative
treatment of stroke patients at the completion of the doctoral work.

this work will be conducted alongside an interdisciplinary team of
researchers, currently representing three unique research fields
(neuroscience, mechanical engineering/haptics, materials science) and three
different countries (italy, usa, poland). the applicant should be excited
to work in such a collaborative environment, and be possibly interested in
spending a portion of his/her time conducting research in the usa and/or
switzerland. ideally, we are looking for candidates who have a background
in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science,
electrical engineering, experimental psychology, or closely related fields.
participants should be motivated to develop a novel tactile feedback device
(with support from the *robotics, brain and cognitive sciences *department
staff), to program visual and haptic virtual environments, and to perform
human subject testing with the device. we are looking for applicants who
have a proficiency in both written and spoken english and who are excited
to pursue a career in conducting scientific research.
