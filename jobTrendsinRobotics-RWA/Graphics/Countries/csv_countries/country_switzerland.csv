open phd position announcement

artificial intelligence laboratory
university of zurich, switzerland

----------------------------------

one fully funded phd student position will be available from
1st of october, 2005 at the artificial intelligence laboratory,
university of zurich, switzerland (lab director: rolf pfeifer, project
leader: fumiya iida).

this is a position in a newly established project called ""from
locomotion to cognition"" funded by the swiss national science
foundation. the goal of the project is twofold: first, we want to make
inroads into the fundamental question of how the low-level dynamics
(such as dynamic legged locomotion) can be related to higher-level
cognitive or symbolic processes, or stated differently how cognition can
be “grounded” in embodiment. second, we will show that by providing an
appropriate framework to approach this philosophical issue, we can
actually design better robots. in this sense, we hope to make
theoretical contributions to artificial intelligence and cognitive
science, but also to make progress in very practical engineering terms.
for experimental work of this project, candidates are expected to have a
strong motivation in designing/building physical mechanical systems, and
basic programming skill for control, simulation and data analysis.

applicants should have a msc in one of the following disciplines (but
other areas are also possible):

* mechanical, electronic engineering and/or robotics
* physics, biology and/or biomechanics
* embodied cognitive science

proficiency in writing/spoken english is mandatory (preferably
native-level). phd students will be requested to do class assistance and
communicating with leading scientists world wide as a part of the job.

to apply for the position, please send a letter of motivation along with
a cv and two academic references to rolf pfeifer (pfeifer at ifi.unizh.ch).
for further information, please contact: fumiya iida (iida at ifi.unizh.ch).

deadline for applications: 30.11.2005
(we will close this call as soon as we fix the position.)

5,2006,two postdoc positions in biologically-inspired robotics at epfl,"dear colleagues,

i would be most grateful if you could transmit the add below for postdoc 
positions in my group at epfl to any of your phd students who might be 
interested.

many thanks,

auke ijspeert

the biologically inspired robotics group (birg, http://birg.epfl.ch/) in 
the school of computer and communication sciences at epfl (lausanne, 
switzerland) anticipates (95% sure) to have *two open postdoc 
positions*: one in modular robotics (position a), and the other in 
biologically inspired amphibious robotics and control of locomotion 
(position b).

*position a: modular robotics*

this position is part of a new project in collaboration with prof. aude 
billard and prof. pierre dillenbourg on the use of modular robots for 
creating adaptive furniture. the goal of the project is to design and 
control a set of robotic building blocks that can be used to generate 
robots capable of locomotion and reconfiguration. among other things, 
the robots should serve as adaptive furniture, i.e. stools/chairs/sofas 
capable of moving and changing shape. candidates need to have a phd 
degree related to robotics. the ideal candidate for this position should 
have a background in robotics, in particular in mechanical design and in 
control. good programming skills and a strong interest in human-computer 
interaction are also needed. the responsibility of the postdoc will be 
to help designing the physical modules (in particular the connection 
mechanisms) as well as to develop reconfiguration algorithms (with 
simulated robots, as well as real modules, such as the yamor modules). 
starting date: as soon as possible (e.g june 2006).

*position b: biologically inspired amphibious robotics and control of 
locomotion*

this position is part of a project which aims at constructing and 
controling amphibious robots with multiple degrees of freedom, and at 
using inspiration from biology, in particular the concept of central 
pattern generators (cpgs), for controling their locomotion. the type of 
robots we envision are snake and salamander-like robots, see 
http://birg.epfl.ch/page53468.html for an example of our amphibious 
snake robot. the responsibility of the postdoc will be to participate to 
the design of the next generation of the robots (we aim at adding 
muscle-like actuator with useful visco-elastic properties), and to 
design adaptive locomotion controllers based on cpgs. candidates need to 
have a phd degree related to robotics. the ideal candidate for this 
position should have a background in robotics, in particular in 
mechanical design, locomotion control, and learning algorithms, and be 
interested in using robots as tools to understand biology. starting 
date: november 2006 (or as soon as possible after that).

*how to apply:
*
the application should consist of a motivation letter (explaining to 
which of the two positions you would like to apply, and why you feel 
qualified for that project), and a full cv with publication list. two 
(or more) letters of reference should be sent directly by the referees 
to prof. auke ijspeert (emails are preferred).

*deadline and starting date:*

applications are invited from today (20 april 2006), and will be 
considered continuously until the positions are filled.

short description of the research field

------------------------------------------------------

visual sensors give very rich information about the environment, especially 

if arranged in an omni-directional or stereo camera setting. for successful 

implementation of future service and personal robots, enhanced 2 and 3d vision 

is of key importance. this includes especially reliable 3d object recognition 

in dynamic real world setting. unfortunately, reliable interpretation of real world 

images is still a major issue. we have therefore dedicated an important part of 

our work in mobile robotics towards visual 2 and 3d sensing, functional based 

object recognizing and cognitive maps. 

as a postdoc you are expected to coordinate a group of around 3-5 phd student 

in the field and take a leading roll in our related research projects.

13,2006,postdoc position on mams modeling and control,"postdoc position in eu project protem

within the eu protem project, partners from academia and industry of
various eu countries (france, germany, switzerland, uk, netherlands) are
working on a next generation storage system for archiving and backup.
the aim is to realize a 1 petabyte memory in a box as small as a dvd
drive. the technology used will be probe storage, based on the ibm probe
storage program (millipede). in this technology, an array of thousands
of 100 um sized read/write heads is reading and writing data. in the
current architecture, the storage area is limited to the size of the
array, which is restricted to about 1 cm2. within the protem project,
the storage area will be expanded to several hunderd cm2, but the array
will still be small. therefore the array has to be positioned over this
big area with high accuracy and speed.

to study, design and realize this architecture, experts from very
different fields (media, mems, system architecture) will cooperate
closely in this 4 year, 10 meu project. one of the tasks of the
university of twente in the project will be to design and realize the
positioning system. we therefore have a vacancy for a postdoctoral
researcher in the field of (micro-)mechanical modelling for the duration
of 18 months. 

your task will be to evaluate various concepts of positioning systems on
their disadvantages and merits, and determine whether the overall
specifications of the device can be reached and using what concepts. for
this, a solid background in modelling and control engineering or mems is
required. we are looking for a person with strong communication skills,
capable of operating in a large, multi-national team.

idsia is small but visible, competitive, and influential. for example, 
its ant colony optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records 
and are now widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc. (today 
entire conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the 
origin of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial 
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers. idsia's 
artificial recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous 
unlearnable sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, 
artificial evolution and other methods. research topics also include 
complexity and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and 
information theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia was the 
smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the 1997 ""x-lab 
survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth place in the 
category ""computer science - biologically inspired"". idsia's most 
important work was done after 1997 though.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of special 
relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated with 105 
nobel laureates, and boasts the world's highest number of nobel prizes 
per capita, the highest number of publications per capita, the highest 
number of patents per capita, the highest citation impact factor, the 
most cited single-author paper, etc.  switzerland also got the highest 
ranking in the list of happiest countries :-)

idsia was the smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the  
1997 ""x-lab survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth  
place in the category ""computer science - biologically inspired"".  
idsia's most important work was done after 1997 though. it is small  
but visible, competitive, and influential. its highly cited ant colony  
optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records and are now  
widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc (today entire  
conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the origin  
of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial  
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers (previous  
work on general ai was dominated by heuristics). idsia's artificial  
recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous unlearnable  
sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, artificial  
evolution and other methods. research topics also include complexity  
and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and information  
theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia's results were reviewed  
not only in science journals such as nature, science, scientific  
american, but also in numerous popular press articles in time, the ny  
times, der spiegel, etc. many tv shows on tech & science helped to  
popularize idsia's achievements.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of  
special relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated  
with 105 nobel laureates, and boasts far more nobel prizes per capita  
than any other nation. it also has the world's highest number of  
publications per capita, the highest number of patents per capita, the  
highest citation impact factor, the most cited single-author paper,  
etc, etc. switzerland also got the highest ranking in the list of  
happiest countries."

could you forward the ad below to relevant master students in your lab? 
many thanks.

best regards,

auke ijspeert


        *open phd studentship at epfl (switzerland) in *design and
        control of compliant modular robots

the biorobotics laboratory  (biorob, http://biorob.epfl.ch/) at epfl 
(lausanne, switzerland) anticipates to have one *open phd studentship in 
design and control of compliant modular robots,* starting on* december 
2010*. the position will be funded by the national competence center in 
research (nccr) in robotics that will start on december 2010 with 
various institutions in switzerland. the position is fully funded. it 
will involve interactions with several other robotics groups in switzerland.


        background

the goal of the phd thesis will be to participate to the design and 
control of compliant modular robots capable of different types of 
locomotion. there will be a strong focus on hardware implementations by 
reusing and extending existing hardware available in the biorobotics 
laboratory (see the roombots and salamander robot projects). another 
strong focus will be the use of controllers based on systems of coupled 
nonlinear dynamical systems (e.g. oscillators) together with 
optimization and learning algorithms.


        requirements:

candidates need to have a master degree in a field related to robotics 
e.g. in mechanical or electrical engineering, computer science, or 
physics. the ideal candidate for this position should have a strong 
robotics background (having worked with and designed real hardware, e.g. 
in legged and/or modular robotics), good programming skills, and a solid 
mathematical background.


        how to apply:

step 1: the position is only open to applicants who have been accepted 
by the epfl doctoral school (see http://phd.epfl.ch/). the first step is 
therefore to fill the applications for one of the doctoral programs, the 
most relevant being ""manufacturing systems and robotics"" (*deadline 
september 15th!!*),  ""computer, communication and information sciences"" 
and ""electrical engineering"".

step 2: once accepted by one of the doctoral programs (please specify 
which doctoral program and the date of acceptance), the application to 
the position should be sent by email to prof. auke ijspeert and consist 
of a motivation letter (explaining why you are interested in the 
project, and why you feel qualified for it) and a copy of the doctoral 
program application.

informal inquiries about the relevance of an application can be sent to 
auke.ijspeert at epfl.ch (e.g. before or while submitting an application to 
the doctoral school), but responses can be slow because of a heavy 
schedule and a filled mail box.


        deadline and starting date:

applications will be considered continuously until the position is 
filled. the ideal starting date is the *1st of december 2010* (or as 
soon as possible after that date). note that the first deadline is the 
application to one of the epfl doctoral programs,  e.g. the one in 
""manufacturing systems and robotics"" (*deadline september 15th*!!)


        contact:

information concerning the type of research carried out by the group can 
be found at http://biorob.epfl.ch/. you should send your application and 
any inquiry by email to:

65,2011,phd position in parallel robotics at lirmm/etel,"the lirmm (montpellier laboratory of computer science, microelectronics 
and robotics) in france is seeking (again) a candidate for a phd founded 
by etel motion technology, in switzerland.
only high-standing candidatures will be considered.

phd subject title
-----------------------
towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics

context
-----------
high precision industries, such as semi-conductor industry, are in need 
of machines combining high accuracy and high throughput. to date this 
need has been covered mostly by standard equipment such as x-y tables; 
however this approach is now reaching its limits in terms of maximum 
speed and acceleration. on the other hand, robots have been designed for 
pick-and-place industries which can reach very impressive accelerations 
but none of them have demonstrated enough accuracy to satisfy the 
semi-conductor industry requirements.
indeed designers are facing two scientific and technological barriers: 
serial machines suffer from high inertias limiting their acceleration 
capability; parallel mechanisms suffer from poor stiffness limiting 
their accuracy.
this thesis aims at advancing those frontiers and will be developed in 
synergy between the etel company (switzerland) and lirmm (france).

research approach
--------------------------
at first the research work will be guided by generic needs coming from 
industrial applications. starting from this, innovative concepts of 
kinematics, actuation systems, measurement and control strategies should 
be searched for. modeling of various inaccuracy sources (joints, 
transmissions, vibrations, control, etc) should be carried out so that 
their impact on the global system can be clearly understood. in this 
research work, both mechanical design and control issues should be 
investigated. along the project, assessment of results and proof of 
concepts should be made by designing and operating prototypes.

environment
------------------
etel is the world’s leading supplier for direct drive and motion systems 
with research, development and production facilities in môtiers, 
switzerland; lirmm is a joint laboratory of université montpellier 2 and 
cnrs, and is installed in montpellier, france. research will be mostly 
done in montpellier but frequent visits and stays in môtiers are 
foreseen. ph.d. dissertation shall be written in english to facilitate 
dissemination among etel employees.

70,2012,epfl: one phd studentship and one postdoc position in computational neuroscience and biorobotics,"one phd studentship and one postdoc position in computational
      neuroscience and biorobotics

the biorobotics laboratory (biorob, http://biorob.epfl.ch/) at epfl 
(lausanne, switzerland) has two open positions in *computational 
neuroscience and biorobotics,* starting on *june 2012* (or a.s.a.p. 
after that). the goal of the project is to develop *numerical models of 
spinal cord circuits, to participate to the development of new 
salamander robots, and to test the models on the robots*. one position 
is a *phd studentship*, the other is a *postdoc position*. the positions 
are fully funded for 3 years thanks to a grant from the swiss national 
science foundation.


      background

these two positions are part of our salamander robot project which aims 
at using numerical models and robots to get a better understanding of 
the functioning of spinal cord circuits in vertebrate animals, see 
http://biorob.epfl.ch/salamandra 
<http://biorob.epfl.ch/cms/site/salamandra> . the goal of one 
position,*position 1*,  will be to develop the numerical models of the 
spinal cord circuits of the salamander using either systems of coupled 
oscillators or neural network models. the goal of the other position, 
*position 2*,  will be to participate to the design, construction and 
testing of our next generation salamander robot. these positions can be 
taken either as a phd student or as a postdoc.the project is carried out 
together with prof. j.-m. cabelguen, a neurophysiologist at the 
university of bordeaux.


      requirements:

for position 1, candidates need to have a master degree or phd degree in 
a field related to computational neuroscience e.g. in physics or 
computer science. the ideal candidate for this position should have a 
strong math background (e.g. in dynamical systems),  good programming 
skills, and interest/expertise in modeling neural circuits.

for position 2, candidates need to have a master degree or phd degree in 
a field related to biorobotics, e.g. in mechanical, electrical 
engineering, or computer science .the ideal candidate for this position 
should have a strong robotics background (having worked with and 
designed real hardware, e.g. in legged and/or articulated robotics), 
good programming skills, and a solid mathematical background.


      how to apply for the phd studentship:

step 1: the position is only open to applicants who have been accepted 
by the epfl doctoral school (see http://phd.epfl.ch/). the first step is 
therefore to fill the applications for one of the relevant epfl doctoral 
programs.

step 2: once accepted by one of the doctoral programs (please specify 
which doctoral program and the date of acceptance), the application to 
the position should be sent by email to prof. auke ijspeert and consist 
of a motivation letter (explaining which position you are interested in, 
why you are interested in the project, and why you feel qualified for 
it) and a copy of the doctoral program application.

informal inquiries about the relevance of an application can be sent to 
auke.ijspeert at epfl.ch (e.g. before or while submitting an application to 
the doctoral school), but responses can be slow because of a heavy 
schedule and a filled mail box.


      how to apply for the postdoc position:

the postdoc application should consists of a motivation letter 
(explaining which position you are interested in, why you are interested 
in the project, and why you feel qualified for it), a full cv, two or 
three relevant publications, and the email addresses of two referees. 
pdf files are preferred. the files should be sent to auke.ijspeert at epfl.ch.

        lsro1 lab, eplf, lausanne, switzerland (http://lsro1.epfl.ch/)


mission:
----------------

the main objective of the research is the study of strategies and
modalities to let humans and
heterogeneous multi-robot systems (hereafter referred to as swarms)
interacting and teaming
up. physical gaming (i.e., games played by humans and robots together) will
be used as a context of
application and testing. gaming has an important role in people’s life,
providing tools for
entertainment, social interactions, and also contributing shaping cognitive
and sensory-motor
abilities. from a scientific/engineering point of view, it is well
understood that game scenarios are
particularly suitable to study robot(s)-robot(s) and human-robot(s)
interaction in both cooperative
and adversarial settings. the use of a gaming context has the advantage of
letting the designer
define limits for time, place, and rules.

by exploiting these properties, the researcher will develop general
strategies for mutual
interaction and cooperation between humans and robots, with a particular
focus on the issues of
mutual trust, mutual learning, and two-ways, multi-modal communication for
sharing information and
providing commands and hints. the researcher will identify and implement
various schemes for
heterogeneous teaming and playing, in opposition and in cooperation, and
always with humans in the
loop. particular attention will be focused on how a swarm can give guidance
and hints to humans to
optimize team’s utility.

considered the importance of gaming in children’s life, the research will
mainly focus on children
as human players, addressing educational, developmental, and entertainment
issues. one of the
central, practical aims of the research is to design and implement one or
more interactive game
scenarios, based on the integration of multiple and heterogeneous robotic
resources, sensory data
(visual, speech, motion), and children players.


candidate profile:
----------------------

the candidate must hold a ph.d. and possibly have, at least, 1-year
experience as a post-doc. she/he
must have excellent scientific records, be highly motivated, and have a
strong background and research
expertise in the following domains:

 * robotics
 * multi-robot/swarm systems
 * design and implementation of game scenarios and systems
 * acquisition and processing of multi-modal data based on visual, speech,
and other forms of input.

scientific experience in social robotics and/or in children psychology will
be an important
advantage, as well as a good familiarity with machine learning techniques
and distributed
algorithms. she/he is expected to have outstanding mathematical and
programming skills (in c/c++,
and preferably in linux environments), and to have a positive attitude
toward interdisciplinary
research and teamwork.


time frame and additional information
----------------------------------------------

 * deadline for submission of applications: january 31, 2013

phd fellowship

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional 

contacts: luca.brayda at iit.it or gabriel.baud-bovy at iit.it

population of 181.513 (october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . http://www.ntnu.edu/livingintrh/about-trondheim http://www.trondheim.no/engelsk/ about  norway  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system. http://www.ntnu.edu/livingintrh/about- norway  http://www.visit norway .com/en/"

able to choose the type of exercise that suits him/her best from sequences of games composed together to create workouts, dance exercises based on traditional dances from different european countries or tai chi training, all with social capabilities to foster community engagement and enhance cultural and cognitive aspects. all exercises will be monitored using available motion sensors, with special focus on inertial sensors, therefore allowing and promoting the use of the smartphone as the main sensor. the use of other common sensors, like kinect, will also be considered. the project will also include the development of a specially designed sensor featuring an imu that can be attached to specific parts of the body to allow proper and accurate tracking of all body movements. the use of multiple sensors simultaneously may also be considered for a better evaluation of body movement. these imus, being cheap and easy to use, will be provided whenever there is no possibility to use any other sensor. 2. notre ------------- the vision of notre is to develop a network that will strengthen and enhance the potential of the newly established social computing research centre (scrc) at the cyprus university of technology (cut) for stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in the area of social aspects of computing. notre proposes an interdisciplinary approach towards the close network collaboration between scrc of cut, a research active university in a low-performing member state, and four internationally-leading counterparts specializing in: (a) online social networks and their analysis; (b) entertainment, games, virtual reality and educational technologies; (c) social computing for social inclusion; and (d) social computing and social change. scrc through this proposal does not only aim to access the core research groups of the leading counterparts, and their collaborators, but also recognizes the multidisciplinarity of the field and will try to establish itself as an intermediate between them. the notre network will follow a series of interlinked activities, such as short term staff exchanges, expert visits and short-term on-site training, workshops, conference attendance, organization of joint summer school type activities, and dissemination and outreach activities. such activities with world-renowned eu partners (imdea; miralab of universite de geneve; institute of computer science of the foundation for research and technology hellas -forth-ics; and the department of political science of the university of dusseldorf -udus), will be instrumental for significantly strengthening scrc's research efforts, enhancing the network's innovation capacity and research profile, and stimulating scientific excellence in the emerging multidisciplinary field of social computing. university of geneva ====================== the university of geneva is a public research university located in geneva, switzerland. it was

demonstration are turned toward  developing algorithms for the acquisition of specific skills from  training data. while such developments are important, they often do not  take into account the social structure of the process, in particular,  that the interaction with the user and the selection of the different  interaction steps can directly influence the quality of the collected  data. in rosalis, we propose to rely on natural interactions for skill  learning, involving queries about the skills, and demonstrations made by  both the human and the robot to show what it has learned. the research will advance on several fronts. first, for skills  representation, the robot learners will require an appropriate level of  plasticity, allowing them to adapt, refine or freeze a skill primitive  currently being learned. furthermore, active learning methodologies will  be developed, relying on heterogeneous sources of information  (demonstrations, feedback labels, properties), allowing to make  hypotheses about the skill invariants and to suggest demonstrations or  queries. secondly, to allow natural interactions, we will design  perception algorithms to provide a higher level understanding of people  behaviors and intentions, including gaze information and multimodal  action recognition and segmentation. the different mechanisms will be  integrated for modeling the interaction, implying the coordination  (selection, timing) of the different interaction units. we target applications of robots in both manufacturing (with baxter and  franka robots) and home/office environments (with the pepper robot),  both requiring re-programming in an efficient and personalized manner. --- about idiap: idiap is an independent, not-for-profit, research institute recognized

2) these trajectories  are recovered during execution and adapted to new situations with  real-time model predictive control, with generalization to dynamically  changing environments; and 3) available sensor modalities (vision,  inertial, haptic) are exploited for feedback control which goes beyond  the basic robot state with a focus on robust and adaptive behavior. memmo is organized around 3 applications designed by the end-user  partners of the project: 1) a humanoid robot performing advanced  locomotion and industrial tooling tasks for aircraft assembly; 2) an  advanced exoskeleton paired with a paraplegic patient demonstrating  dynamic walking on flat floor, slopes and stairs in a rehabilitation  center; and 3) a quadruped robot performing inspection tasks in a  construction site. in memmo, idiap is responsible of the research aspects related to the  representation and encoding of movements. the objective is to compress  motion data for fast recognition and adaptive motion synthesis. this  will be achieved by extracting invariant structures in a probabilistic  form that can be used to generalize movements to new situations (new  environments, new contexts, new initial conditions). models will be  developed to facilitate integration between learning and control, with  trajectory distributions (incl. the underlying cost functions) that are  adapted to the current situation and can be used to quickly generate  trajectory samples for further optimization. --- about idiap: idiap is an independent, not-for-profit, research institute recognized  and funded by the swiss federal government, the state of valais, and the  city of martigny. idiap offers competitive salaries and conditions at  all levels in a young, high-quality, dynamic, and multicultural  environment. idiap is an equal opportunity employer and is actively  involved in the ""advancement of women in science"" european initiative.  the institute seeks to maintain a principle of open competition (on the  basis of merit) to appoint the best candidate, provides equal  opportunity for all candidates, and equally encourage both genders to apply. idiap is located in the town of martigny in valais, a scenic region in  the south of switzerland, surrounded by the highest mountains of europe,  and offering exceptional quality of life, exciting recreational  activities, including hiking, climbing and skiing, as well as varied  cultural activities. it is within close proximity to lausanne and  geneva. although idiap is located in the french part of switzerland,  english is the official working language. free french lessons are also  provided on a complimentary basis. for frequently asked questions (faqs) about living in switzerland,  please go to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.idiap.ch_en_faq&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=s8besnc1tcdlygac1xfxenztk4imvk2ivivamqfzhxo&s=mhydjhmwf0vk-rsbwptzbgeg3sbyojt1z3wj02yzpeg&e= --  dr sylvain calinon, idiap research institute, martigny, switzerland https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__calinon.ch&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=s8besnc1tcdlygac1xfxenztk4imvk2ivivamqfzhxo&s=lzjyo1mndprubnnd4njifsnpuualgacb79kcf52g4qg&e="

developing algorithms for the acquisition of specific skills from training data. while such developments are important, they often do not take into account the social structure of the process, in particular, that the interaction with the user and the selection of the different interaction steps can directly influence the quality of the collected data. in rosalis, we propose to rely on natural interactions for skill learning, involving queries about the skills, and demonstrations made by both the human and the robot to show what it has learned.  phd position: besides research on skills representation and active learning methodologies relying on heterogeneous sources of information (demonstrations, feedback labels, properties), the project will investigate novel perception algorithms to allow natural interactions between the robot and the teacher. the aim is to provide a higher level understanding of the teacher behaviors and intentions  through audio, speech, gaze, and gesture (arm, body, head) analysis, in relation with the (unknown) skill she is teaching to the robot. this implies understanding (and distinguishing) her communication signals (yes, no, explanation) including the feedback about and during demonstrations made by the robot, and the multimodal demonstrations (partial or global) she is making of the skill to be learned. the different mechanisms (skill learning, active learning, perception) will be integrated in a global model of interaction, implying the coordination (selection, timing) of different smaller interaction units. we target applications of robots in both manufacturing (with baxter and franka robots) and home/office environments (with the pepper robot), both requiring re-programming in an efficient and personalized manner.  rosalis is a snsf funded project involving both the perception and activity understanding group (jean-marc odobez,
