the white paper can address all three aspects or focus  on one of them. the white paper much include: * name, affiliation, email address * a (max) 1.5 page position statement please submit  the white paper as regular text or as a pdf file. too  long white papers will be discarded. position papers that focus on  current research are not appropriate. a white paper should present a  future vision and not merely discuss state of the art. white papers should be submitted by **end of the day august 15** to   roadmapping at robotics-vo.org. late submissions may not be considered. we  will evaluate submitted white papers by 18 august and select people for  the workshops by 19 august. the workshop reports will use used as the basis for a synthesis of a new  roadmap. the nominal timeline is * august 2019 - call for white papers * sep - nov 2019 - workshops * dec 2019 - workshops reports finalized * jan 2020 - synthesis meeting @ ucsd * feb 2020 - publish draft roadmap for community feedback * apr 2020 - revision of roadmap based on community feedback * may 2020 - finalize roadmap with graphics design, ?
