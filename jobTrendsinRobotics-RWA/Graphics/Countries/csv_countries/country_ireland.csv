page cover letter and cv.


research in ubiquitous robotics:
some of the available positions will address the area of robots integrated in ubiquitous,
pervasive, and intelligent environments.
such robots are part of open and distributed networks of sensors, actuators, and computing services,
which can also act as a shared information space for both the robots and the humans they interact with.
some of the relevant research directions foreseen within this area are:
-     the application of agent-oriented software engineering (aose)          
      and multi-agent system (mas) coordination techniques to develop        
      distributed and adaptive software architectures.
      these architectures are defined in terms of distributed and autonomous software modules
      (agents), which can exhibit global self-configuration properties and can also deliver context
      sensitive and personalized services to both the users and the robots in the environment.

-     the integration between robots and wireless sensor networks (wsns), that is, robots acting as
      mobile gateways or otherwise working to the advantage of networks of wirelessly connected   
      sensors, e.g.  carrying out maintenance, localization, and calibration operations in applications
      such as security, search & rescue, and surveillance systems.

24,2019,"funded phd position in  ""miniaturisationof a novel friction-sensing tactile sensor"" at ucd,   ireland  (stephen redmond)"," online  ireland   position description: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__euraxess.ec.europa.eu_jobs_465425&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=xewhcynlrbpkxiih1fkt0tct1gtukr-jkeujvsikafm&e=  *phd in miniaturisation of a novel friction-sensing tactile sensor* *background:* prosthetic and robotic hands demonstrate poor dexterity during object manipulation, often dropping objects. humans rarely allow objects to slip because we can sense if an object is slippery and adjust our grip. this research program has three work packages: (wp1) to advance our understanding of how humans sense friction; (wp2) to demonstrate, using a number of friction-based tactile sensor prototypes currently under development by our research groups in dublin and sydney, that friction sensing leads to improved dexterity in robotic manipulation; *(wp3) to use advanced design, manufacturing, and instrumentation methods to miniaturise the proposed sensors to a scale similar to a human finger pad*. the outcomes of this research, which would endow artificial hands with the ability to feel the slipperiness and/or impending loss of grip of a grasped object, could significantly advance the fields of prosthetics, telesurgery, and service, agricultural, and manufacturing robotics. *phd scope:* the candidate will work on *wp3 of this project, refining and miniaturising the existing tactile sensor design concepts under development at ucd (dublin,  ireland ) and unsw (sydney, australia)*. see demo: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__youtu.be_ukqe-5fnobhjo&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=oyreem5u0sdds_6ulqz5q7rw1rvxep81qyo6eypoftc&e= . we have developed a novel optical technique to instrument silicone protrusions which resemble the papillae found in the skin of the human finger pad. we can measure forces and displacements with excellent accuracy (millinewtons and micrometres, respectively). creating a dense array of such protrusion allows us to approximate the biomechanics of the human pad, and possibly exceed its sensitivity; the human finger has an effective density of about 500 sensing elements across the finger pad. in addition to measuring contact forces, torques, vibration, and slip, the proposed design concept ultimately allows us to sense the friction of the contact without ever completely losing the grasp. *the candidate will miniaturise the proposed tactile sensor (robot finger pad) design using advanced sub-millimetre manufacturing techniques; by creating a dense array of deformable sensing elements, and by developing novel light generation and detection optoelectronic circuits which are both suitable for mass production and operate effectively at the proposed device dimensions. the candidate will demonstrate that this miniaturised design retains the ability to estimate friction from slip events on the periphery of the finger pad before complete loss of grip occurs.* *supervision and research environment:* the candidate will be supervised by *a/prof stephen redmond* (school of electrical and electronic engineering, ucd https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__people.ucd.ie_stephen.redmond&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=y7fg6kmyejqpen4yvwrtq4hxsaxypoa7gancfjc3i6w&e= ). the candidate will also collaborate with dr heba khamis at unsw (sydney, australia). the candidate will have an opportunity to contribute to the sfi insight centre for data analytics ( https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.insight-2dcentre.org_&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=fhvw2com1bfa2wuanmhnme0e97ablajtbx21gq64uiu&e= ) based at ucd. there are also ongoing commercialisation activities around this technology ( https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.contactile.com&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=68ayprhvioouvvu1ns_juujrsn_w7cbeevoqwhejcgy&s=b6bfmdukfuy2918rilrfbz-rmgwlriwyqub-wb9ecvy&e= ). *funding:* a *stipend of **?**18,500 per annum plus tuition fee is available for a maximum of four years*. the project is generously funded by science foundation  ireland ?s president of  ireland  future research leaders award, held by a/prof redmond, which includes an extensive budget for laboratory apparatus, consumables, and travel. both tactile sensor design work packages are also partly supported by us office of naval research global funding held by a/prof redmond and dr heba khamis at unsw (sydney, australia). *academic requirements:* the minimum academic qualification is a *first- or upper-second-class honours degree* (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, software engineering, computer engineering, mechanical or mechatronic engineering, biomedical engineering, robotics, or a related field which provides sufficient background in the skills required for the successful completion of this project. desirable skills include knowledge of, or experience with: *3d printers;

28,2020,full-time international phd position at  university college dublin  ireland  ," phd  ireland  : develop a framework using machine learning (ml) to identify specific features of stress response using plant phenotyping background:early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant for food security but methodologically complex. plant stress responses can be observed using non-invasive methods such as plant imaging. the use of different camera sensors such as rgb, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence enable the detection of altered plant performance in response to environmental stress. such changes include slower growth, senescent changes in the spectral reflectance and modified fluorescence responses of leaves. although these changes cannot be captured by human eye, the imaging sensors used in this project can perceive such changes very fast. to understand the early responses of plants to environmental stress, we will develop a framework of data collection, storage and curation, trait extraction and utilization of ml and classification algorithms to extract the features from plant images. plant images will be collected using imaging platforms in a controlled environment and unmanned aerial vehicles in field conditions(uavs). project:this exciting project will develop a specific framework that utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization and visualisation to identify specific features of stress response using thousands of plant images. the ph.d. student will have the opportunity to participate

a critical role in defining offspring health, both in childhood and in later life. according to the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) hypothesis, transient environmental exposures during critical periods of development (such as the pre-conceptional, fetal and early infant phases of life) can alter the health trajectory of the offspring. maternal diet is a modifiable behaviour that could play an important role in maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. novel findings from our individual birth cohort studies and the alphabet consortium highlight the potential influence of maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential during pregnancy on birth outcomes and a range of offspring childhood health outcomes. however limited data regarding the interrelationships between maternal diet and lifestyle, placental development and birth and childhood outcomes in humans exist. project: this exciting project will address this gap in the knowledge base by harnessing information on maternal diet &amp; lifestyle and pregnancy/birth/offspring outcomes using existing databases and analysis of biological samples from several birth cohort studies. the phd student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by dr catherine phillips, assistant professor and lead principal investigator for this research programme at the school of public health, physiotherapy and sports science, university college dublin. details: this is a 4-year full-time position, open to eu and non-eu candidates, with a stipend of 18,000 per annum.  qualifications: candidates should hold a bachelor's degree in nutrition, biological sciences (physiology, developmental biology, reproduction), public health or related field and have an interest in early life/fetal programming, nutrition and metabolic health. experience in pregnancy and childhood research, epigenetics or nutritional assessment techniques would be desirable.  application process: informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to dr. catherine phillips (catherine.phillips at ucd.ie). applications including a detailed cv, letter of motivation (max 2 pages, single spaced), transcripts and two letters of recommendation (to be sent directly from referee) should be sent to catherine.phillips at ucd.ieno later than march 23rd 2020. 	phd opportunity: dietary sugars / sweeteners during pregnancy and their impact on long term maternal metabolic and reproductive health background: there is significant evidence that an unhealthy diet greatly increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and predisposes offspring to metabolic dysfunction and obesity. while fat intake is typically associated with the onset of obesity and its comorbidities, there is increasing evidence linking sugar, particularly high fructose corn syrup, to the global rise in obesity rates. furthermore the detrimental effects of fructose intake during pregnancy on mother and child have been clearly outlined. despite their wide availability there is only limited information regarding their impact on maternal pregnancy outcomes, placental/fetal development and long term risk of cardio-metabolic complications in the mother. previous work from the group has demonstrated that the artificial sweetener ace-k increases insulin resistance during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. this project will investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners in combination with a high fat diet during pregnancy on maternal obesity, metabolic and reproductive health during successive pregnancies. this project will provide training in key laboratory skills ranging from rodent physiology, biochemical, cellular and molecular techniques. training in experimental design, data analysis and scientific writing will also be provided. this project would be ideal for a student with a background in a biological science (nutrition, physiology, reproduction, biochemistry) with a keen interested in nutrition and metabolic health. funding information:this is a 4-year full-time position with a stipend of e18,000 per annum. how to

new collaborative science foundation ireland (sfi) strategic partnership research programme, entitled consus, focussed on the application of precision agriculture to crop production with a particular emphasis on optimisation of agri-food production systems leading to more efficient food production with lower environmental impacts. the outcomes from this research programme will deliver a step-change in crop agronomy tools and practices, leading to enhanced global competitiveness. applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a 4-year phd studentship with the consus team researching crop nutrition and limits to yield potential. globally, major gains in crop yield and quality have been made through the application of the major plant nutrients (macronutrients) such as n, p and k in fertilizer. however, with the supply of adequate levels of these macronutrients, concentrations of micronutrients, such as zn, cu and mn, in soil and plant can drop below optimum and become yield- and quality-limiting. this is particularly the case in more intensive cropping systems with higher yields and removal of micronutrients in exported plant materials. fertilizer n is a major variable input cost to most conventional farming systems. in addition, poor use efficiency can increase the risk of loss to the wider environment, and associated impacts on water quality, air quality, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. this phd will use laboratory and field experimental approaches to develop an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat. this position will be in the ucd school of agriculture and food science

commonly associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs. in humans, most hev infections cause an acute, self-limiting hepatitis. however, severe disease can occur, particularly in pregnant women or those with pre-existing liver disease. hev infection is also associated with other disease manifestations including neurological disease, however the reason why severe disease occurs is poorly understood. currently, there are no specific treatments for hev, and there is no licenced vaccine in europe. hev is extremely challenging to propagate in cell culture, and there is no robust method to screen food products for the presence of infectious virus. this project will aim to develop in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hev, and to use these systems to investigate the biology of this virus in pigs and humans. the student will work with an interdisciplinary team at ucd, based at the veterinary sciences centre, and will have the opportunity to develop their research skills in one health and zoonotic disease. the student will collaborate with research groups at ucd, the university of birmingham and pirbright institute in the uk, and the cleveland clinic, ohio, usa, over the course of the phd programme. this is a truly interdisciplinary project, working on an important and poorly understood viral infection. we are searching for an enthusiastic individual, with a first or upper second-class degree in a relevant subject, to work on this exciting and novel project. ideally, the candidate should have laboratory experience, and previous experience in molecular biology and cell culture techniques would be an advantage. funding notes: applications and enquiries should be directed to dr. nicola fletcher at the veterinary sciences centre, university college dublin, ireland (nicola.fletcher at ucdconnect.ie). please submit a cv and letter of motivation with applications. the stipend for this position will be 18,500 + full eu or

post doc position, please write to prof. rafael sacks, atcvsacks at technion.ac.il the design and use of technology has serious implications for society as a whole. there is increasing public concern about issues such as anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of military and surveillance technologies, and the possible impacts of automation and artificial intelligence. however, decisions about technological systems are often made without transparency or democratic oversight. engineers bear much of the responsibility for the development, construction, and maintenance of technological systems, but in whose interests do they act? engineering institutions claim to be committed to public welfare, but can engineers really balance that commitment with meeting the demands of employers and clients? there is in fact evidence to suggest that the culture of engineering education and professional practice discourages engineers from placing sufficient importance on public welfare. further research is needed in this area; this phd will address that need by exploring the relationship between engineering, professional responsibility, and public welfare. both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be used to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of engineering students and professionals in ireland, as well as the contexts in which these engineers study and work. applications for this phd scholarship are invited from candidates from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography, education, and design. candidates should have or expect to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree in their field. please direct any queries about the project or application to donal.holland at ucd.ie.

the advantages of the technology is its ability to tailor the design, to meet specific patient needs. given the individualized part printing however, a key consideration is to ensure the quality of the printed device. this phd project will involve the printing of both polymeric and fibre reinforced polymer composites, for use in prosthetic devices. the printing will be carried out using both a laboratory and a pilot scale fused filament fabrication system. the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the printed parts will be extensively investigated and correlated with the processing conditions. a number of advanced process diagnostic techniques (including optical imagining), will be used to monitor the printing process. working closely with colleagues in computer science, the data collected will be analysed, in order to provide process feedback. the objective is to determine if the in-process measurements can be correlated with print defects (i.e. porosity), and where possible can help to predict the formation of defects before they occur. funding: scholarship support for this phd is through the science foundationi-form advanced manufacturing research centre. phd funding is available for eu students only. applicant requirement: a minimum of a 2.1 honours degree in engineering, chemistry, physics or materials science. application: to apply, please
