18,2010,"open post-doc position in robot audition, laas-cnrs, toulouse, france","======================================================================
post-doctoral position at laas-cnrs, robotics action perception group
18 months, starting immediately
monthly gross salary: 2500eur

design and implementation of a reconfigurable bioinspired
auditory sensor for the humanoid robot hrp2
======================================================================

robot audition is a fairly  new research area.  the auditory modality,
which   is  near-omnidirectional   and  insensitive   to  illumination
conditions, constitutes an ideal complement to vision.  in the topical
human-robot interaction context,  audition can enable the localization
of a speaker located outside the robot viewfield, his/her recognition,
the extraction of  his/her utterance out of the  environment, prior to
the interpretation of his/her message.

two approaches to robot audition  can be envisioned.  on the one hand,
array processing methods exploit the  redundancy of the data sensed by
an array  of microphones so as  to improve the  properties of auditory
functions  under design:  resolution of  source  localization, spatial
filtering  efficiency,  robustness to  noise,...   in  this vein,  the
laas-cnrs has developed an integrated  auditory sensor on the basis of
a linear  array of 8 microphones  and a fpga processing  unit.  on the
other hand, binaural approaches consist in fitting two ears on a head,
and  mimic  the human  system  to  various  extents.  yet,  exploiting
bioinspired cues may require a  very accurate model of propagation, as
well as a careful  identification---generally in an anechoic room---of
the scattering  of the  wavefield induced by  the head.   such systems
often  lack  adaptability  when  facing realistic,  a  priori  unknown
environments.    on  the  whole,   biomimetic  approaches   to  source
localization and extraction have so far led to mitigated results.

the proposed post-doctoral study  aims at designing and implementing a
bioinspired sensor  for the hrp2  humanoid robot hosted  by laas-cnrs.
this  sensor  will  comply  with  the  geometrical  and  computational
foundations involved in humans.  so, the hrp2 head will be fitted with
two pinnae  which reproduce the  spatial filtering performed  by human
ears.  similarly, the physico-electrical transduction will reflect the
human operation,  e.g.  through the tonotopic frequency  coding in the
cochlea, the global response of  the hair cells, etc.  the sensor will
have  to  be  embeddable   and  reconfigurable,  in  order  to  enable
experiments  on  the  robot  as  well as  iterations  and  adjustments
necessary to an ""optimal""  design.  on this sensory basis, bioinspired
acoustic  cues (interaural amplitude  and phase  differences, monaural
spectral cues,  etc.) will  be generated and  will serve as  basis for
localization.   an  evaluation  will  be  conducted on  how  a  strong
biomimetism affects  the accuracy  and robustness of  localization and
extraction strategies  in the changing  and unpredictable environments
typical of robotics.

these  scientific  objectives entail  software  development, but  also
hardware (design of the  pinnae, selection of the transducers, signals
digitization,  hardcoding  on  fpga   of  functions  which  have  been
successfully  tested  offline, etc.).   the  work  will  draw on  past
achievements  at  laas,  with  the  support  of  the  engineering  and
technical staff of the laboratory.

this  post-doctoral  study takes  place  within  an internal  research
project at laas-cnrs, and  within the binaahr project (binaural active
audition for humanoid robots) recently  accepted in the framework of a
joint  international  program  between  the french  national  research
agency  (anr)  and the  japan  science  and  technology agency  (jst)."
19,2010,postdoc position: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment,"development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera 
in soc environment

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.
in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.
the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.
in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

*hardware and software development of robots under neural control. *our 
group specializes in the development of alternative control methods for 
robots. we use neuronal circuitry and mechanisms of neural plasticity 
(learning) to control machines with up to 20dof. this type of research 
is internationally highly competitive and has led to the development of 
/runbot/, which had been for some time the fastest dynamic biped walker 
(see the internet for runbot, manoonpong et al., plos cb, 2007), 
/amos-wd6/, a hexapod which uses deterministic chaos to control its 
walking (steingrube et al., nature physics, 2010) as well as /3d-trunk/, 
an elephant-like trunk (ning and wörgötter, ieee-tro, 2009). thus, our 
group tries to bridge the gap between brain function and robotics. 
recently we have started to investigate how to emulate “dynamic motor 
primitives” (dmps, ijspeert and schaal 2003sss) by neural circuitry, by 
which they would become accessible to neural plasticity, offering an 
efficient learning method. in this field we cooperate with kit 
(karlsruhe, developers of the humanoid armar 3, prof. r.dillmann, dr.

24,2010,"very urgent postdoc position: smart camera, vhdl, 3d reconstruction","please find the following position available now.

*title of post-doc: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for 
ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment*

* *

*description*

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.

in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.

the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.

in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

32,2011,"phd student opening, toyota technological institute, japan","phd student openings in compliant robotics
department of advanced science and technology
control systems laboratory
toyota technological institute

the control systems laboratory in toyota technological institute, 
nagoya, japan, has new openings for phd students within the research 
area of compliant motion generation for legged systems.
here are the descriptions for research themes:

theme 1: multimodal biped robot locomotion through the utilization of 
active/passive compliance

the de-facto approach so far in humanoid robotics was to make use of 
non-backdrivable stiff transmissions systems that are combined with high 
gain servo controllers.
although these properties provide highly precise positioning, the 
resulting large mechanical output impedance makes them inherently 
incapable of handling the unpredictable environmental conditions.
this research theme is aimed at remedying these problems by exploiting 
the compliance control in multimodal biped robot locomotion.


theme 2: exoskeleton/power assist robot control

in control systems laboratory of toyota technological institute, we 
built a whole-body power assist robot to provide power augmentation for 
humans.
power augmentation is required in various situations; i) manipulating 
heavy objects (upper body) or ii) providing assistance to legs for 
walking motion (lower body)
the main goal in this research topic is to develop a control methodology 
which handles the aforementioned power augmentation scenes while 
ensuring the safe human-robot co-existence.

the phd students will be supervised by prof. tatsuo narikiyo, prof. 
michihiro kawanishi and dr. barkan ugurlu. monthly scholarships will be 
provided.

we are seeking open-minded and ambitious real team players who possess 
master's degree in electrical/mechanical/mechatronic engineering or 
computer science, with a strong background in robotics manipulation and 
control theory.
candidates should also be good at programming in matlab and c/c++.
additional research/experience on legged locomotion, machine learning, 
advanced control, mechatronic system design is a plus.

the research environment requires mastering the english language in both 
writing, speaking and reading.
gradually increasing japanese language ability will make your life more 
enjoyable in japan, but not required.

to apply, please send the following documents to barkan ugurlu; 
barkanu at toyota-ti.ac.jp <mailto:barkanu at toyota-ti.ac.jp>.

i) detailed cv
ii) research statement, 1-2 pages (please choose either theme 1 or theme 
2. not both!)
iii) two reference letters
iv) transcripts of grades
v) master's thesis
vi) publications (if any)
vii) any other additional support material.


toyota technological institute is located in nagoya, the third largest 
incorporated city in japan. [wiki]. refer to the following wiki article

35,2012,2 phd positions - control and learning for autonomous legged manipulation - eth zurich,"2 fully funded phd research assistant positions at the agile and 
dexterous robotics lab at eth zürich

**[project description]**

* position a - control of autonomous legged manipulation

this project aims at pushing the state of the art of model based control 
and planning for robots with arms and legs in unstructured environments. 
we aim at dynamic locomotion and manipulation, running, jumping, fast 
reaching, reaching and manipulating while walking etc. these motions 
should be at all time precisely planned and controlled through the 
appropriate use of force, impedance and whole body model based control.

* position b: learning control for autonomous legged manipulation

this projects will study how a robot can autonomously acquire the skills 
and models required to accomplish precise dynamic control of its arms 
and legs in unstructured environments. the goal is to complement the 
model based controller and planner methods with adaptive and learning 
methods, to adapt to changes in the robot & environment dynamics, e.g. 
payloads, different grounds, failures of components etc.

background:

the successful candidates will work in the frame of a larger effort to

more strength or endurance or are simply tedious. these tasks pose many 
challenging problems for robots, from control to perception and 
'intelligence'.

the successful candidates for this positions are going to work on 
control and learning control for such robots doing 'autonomous mobile 
legged manipulation'.

the solutions will be evaluated in the frame of a mock-up disaster

===========================================================================

description: realizing proficient human robot collaboration is a fundamental
challenge for robotics and in recent years it is becoming more and more
central, as robots use becomes more pervasive in society. in particular, an
important question is how to translate humans’ social skills into
human-robot interaction. we suggest that the efficient human mutual
understanding relies substantially on the implicit, non-verbal communication
associated to human motion (1, 2, 3). our approach aims at understanding
which robotic features promote natural and fluid human-robot interaction,
using robots both as tools to investigate human brain functions and as test
bed for the derived models. currently we are testing the motor and
perceptual principles usually adopted in human collaboration - as goal
anticipation (4, 5), automatic imitation (5), context-dependent perception
(6), weight understanding from action observation (7,8) - during human-robot
interaction experiments with the icub platform. the topic we propose as phd
activity is to further investigate how to establish efficient human - robot
collaboration by exploiting the natural mechanisms in place for human
interaction. the research will be based on designing different human-robot
interactive scenarios and assessing the efficiency of the collaboration and
the acceptance by the user, by means of multiple techniques, as
eye-tracking, motion capture and force measurements. the successful
candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the
osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie
curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her
knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes. 

requirements: background in computer sciences, robotics, computational or
behavioral neurosciences is required, as also willingness to make
experiments with human participants and strong motivation to work and adapt
to a multidisciplinary environment.

description: social skills play a fundamental role since the very early
development stages. infants present a marked inclination for social
interaction, ranging from the preference for biological motion and mutual
gaze to imitation of facial expressions and auditory, oral, and motor
matching. such social inclination is supported by the gradual evolution of
the production and understanding of social signals, such as gestures, gaze
direction and emotional displays. to gain a deeper understanding of this
crucial stage of human development our goal is to design models of the
perceptual primitives supporting the acquisition of social skills in infants
and to test them on a humanoid robot. computer vision and machine learning
state-of-the-art methods will be the building blocks of the research to be
carried out. 

requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer
engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving. a
background on computer vision is an asset.

41,2013,ph.d. position: humanoid walking on deformable terrains,"ph.d. position

topic: humanoid walking on deformable terrains


humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and poly-articulated
robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat surfaces,
slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated walking
gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic locomotion are
still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily flat) supports in
the environment. humans and animals however are capable to walk on
deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on highly
deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains: the first
ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or mud), the
second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least) part of it
when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).

in the frame of the forthcoming koroibot fp7 eu project (starting in october
2013), the topic of the thesis is to make current humanoids capable to walk
on such deformable terrains, by developing adequate models and controllers.
one particularity of the koroibot project is to measure human strategies

45,2013,post-doctoral position at cnrs/aist jrl,"*topic*: *humanoid walking on deformable terrains *





humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and
poly-articulated robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat
surfaces, slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated
walking gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic
locomotion are still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily
flat) supports in the environment. humans and animals however are capable
to walk on deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on
highly deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains:
the first ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or
mud), the second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least)
part of it when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).



in the frame of the koroibot fp7 eu project, the topic of this post-doc is
to make current humanoids capable to walk on such deformable terrains, by
developing adequate models and controllers. one particularity of the
koroibot project is to measure human strategies that may possibly inspire
the strategy of the controllers. this study will be performed at one of the
koroibot team and the interested candidate will be involved in the
recording and the interpretation of motion capture data of human walking on
different deformable terrains. these data can be exploited to design the
control strategy for humanoid walking. once implemented and experimented
(under similar human measurement conditions), we will compare the results
and assess the robustness and the quality of the humanoid robot walks.



these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging
scenarios involving the hrp-2 and hrp-4 humanoid robots.


 *locations*: the post-doc will be conducted at the cnrs-aist joint
robotics laboratory, umi 3218/crt at tsukuba, japan and also partly at the
cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. 3 months shall be spent at one of
the partners’ laboratory to conduct human-motion capture data.


*duration*: 2 years, possible extension to 3 years.



we are looking for a candidate with a good background in humanoid walking,

on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system. http://www.ntnu.edu/livingintrh/about- norway  http://www.visit norway .com/en/"

clopema: www.clopema.eu; rasoroso). requirements:applicants are expected to have a strong motivation for at least one of the following key topics in robotics: robot control, robot programming, mechatronics. furthermore, good attitude for experimental work is mandatory. the candidates must have: very good programming skills with different languages (including c/c++, python, matlab/simulink); confidence with electronic hardware and be capable to conduct experiments; attitude to problem solving, and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 2:tactile sensing technologies and perception description:tactile sensing is one key topic for the development of future robots capable of complex interaction with humans and objects. design of tactile sensors as well as tactile based sensing, perception and control are challenging research topics and university of genova has gained a solid reputation in this area in the past few years, and has been involved in important international research projects related to this topic (roboskin: www.roboskin.eu; clopema: www.clopema.eu). tactile data convey information about the characteristics of the contact between the robot and the manipulated objects. this information is fundamental to proper control the grasping and manipulation; furthermore, controlled manipulation can in turn be used to extract further information useful to recognize and classify objects and contacts. the objective of the phd topic is to investigate techniques and methodologies for tactile data sensing, perception and interpretation. furthermore, since tactile data are generated by active manipulation control another objective is the study of the mechanisms relating tactile based feedback robot control and tactile data perception. requirements:applicants are expected to have strong background and experience in at least one of the following topics: robot control, machine learning, system identification. the candidates must have: very good programming skills with different languages (including c/c++, matlab/simulink); experience with electronic hardware; be capable to conduct experiments and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 3:a study about how humans perceive robots in interaction processes description:human-robot interaction is expected to play a significant role in the near future. as soon as robots will be employed in environments and for tasks requiring them to be in close contact with humans, the implications of their behaviours on human attitudes, emotions and feelings (eventually, behaviour) cannot be underestimated. we are interested in assessing and measuring the effects of controlled robot behaviours on humans, specifically in all those aspects constituting what in cognitive psychology is termed non-verbal behaviour (e.g., gestures and their parameters, head motions, gaze), while humans and robots are engaged in a collaborative activity. in fact, literature suggests that humans can be greatly influenced (at the subconscious level) by environmental and human factors, and their actions be dependent on perceptions they do not even conceptualise. the phd proposal has two main objectives: on the one hand, design, investigate and assess methods to adapt experimental protocols borrowed from behavioural and cognitive psychology to understand how human behaviour can be influenced by robot behaviour, and how humans interpret it; on the other hand, synthetize robot behaviours which take human expectations into account, and convey a specific (non-verbal) message as humans would do. to this aim, the student will have also to encode specific sensorimotor skills, which will be mediated by insights in cognitive and behavioural psychology. such skills will have to be part of a robot behavioural architecture able to allow for advanced forms of cognitive human-robot interaction. the experimental assessment will be conducted using a baxter dual-arm manipulator in the context of human-robot interaction processes, e.g., object handovers. the project will be conducted in cooperation with university college london (uk), the national institute of informatics and keio university (both in japan). requirements:ontology-based and probabilistic knowledge representation techniques. software development in c/c++. problem-solving and experimental attitude. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 4:the use of language to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning in human-robot interaction tasks description:according to the cognitive perspective on language development and evolution in humans, the language faculty plays a decisive role in the development of both rational thought and reasoning. such an approach criticises the classical paradigm which views language as a communication capability derived from thought and its basic rules as a by product, i.e., the chomsky?s notion of universal grammar. if the cognitive perspective has some degree of plausibility, then the implications in human-robot interaction scenarios can be particularly important. the main objective of this phd proposal is to investigate methods to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning capabilities by means of a dialogue-based human-robot interaction process. we aim at a scenario where a human teaches a robot about objects, their properties and mutual configurations, using both demonstration and dialogue. the robot must be able to ground sensory perceptions (e.g., visual or haptic) with the syntax and semantic clues uttered by the human during the dialogue. using the acquired knowledge, the robot will be therefore able to manipulate objects on the basis of human-provided instructions. the knowledge acquired by the robot through the human-robot interaction process and the reasoning schema are going to be represented using models whose structures are borrowed from recent studies in behavioural psychology: the student will evaluate and use such conceptual tools as probabilistic ontologies to ground knowledge expressed using the bayesian theory of subjective probability, the dempster-shafer theory and its extensions, e.g., the transferable belief model, which are typically used to manage inconsistences. the student will test and assess the developed models in a human-robot interaction scenario where a baxter dual-arm manipulator will reason upon subjective spatial knowledge. the study will involve also joint work with the japan advanced institute of science and technology (jaist), as well as interdisciplinary work with experts in computational linguistics. requirements:basic knowledge in statistics and probability theory. knowledge representation and reasoning. software development in c/c++. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 5:approximate methods for active identification description:the research will focus on system identification methods with particular attention to the role of the control action to improve (on line) the performance in terms of identification accuracy over a finite time or time. as for the system model, the so-called ?black box? paradigm will be addressed. no specific structure for the system to be identified will be assumed. the use of parametrized approximation structures will be addressed whose complexity could be tuned a priori in order to reach a suitable trade-off between model accuracy and online computational requirement. the parameters of the approximating structure will be tuned on line, when the control action will be used in order to improve the achieved model accuracy. different control methods will be addressed, based on parameterization of the control laws as well as on approximate optimization methods. requirements:system identification. machine learning. optimal control. contacts: marco baglietto <mailto: marco.baglietto at unige.it> => theme 6:cooperative robotics for the smart factory description:the application of robots within manufacturing industries dates back form the seventies and now represents a well-consolidated field of application. most of its successes could however be achieved by exploiting the possibility of generally having the robot working within well structured environments, even if rigid and therefore very much lacking of flexibility, where very many, if not all, of the robot operations could be planned in advance in their very details; and then executed with the required precision levels. accordingly with the horizon 2020 strategic research agenda (sra) and related multi annual roadmap (mra) (but see also the recently launched european challenge euroc) all a set of challenges for the future factories have been therefore foreseen, also including the following important topics, by the way also addressing the specific needs of sme manufacturers: - cost effectiveness at low lot sizes, - intuitive to be used, - easily adaptable to a wide variety of application tasks, - easily reconfigurable modular kinematic structures, - modular kinematic structures intrinsically exhibiting self-organizing properties (in terms of their reconfiguration and relevant motion control), - exhibiting cooperation capabilities (with other robotic agents, as well as with humans during manipulation, assembly, transportation, etc.). the proposed phd program will address the last four of the above listed topics, by basing the activities concerning real time control and adaptation of the involved structures (mainly the self organization of modular robotic structures and cooperation capabilities) on some recent research results; clearly indicating the possibility of managing the mentioned topics within the same uniform, distributed and even decentralized, real time functional and algorithmic architectures. progresses in this direction are therefore expected as outputs of the phd program; to be then experimented, for some typical manufacturing problems, within a strict integration with the higher levels of planning, decision and command, whose shift toward more abstract and simplified symbolic representation should actually be allowed, in the light of the expected real time control and adaptation results. to the above aims the phd program will exploit different hardware resources for its experimental results; namely a crawler mobile manipulator for outdoor environments, two youbot platforms and a baxter bi-manual robotic system. requirements:mechatronics. multi-body kinematics and dynamicstheory. robotics. the candidates must also have: strong programming skills (c/c++, matlab/simulink); attitude to problem solving, to conduct experiments, and finally be motivated to work within a research team in collaborative projects. contacts: giuseppe casalino <mailto: giuseppe.casalino at unige.it>"

 robotics is a rapidly evolving technology that allows for fast, low-risk  and low-cost tasks with a worldwide market of over 80 billion dollars  over the next few years. in particular, aerial robots, also known as  drones, provide a breakthrough to easily image and access all sorts of  terrains and situations and are useful for instance in surveillance and  forensics, emergency industrial inspection or a search and rescue  operation. a major difficulty for their global acceptance is the  difficulty for controlling their flight and interacting with them. indeed, aerial robots are generally operated using a (central) ground  station which is not compatible with the time pressure required by  emergency conditions, for instance when rescuing a person out of reach with the ground station. this phd project  aims at concealing such obstacles and construct an aerial robot which is  able to be autonomously and interactively controlled by simple human  gestures, for instance that of a rescuer. the main scientific challenges  are (i) to embed in the aerial robot all the electronics for the visual  system from the retina to the control signals to the propellers, (ii) to  very quickly recognize a variety of simple gestures on-board using a  neuromimetic architecture and (iii) to make the robot react in real time  to these gestures. as such, this project is inter-disciplinary by  positively combining advanced algorithms from event-based bio-inspired  computer vision and the latest technology in aerial robots. first, the project will aim at using bio-inspired methods to remove the  three mentioned obstacles. biological vision, contrary to conventional  processing, is not using frame-based information or clock-based  processing. indeed, it is computationally more efficient to take full  advantage of the dynamic nature of the visual scene: biological vision  is relying on neurones working in parallel networks and coding the  spatio-temporal information of the visual scene into asynchronous spike  trains. thus, biological visual processing, starting at the retina, is  totally asynchronous and event-driven, and their artificial counterparts  can be efficiently modelled [1]. event-based dynamic vision provide a  novel and efficient way for encoding light and its temporal variations  by registering and transmitting only the changes when they occur.  neuromorphic vision sensors mimic biological visual processing by using  an array of interconnected neurons to simulate the neural network [2]  and such systems can output dynamic decision making signals which can be  used to steer the propellers. second, we intend to detect simple human gestures based on the semaphore  system which is based on characteristic hand and body movements. these  are well adapted as they are simple, fast and efficient to categorize  thanks to their unique spatio-temporal signatures. previous authors used  computationally intensive frame-based visual processing and classifiers  to recognize patterns made with different face poses and hand gestures  onboard uavs [3]. differently, we hypothesize that dynamic human  gestures contain characteristic statistics with respect to still images  such that they are more easy to categorize within these neuromimetic  systems. as a consequence, the present phd proposal will provide with a method to  control an aerial robot with hand and body gesture using a bio-inspired  asynchronous electronic architecture. we will first design the  neuromorphic retina able to generate spikes adapted to gesture vision.  then, the phd project will focus on signal processing methods to  identify human presence and associate efficiently series of spikes to  its body movement. the electronic architecture processing the visual  signals will be strongly inspired by the architecture of neural  networks, and therefore will be preferably using clock-less  microcontrollers (such as the

collaboration between sintef ocean, sintef digital, ntnu department of engineering cybernetics and the center of excellence of autonomous marine operations and systems (ntnu-amos), and focuses on the spatial and temporal dynamics of particle dispersal from oil drilling, and methods and technology for observing the ecosystem. to adequately sample the local environment, this project calls for a swarm of autonomous mobile measurement platforms (including autonomous underwater vehicles or auvs) equipped with sensors measuring current, hydrography and suspended particle content utilizing adaptive sampling strategies. the interaction between the auvs and a shore/ship-based decision support system requires acoustic communication. indorse aims to achieve its objectives through 1) analysing the dynamics of the dispersal of drill cuttings and how to observe it, 2) utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical models of the process, 3) analysing the feasibility and quality of acoustic communication between auvs and installations, and 4) developing, testing and demonstrating key elements of the monitoring system. the project will employ a phd student dedicated to system analysis, sampling theory and the establishment of technology requirements, and a post.doc researcher with focus on technological solutions including fully autonomous control for sampling.   the phd candidate will contribute to the project within the following areas: system analysis: analysis of the dynamical system (ocean dynamics, release, particle size distributions, transport and settling of material): temporal development, spatial extent and shape of the area of interest. this work will utilize existing mathematical model systems as simulation and test environment. sampling theory: adaptive sampling strategies for drilling scenarios, focusing on what features need to be observed at which spatial resolution to observe the system. use of simplified models through machine learning, and optimization based methods for path planning to maximize expected information value from measurements. establish methods to find optimal sampling strategies. technology requirements: establish methods to calculate the demands put by the system to be observed on the number of observation platforms, their performance and their sensor packages. job advertisement:

year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official

91,2017,"phd openings in biomechatronics lab.  ozyegin university, istanbul turkey"," biomechatronics laboratory in ozyegin university, istanbul has 3 funded phd openings with a start in fall (september) 2017 for those who have profound interest in both fundamental and applied robotics research. we are looking for highly motivated candidates with an msc in appropriate engineering disciplines. candidates should be willing to play leading key roles in the following high-risk high pay-off projects. project 1: comrade: a *co*llaborative *m*obile *r*obot *a*rm that learns impe*d*anc*e* critical tasks from humans funded by: eu h2020 msca project info: currently, fixed base industrial robot arms are extensively employed in factories. although these systems perform given tasks in an agile and dexterous manner, they only operate in robot-specific special environments where the robots are statically placed in a caged cell and continuously repeat carefully pre-engineered actions. as expected, they remain stationary for decades and cannot be easily reconfigurable; thus, decreasing the degree of transformability in production lines. considering the fact that industrial manufacturing experiences a paradigm shift from mass production to mass customization, current-day factories must improve the reconfigurability aspect of automated manufacturing lines. in response to this matter, the 4th industry revolution, industry 4.0, dictates the use of multi-tasking non-stationary robots which should safely work in human environments that require no robot-specific arrangements. it is also anticipated that the robot must possess cognitive abilities so as to learn certain tasks from humans with no engineering expertise. research theme [eu1]: whole-body motion control of a mobile manipulator: appropriate candidate background:  master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the student will be implementing whole body motion control techniques (e.g. [1]) that synergistically combine the omni-wheeled mobile base motion with the multi-dof manipulator (ur-3), while the robot tool is physically interacting with the environment. the robot should be able to mechanically transparent (zero-impedance) [2] for interference-free human-robot physical interaction. research theme [eu2]: human-to-robot skill transfer for the impedance-critic task execution appropriate candidate background: master degree in computer science, strong background in machine learning, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. knowledge on fundamentals of robot manipulators is a plus. the student will develop new algorithms that enables a mobile manipulator to effectively learn impedance critical tasks (drilling, screwing, etc.) by means of physical interactions with a human and acquire human?s abilities via human-to-robot skill transfer for subsequent autonomous task execution [3]. human-in-the-loop robot learning will be key to this phd theme. -- project 2: development of a self-balancing and physically compliant lower body exoskeleton robot for 3d walking support funded by: tubitak (scientific and technological research council of turkey) info: the purpose of this project is to design and implement a new generation lower body exoskeleton robot that could be used to provide robot-aided walking support for those who suffer paraplegia or similar pathological lower body diseases. in line with this purpose, the main objective of this project is to develop and synergistically integrate new technologies for a novel lower body exoskeleton robot that has advanced capabilities, such as, providing 3d walking support with no auxiliary tools, active self-balancing, and possessing competent actuator units. research theme [tr1]: motion planning and real-time controller synthesis for the exoskeleton-supported paraplegia walking appropriate candidate background: master degree in mechanical / mechatronic / control / electrical engineering, strong background in dynamic system control and control theory, system modeling, dynamics, matlab, c/c++ mathematics. the state-of-the-art exoskeletons mostly actuate hip and knee joints through flexion/extension; therefore, the users must actively engage their upper body via crutches to maintain balance. recently, a self-balancing exoskeleton system (xor) was developed [4]. thus, this project will follow the footsteps of xor project, and pave the way for next generation lower body exoskeletons. -- general info: the research environment requires mastering the english language in writing, speaking and reading. gradually increasing turkish language ability will make your life more enjoyable in istanbul, but not required. biomechatronics lab. @ ?z? is a young and vibrant research group that is strongly tied to several international laboratories, e.g., toyota technological institute - japan, italian institute of technology ? italy, computational neuroscience labs. atr ?

140,2018,"phd position in humanoid robotics at  lirmm, france"," we are looking for applicants to a phd position in humanoid robotics at lirmm, france. duration: 3 years starting date: october 1st, 2018 topic ----- in the current state of the art, motions realized on humanoid robots usually alternate between fixed contacts with the environment. fixed contacts have been sufficient to describe a number of scenarios, including walking. yet, they also impose strong restrictions on the range of motions that humanoid robots can realize. imagine humans climbing a steep staircase: when a ramp is available, they are likely to keep a hand sliding on it, increasing their overall stability with the ability to squeeze the ramp whenever necessary. far from this, in current stair climbing experiments, robots are grasping the ramp at predefined locations (see e.g. references [1] and [2] below), resulting in slow and overly conservative (hence power-consuming) motions. the reason for this conservative behavior is that non-fixed contact ""modes"" (for instance, sliding contacts) are not handled by state-of-the-art humanoid controllers today. the goal of the successful phd candidate will be to develop this new capability. in this endeavor, s/he will design new contact models and control software that will be tested on the hrp-4 humanoid robot used in our lab (see e.g. our team's youtube channel [4]). about the team -------------- the idh team [4] is part of the cnrs?um montpellier laboratory of computer science, robotics, and microelectronics (lirmm), montpellier, france. it works in close collaboration with the cnrs?aist joint robotics laboratory (jrl) located in tsukuba, japan, with which frequent exchanges of people, know-how and software take place. as part of the team, the candidate will be surrounded by a group with strong expertise in humanoid motion planning and control, where we value both theoretical developments and their application to the real robot. our team collaborates closely with airbus group as part of the comanoid project [5]. in the course of the phd, the candidate will therefore interact with practical scenarios expected to have a strong return in the years to come. profile ------- master in robotics, computer science or automation with strong programming skills (c++ or python preferred). linux fluency is a plus. application ----------- https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__scaron.info_phd-2doffer-2ded-2d2018_&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=j9tnsjpd6alczwoevc5vzci3a3ylcn78a4pyvziq9jk&e= references ---------- [1] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal.archives-2douvertes.fr_hal-2d01203507_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=mvo2ogmj-dc4o1eeybvc50ffbej9ely9qxotpdu8r-c&e= [2] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal-2dlirmm.ccsd.cnrs.fr_lirmm-2d01256512_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=k2ynxpyy69ygu6wv0-zxcdjctbqgu70zqa1oi_gpfq0&e= [3] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal.archives-2douvertes.fr_hal-2d01276934_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=mz53ngod4kztdxl-ii1a3cjrocqpne8edbrh2bbqh0y&e= [4] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_channel_ucycrcw6xsxytsxon6btbf8w&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=hzezsmiwrd7yldec5p3net6zf3ifwuny-trd_npr4to&e= [5] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__comanoid.cnrs.fr&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=_eywlc3m5k9uqnyk3phnvg41p6by47434tg9nbfcoya&e= best regards, --  st?phane caron cnrs?um lirmm, montpellier, france https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__scaron.info&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=xrhzqnnifbbqz8qv31shhvxdjijrpdfbuxhfuvygbio&e="

is seeking a ph.d.  student with a strong interest in the following research topic: /robot learning task and motion planning of long-horizon (mobile)  manipulation tasks. / the? ph.d. student will work on a highly interdisciplinary topic at the  intersection of machine learning and classical robotics. following the  increasing demand for embodied ai agents that will serve as assistants  in houses, workplaces, etc., we will research how intelligent behavior  may be acquired by the continual purposeful interaction of an agent with  an environment and the induced sensorimotor experience.? our central  research question is ?how can embodied ai systems, specifically mobile  manipulator robots, acquire skills for performing long-horizon assistive  tasks in human-inhabited environments??. as planning for assistive tasks  requires impractical computational time, coupling planning with learning  methods is key to advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of mobile  manipulation. before the introduction of deep reinforcement learning,  learning methods were not able to scale well to high-dimensional  problems, thus prohibiting their use in real-world problems. irosa group  aims to create mobile manipulation robot assistants with the ability to  intelligently acquire their skills, fluently interact with humans  through handover tasks, and dynamically adapt their behavior for  accomplishing long-horizon household tasks, like the  fetch-carry-handover, in human-inhabited environments.? for long-horizon  planning, we will explore ideas from classic task and motion planning,  graph neural networks for combinatorial optimization, hierarchical  reinforcement learning, self-supervised representation learning, etc. students and researchers from the areas of robotics and robotics-related  areas including machine learning, control engineering, and computer  vision are welcome to apply. the candidates are expected to conduct  independent research and at the same time contribute to the research  topics listed above.?
