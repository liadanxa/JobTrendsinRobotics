grenoble is 600k inhabitants city right in the middle of the french  
alps. it has a very big university and at least 10% of the population  
is made of students. grenoble activity is turned toward high  
technology industry and research. its domains of excellence are  
nanotechnology, computer sciences and electronic. all mountain  
outdoors leisure are next door (the closest ski resort is 30 minutes  
from downtown).

- emotion research group
the research group (www-laplace.imag.fr) is made of 25 persons  
(permanent researchers, engineers and phd students). it is a very  
international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

74,2014,phd position in robotic rehabilitation at nanyang technological university,"compliant advanced robotic actuation powering assistive composite exoskeleton 
assistant professor lorenzo masia 
n. of available positions: 1 
intake: august 2014 

exoskeletons represent nowadays the ultimate challenge in robotics,
especially for those applications where is required a level of additional
effort for assisting a subject lacking of voluntarily control due to
neurological damage or empowering human mobility or dexterity in working
environments. despite several devices have been developed and commercialized
the diffusion of such kind of technology still remain driven by the
conventional electromechanical actuation with the intrinsic limitations of
power consumption, safety and power-weight ratio. the project aims to
provide innovative solutions and overcome the aforementioned limitations by
introducing a new concept of actuation technology based on a novel
generation of adaptive/multifunctional structures working in
elastically-nonlinear regimes and providing an unconventional approach that
merges modern mechatronic technology and theory of composite materials. the
ambition is to challenge current design principles, deliver new ones and
create novel paradigms for control robustness by addressing the development
and use of safe, energy-efficient and highly dynamic non-linear actuation
systems based on multistable composite structures. this will permit the
embodiment of natural characteristics found in biological systems, into the
structures of a new generation of mechatronic assistive/augmenting devices
with the possibility to finely modulate and to predict the mechanical
impedance of composite material structures. the unconventional design of a
novel actuated mechanism using the tunable compliance of the carbon fiber
reinforced laminates will allow to downsize the electromechanical
counterpart and consequently the power requirements.       
the present research theme aims to coordinate a multidisciplinary approach
to the develop and use of compliant robotic technology and multistable
composite structures for a new concept of actuation for assistive augmenting
technology: the candidate will be required to design and characterize the
actuators and develop assistive technology based on the proposed concept to
assist/empower human motor performance. the project will be broken down into
the following steps: conceptual design and simulation of new hardware;
mechanical design and assembly of the system; characterization and control
of the device and experimental trials on humans. 
the research student scholarship will be provided by intelligent systems
center of nanyang technological university (singapore) and st engineering
today one of asia's largest defense and engineering groups (round the world
more than 22,000 employees).  
requirements: we are preferably seeking candidates with a background in
mechanical/aerospace engineering and/or robotics. 
the ideal candidate will be familiar with control engineering, robotics,
mechanical measurements and instrumentation, biomechanics, structural
engineering and/or theoretical understanding and practical knowledge of
advanced composite materials. 
he/she will have generic mechanical engineering skills such as manual skills
for hardware assembly, strong experience in cad mechanical design,

81,2014,phd position in robotic rehabilitation at ntu singapore,"direct modulation of brain plasticity after stroke by the synergistic action
of robot aided rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation

the main focus of the project is to develop a novel paradigm to boost motor
recovery through targeted manipulation of brain activity via the coordinated
effort of non-invasive brain stimulation (nibs) and robot aided
rehabilitation (rar). the present proposed research aims to drastically
change the present understanding of human/robot interaction and
rehabilitation: the goal is to produce a new physical substrate for
rehabilitation and assistive technology with higher levels of embedded
intelligence and a direct intervention on brain plasticity. the application
of brain stimulation after stroke is mainly based on the concept of tipping
the balance between the hemispheres to recover the lost balance. recent
findings suggested that inhibition of the hyper excitability of the motor
cortex in the unaffected hemisphere by the application of repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms), may help to improve recovery of
functions of the affected limb after stroke. we want to propose a combined
approach using rar coupled with nibs: scope of the phd studentâs work is to
use and refine our existing high performance robotic devices, for wrist and
hand manipulation, to implement therapeutic exercises with the synchronized
application of nibs and consequently manipulating the plasticity of the two
hemispheres on stroke subjects during the acute phase of the recovery
process. by introducing extensive clinical trials in collaboration with nuh
(national university hospital, nus, singapore), the final goal is to equip
clinicians with a novel rehabilitation technology and a more efficient and
targeted paradigm to qualify and quantify the different components of motor
recovery in those patients treated by rar and nibs techniques.
prospective applicants with interest in the project are encouraged to
contact the supervisor and/or the co-supervisors directly, before making a
formal application.

82,2014,"phd position in robotics/biomechanics at ntu, singapore","one fully-funded phd position (4 years) is available at the school of
mechanical and aerospace engineering, ntu, singapore. the position
description is below. note however that the successful candidate will
enjoy a large freedom of research (and also an attentive guidance by the
supervisers).

*biomechanics of running : a robotics perspective*

the objective of this thesis is to provide a novel understanding of the
interaction between the foot and the ground during running and to build
upon this understanding to design a robotic device to test running shoes.

to reproduce the dynamics of the foot/ground interaction during human
running in a way faithful enough to fit the purpose of reliably testing
running shoes, it is necessary to understand the biomechanics of running
from a robotics perspective. for instance, a particularly important
concept for the control of robotic devices that undergo heavy
interactions with the environment is that of mechanical impedance.
indeed, the separate knowledge of the foot velocity pattern on one hand
and of the contact forces on the other is not sufficient to determine
the mechanical interaction between the foot and the ground: it is
precisely their relationship â as captured by the mechanical impedance â
that matters if one is to build a robotic device that aims at
reproducing this mechanical interaction. note also that this mechanical
impedance should not be understood only at the foot/ground interaction,
but also throughout the whole ârobotic legâ.

the first part of the proposed phd thesis will consist in the study â
through both experiments and simulations â of the foot/ground
interaction and of the dynamics of the whole leg during contact, in
light of concepts arising from robotics, such as that of mechanical
impedance mentioned above. the second part will consist in the faithful
reproduction of the foot/ground interaction through the design of a
novel robotic device based on the knowledge gained in the first part. we
believe that such a program can bring about a novel understanding of the
biomechanics of running, as well as a new shoes-testing device able to
reproduce the foot/ground interaction at a level of fidelity that no
existing apparatus can reach.

finally, the results obtained in the first part can also be used in
other sport contexts which involve heavy interactions between human
limbs and the environment, such as arm/racket/ball interaction in tennis
or foot/ball interaction in football.

*requirements*

we are seeking candidates with a master or bachelor degree in
engineering (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, computer science,
biomedical), physiology, physics or mathematics. familiarity with
concepts from biomechanics, mechanical design, control theory or
robotics would be appreciated, but we are interested above all in
students with sharp critical reasoning and strong background in mathematics.

less adequate in finesse finishing, e.g. edge-finishing for aerofoil, which
still relies on expert human operators. from this perspective, we wish to
investigate the benefits of impedance control to finesse finishing tasks and
possibly devise ad-hoc end-of-arm tooling to implement such schemes.

as captured by the mechanical impedance ? that matters if one is to build a robotic device that aims at reproducing this mechanical interaction. note also that this mechanical impedance should not be understood only at the foot/ground interaction, but also throughout the whole ?robotic leg?. the first part of the proposed phd thesis will consist in the study ? through both experiments and simulations ? of the foot/ground interaction and of the dynamics of the whole leg during contact, in light of concepts arising from robotics, such as that of mechanical impedance mentioned above. the second part will consist in the faithful reproduction of the foot/ground interaction through the design of a novel robotic device based on the knowledge gained in the first part. we believe that such a program can bring about a novel understanding of the biomechanics of running, as well as a new shoes-testing device able to reproduce the foot/ground interaction at a level of fidelity that no existing apparatus can reach. finally, the results obtained in the first part can also be used in other sport contexts which involve heavy interactions between human limbs and the environment, such as arm/racket/ball interaction in tennis or foot/ball interaction in football. *requirements* we are seeking candidates with a master or bachelor degree in engineering (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, computer science, biomedical), physiology, physics or mathematics. familiarity with concepts from biomechanics, mechanical design, control theory or robotics would be appreciated, but we are interested above all in students with sharp critical reasoning and strong background in mathematics. *about the position* this phd will be conducted at the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering (http://www.mae.ntu.edu.sg/) and the institute for sports research (http://www.isr.ntu.edu.sg/), ntu, singapore, under the supervision of assistant professor pham quang cuong (http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/cuong/) and the co-supervision of assistant professor lorenzo masia (http://www.lorenzomasia.info/). it will be funded by an ntu research scholarships (http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/graduate/scholarships/pages/researchscholarship.aspx) and should start by january 2015. interested candidates are invited to send a cv and two of their most significant publications (if applicable) to cuong at ntu.edu.sg preferably before october 1st 2014. --  quang-cuong pham www.normalesup.org/~pham"

150,2015,"phd position available in soft  exoskeleton for upper limb assistance/augmentation at nanyang technological  university (ntu, singapore)"," phd position available in soft exoskeleton for upper limb assistance/augmentation at nanyang technological university (ntu, singapore) robotic exoskeletons have been developed for a large number of applications and now they represent the new frontiers in human augmentation and assistive devices. such kind of technology is mainly devoted to assist in activities of daily living or rehabilitation for people who suffer from neurological impairments of spinal cord injuries. exoskeletons have been extensively designed for walking assistance, with stationary solutions, mounted over treadmill in hospitals and used to provide gait and retraining or rehabilitation. all these solutions were mainly focused on lower limb, while for the upper limb assistance at present few effective devices have been developed. the reason can be found in the complexity of the actions that a human arm/hand must perform, starting form a simple movement of the shoulder which involves multiple degrees of freedom, to a series of complex manipulation of objects that are usually made by using the hands. that's why the technologies for upper limb rehabilitation are bulky systems, usually designed for mobilization of elbow and shoulder, and deployed in hospitals for constrained induced motion therapy.  the present project aims at designing a new concept of assistive devices based on soft materials. the use of the system will be mainly devoted to provide assistance to arm movement for elders or neurologically impaired subjects, lacking of capacity of motion and arm/hand dexterity. assisting individuals, able-bodied or patients with partial impairments poses particular challenges, especially when using robotic devices or exoskeletons. to work toward these goals, we propose a new paradigm in assistive device design, which we call soft clothing-like exosuits. these are devices that use textiles to interface with the body and apply joint torques via tensile forces over the outside of the body in parallel with the muscles, using the bone structure to support compressive loads. the scope of the project is merging two main expertise in mechatronics and smart clothing design and to develop a new wearable exoskeleton for human assistance. furthermore the exoskeleton (or exosuit) will be powered by a novel generation of actuators based on tendon driven transmission which will be integrated in the textiles such as  new sensing technology using carbon nanotubes to detect muscles activity and motion from the user.  the long goal is to create a portable wearable exosuit that assists or augments people with disabilities and lack of muscular control, by providing assistance and reducing metabolic expenditure when carrying or manipulating a load during activities of daily living.  the candidate will be enrolled in a vibrant and multidisciplinary environment and she/he will be asked to join the team working on the project by providing inputs and improvements in the design and characterization of the device, for both the engineering counterpart and the research related to smart wearable textiles. more specifically we aim at designing a new kind of device made by intelligent garments which will embed wearable instrumentations such as conductive materials, electromyography and biosignal sensors in general, and will allow to have a product based on high tech solutions, simplicity and superior ergonomics compared on pre-existing works your profile: we are looking for excellent applicants with a bachelor or master degree in mechanical engineering, robotics, computer science, applied mathematics, materials science or a related area of study, who are motivated to carry out internationally leading research.  knowledge in one or more of the following topics is mandatory: robotics and mechatronics, control design, computer-aided design (cad), computational structural mechanics, computational design, applied computing and applied artificial intelligence. what we are offering: the phd positions are fully funded with a competitive salary (tuition fee is covered by ntu). you will be part of a highly motivated, international team at one of the most competitive universities in asia and in the world. besides working in our growing, ambitious team you will also have the chance to collaborate with numerous faculty, other labs and industrial partners co-funding the project. intakes: phd starting date january 2016, application deadline is 30th june 2015. phd starting date august 2016, application starts after 15th july 2015. application: please contact at first asst prof lorenzo masia for further info by email: lorenzo.masia at ntu.edu.sg how to apply: ?

312,2017,"phd opening in soft exoskeleton for  upper limb assistance/augmentation at nanyang technological university,  singapore"," robotic exoskeletons have been developed for a large number of applications and now represent the new frontier in human augmentation and assistance. such technology is mainly devoted to assist in activities of daily living or rehabilitation for people who suffer from neurological impairments or spinal cord injuries.  exoskeletons have been extensively designed for walking assistance, with stationary systems, mounted over treadmill in hospitals and used to provide gait and retraining or rehabilitation. all these solutions are mainly focused on the lower limbs, while for the upper limb assistance at present few effective devices have been developed. the reason can be found in the complexity of the actions that a human arm/hand must perform, starting from a simple movement of the shoulder which involves multiple degrees of freedom, to complex manipulation of objects with the hands. that's why the existing technologies for upper limb rehabilitation are bulky systems, usually designed for mobilization of elbow and shoulder, and deployed in hospitals for constrained induced motion therapy.  the present project aims at designing a new concept of assistive devices based on soft materials. the use of the system will be mainly devoted to provide assistance to arm movement for elders or neurologically impaired subjects, lacking of capacity of motion and arm/hand dexterity. assisting individuals, able-bodied or patients with partial impairments poses particular challenges, especially when using robotic devices or exoskeletons. to work toward these goals, we propose a new paradigm in assistive device design, which we call soft clothing-like exosuits. these are devices that use textiles to interface with the body and apply joint torques via tensile forces over the outside of the body in parallel with the muscles, using the bone structure to support compressive loads.  the scope of the project is merging two main expertise in mechatronics and smart clothing design to develop a new wearable exoskeleton for human assistance. the exoskeleton (or exosuit) will be powered by a novel generation of actuators based on a tendon-driven transmission which will be integrated in the textiles and new sensing technology using carbon nanotubes to detect muscles activity and motion from the user.  the long goal is to create a portable wearable exosuit that assists or augments people with disabilities and lack of muscular control, by providing assistance and reducing metabolic expenditure when carrying or manipulating a load during activities of daily living.  the candidate will be enrolled in a vibrant and multidisciplinary environment and she/he will be asked to join the team working on the project by providing inputs and improvements in the design and characterization of the device, for both the engineering counterpart and the research related to smart wearable textiles.   *your profile*: we are looking for excellent applicants with a bachelor or master degree in mechanical engineering, robotics, computer science, applied mathematics, materials science or a related area of study, who are motivated to carry out internationally leading research.  knowledge in one or more of the following topics is mandatory: robotics and mechatronics, control design, computer-aided design (cad), computational structural mechanics, computational design, applied computing and applied artificial intelligence.  *what we are offering*: the phd positions are fully funded with a competitive salary (tuition fee is covered by ntu). you will be part of a highly motivated, international team at one of the most competitive universities in asia and in the world. besides working in our growing, ambitious team you will also have the chance to collaborate with numerous faculty, other labs and industrial partners co-funding the project.  intakes:  phd starting date august 2017 or january 2018.  application: please contact at first *asst prof lorenzo masia* for further info by email: lorenzo.masia at ntu.edu.sg -- view this message in context: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__robotics-2dworldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com_robotics-2dworldwide-2djobs-2dphd-2dopening-2din-2dsoft-2dexoskeleton-2dfor-2dupper-2dlimb-2dassistance-2daugmentation-2dat-2dnae-2dtp5716715.html&d=dwicag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=obuv1p8kavqjf27jpfqwtp9fvc2lgy99v8i2m5znrcq&s=mxgutngincprbzxzjonzvu5uqfyubdf8tfdudllm0i0&e=  sent from the robotics-worldwide mailing list archive at nabble.com."
