2,2010,postdoc position: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment,"development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera 
in soc environment

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.
in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.
the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.
in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

we are seeking candidates with an msc degree in mechanical engineering, mechatronics, or a related discipline, with a strong background in mechanical design, robotics and controls. good programming skills, previous experience in real-time control and human-machine interaction are a plus. if you are an integrative personality with good communication skills desiring to advance this topic with your independent working style, we are looking forward to your application.

how to apply
applications should be sent by e-mail to roger gassert (gassertr at ethz.ch) and include a statement of interest, full cv with photograph, academic transcripts and contact information of two referees.

about the rehabilitation engineering lab
the rehabilitation engineering lab pursues research at the frontiers of human-machine interaction and neuroscience, using robotic interfaces and non-invasive brain imaging as tools to investigate the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control and recovery after neurological injury, and explores how the gained insights could be applied to novel modes of diagnostics, therapy and assistance. research focuses on the design, control and (clinical) evaluation/application of robotic tools to investigate, model, restore and augment sensorimotor control in humans.

2) phd position: multimodal upper limb assistance in patients with neurological motor deficits
**********************************************************************************************************************************

within the mundus (multimodal neuroprosthesis for daily upper limb support) eu project, a highly modular framework is being developed to assist patients with upper extremity motor deficits due to neurodegenerative diseases or high-level spinal cord injury. assistive components include a portable exoskeleton to compensate for the weight of the arm, functional electrical stimulation for arm and hand, and a robotic wrist/hand actuation. the assistance will be controlled by intention-detection algorithms for which a range of modalities will be investigated: intelligent objects, surface emg, head/gaze tracking, and/or a brain computer interface.

in this context eth zurich and hocoma are offering a phd position in the field of rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology focusing on the ""integration and control of a multimodal assistive device for upper limb support of patients with neurological motor deficits"".

the focus of this project is to design and implement a portable exoskeleton by interacting with the development department at hocoma and project partners at eth zurich, as well as in austria, germany, and italy. within your studies you will develop an integrated, modular control concept for the assistive mundus platform and explore the application of these novel technologies also to upper extremity rehabilitation research.

your main work will be carried out at hocoma, while the scientific guidance and phd administration will be accompanied by the rehabilitation engineering lab at eth zurich headed by professor roger gassert in collaboration with the neuroprosthesis control group (professor silvestro micera) at the automatic control lab at eth zurich.

your profile
we are looking for candidates with an msc degree in mechanical engineering, mechatronics, or a related discipline, with solid knowledge in control systems (experience with real-time hardware-in-the-loop systems is a plus) and basic knowledge in electronics. furthermore, specific experience
in mechanical design (cad) would be a plus.
if you are an integrative personality with good communication skills (fluent in english, german is preferable) and willing to push on this interesting project with your independent working style, we are looking forward to your application.

the white paper can address all three aspects or focus  on one of them. the white paper much include: * name, affiliation, email address * a (max) 1.5 page position statement please submit  the white paper as regular text or as a pdf file. too  long white papers will be discarded. position papers that focus on  current research are not appropriate. a white paper should present a  future vision and not merely discuss state of the art. white papers should be submitted by **end of the day august 15** to   roadmapping at robotics-vo.org. late submissions may not be considered. we  will evaluate submitted white papers by 18 august and select people for  the workshops by 19 august. the workshop reports will use used as the basis for a synthesis of a new  roadmap. the nominal timeline is * august 2019 - call for white papers * sep - nov 2019 - workshops * dec 2019 - workshops reports finalized * jan 2020 - synthesis meeting @ ucsd * feb 2020 - publish draft roadmap for community feedback * apr 2020 - revision of roadmap based on community feedback * may 2020 - finalize roadmap with graphics design, ?
