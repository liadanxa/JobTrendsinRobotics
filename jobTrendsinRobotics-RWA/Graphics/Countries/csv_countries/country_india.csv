--------------------------------

- grenoble
grenoble is 600k inhabitants city right in the middle of the french  
alps. it has a very big university and at least 10% of the population  
is made of students. grenoble activity is turned toward high  
technology industry and research. its domains of excellence are  
nanotechnology, computer sciences and electronic. all mountain  
outdoors leisure are next door (the closest ski resort is 30 minutes  
from downtown).

- emotion research group
the research group (www-laplace.imag.fr) is made of 25 persons  
(permanent researchers, engineers and phd students). it is a very  
international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

14,2016,phd position in medical microrobotics  at lirmm (montpellier) and icube (strasbourg) france," applications are invited for a fully funded phd position (36 months) in  medical microrobotics in france. students with a strong background in mechanical engineering, compliant  mechanisms or microrobotics are encouraged to apply. topic ------- microrobotic systems for diagnosis and gastrointestinal therapies context ----------- since the appearance of the first endoscopic capsules for the  observation of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, a lot of work has been  done to increase the performance of these devices by giving them new  functions [1].  initially as mere inert capsules, these systems have  evolved gradually into real micro-robots with new functions as  locomotion and in situ intervention (drug delivery, biopsies, sample  extraction, etc.). however, the fabricated prototypes are generally  designed by miniaturization of mechanical principles initially thought  for conventional-size robots, which leads to major difficulties in  clinical operations. the recent development of 3d printing processes  using biocompatible materials and progresses in microrobotics and  micro-mechanisms based on flexible structures allow considering the  development of new approaches for the design of micro-robots transiting  through or staying inside the digestive tract with a major objective:  clinical application on a large scale and at low cost. for this purpose, the lirmm (laboratoire d'informatique, de robotique et  de micro?lectronique de montpellier - umr cnrs 5506) and icube  (laboratoire des sciences de l'ing?nieur, de l'informatique et de  l'imagerie - umr 7357) propose this phd position. these two laboratories  are recognized in the field of medical robotics and in the design of  robots, and offer this thesis in the labex cami  context (computer  assisted medical interventions). the aim is to develop a new generation  of microrobots exploiting the possibilities of biocompatible additive  manufacturing (3d printing) to design and implement micro-robots based  on flexible structures for applications in diagnostic and  gastrointestinal therapies, designed in partnership with the laboratory  timc-imag (techniques de l?ing?nierie m?dicale et de la complexit? ?  informatique, math?matiques et applications de grenoble, umr cnrs 5525). ph.d. objectives ---------------------- the objectives are to study and develop new robotic solutions at the  centimeter scale to propose devices with mobility capabilities, in order  to perform motion in the gi tract, and also to perform tasks such as  delivery of active substance, sample collection, and more generally to  contribute to the diagnostic and treatment of digestive pathologies. technological developments will be mainly based on the use of 3d  printing techniques for the manufacturing of biocompatible flexible  structures. current additive manufacturing techniques offer a large  freedom in the design and they constitute a solid basis for building  miniaturized devices with a bottom-up strategy, instead of a classical  top-down process. in this latter case, robotic solutions are elaborated  from well-known solutions at the macro scale. this can be a strong  limitation with assembly or friction issues that are not encountered  with solutions developed initially at the micro scale, on which we will  rely. in other words, we intend to use design principles issued from  micro and nano robotics to develop at a meso scale robotic devices that  can be exploited in the gi tract environment and that are able to  generate sufficient forces and displacements. for this ph.d. work, the student will benefit from the expertise of the  advisors in the field of compliant mechanisms, robotic systems,  microrobotics and in medical robotics. a whole set of experimental  facilities will be available within the dexter group at lirmm and avr  group at icube, as well as apparatuses from timc-imag. the three groups  also have close interactions with the medical environment. work program -------------------- the ph.d. work will take place in montpellier and strasbourg, two very  attractive cities, at lirmm and icube, two outstanding research  environments for the development of such medical microrobots. mobility  during the 3-year program will be needed in order to develop the ph.d.  project. in a general way, the foreseen work program can be described in the  following way: -          state of art on gi robotics -          study of the gi environment and selection of relevant tasks  for the applicative context -          assessment of biocompatible 3d printing processes -          elaboration of mechanical concepts based on compliant  mechanisms for the design of meso robots -          design, integration and evaluation of new flexible structures -          design, integration and evaluation of new microrobots -          experimental assessment in lab conditions -          preclinical trials, depending on the performances obtained  during lab evaluation the time spent in montpellier and strasbourg will be defined after  discussion with the ph.d. applicant, the goal being to optimize the  interactions with scientific experts and the use of experimental  facilities on the two sites. during the 3 years,  montpellier-strasbourg-montpellier or strasbourg-montpellier sequences  can for instance be considered. applicant profile ---------------------- the ph.d. applicant needs to have a mechanical engineering or  mechatronics background. he/she will hold a m.sc.in one of these fields,  or an equivalent diploma (engineer degree). skills in the medical  robotics/compliant mechanisms would be a plus. expected beginning -------------------------- beginning of the ph.d. thesis is expected in october 2016 for 36 months. advisors ------------ yassine haddab professor, university of montpellier lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477 161 rue ada, f-34095 montpellier cedex 5 france e-mail: yassine.haddab at lirmm.fr t?l. : +33 4 67 41 85 57 pierre renaud professor, insa strasbourg avr ?
