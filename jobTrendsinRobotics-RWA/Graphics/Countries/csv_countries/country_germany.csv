as humans we can sense, act, speak, listen, decide and sometimes
understand.  the 21st century will witness technologies that can do the
same. we will see cars that negotiate with each other in order to
optimize traffic flow. our t-shirts may have their own internet
addresses and tell the manufacturer if they are only rarely worn.
in addition to their well-established role as programmable
machine-tools, robots are also more and more used in domains where
some autonomy and intelligence is necessary. they work under conditions
where the robot is not constantly supervised by a human operator and
where it has to be adaptive as its developer can not fully predict which
situations it will encounter in its application environment.

we all know future descriptions of this kind; we also know that they
are no longer science fiction, although real future may still look
quite differently. but whatever route the future takes, it will be
scientists and engineers who help in shaping it. they will develop

cotesys partners tum and lmu rank first among germany's universities,
according to a recent focus survey. 14 nobel laureates (the most recent
one of 2005 at mpi) are associated with munich (münchen). on 10/13/2006

within the eu protem project, partners from academia and industry of
various eu countries (france, germany, switzerland, uk, netherlands) are
working on a next generation storage system for archiving and backup.
the aim is to realize a 1 petabyte memory in a box as small as a dvd
drive. the technology used will be probe storage, based on the ibm probe
storage program (millipede). in this technology, an array of thousands
of 100 um sized read/write heads is reading and writing data. in the
current architecture, the storage area is limited to the size of the
array, which is restricted to about 1 cm2. within the protem project,
the storage area will be expanded to several hunderd cm2, but the array
will still be small. therefore the array has to be positioned over this
big area with high accuracy and speed.

to study, design and realize this architecture, experts from very
different fields (media, mems, system architecture) will cooperate
closely in this 4 year, 10 meu project. one of the tasks of the
university of twente in the project will be to design and realize the
positioning system. we therefore have a vacancy for a postdoctoral
researcher in the field of (micro-)mechanical modelling for the duration
of 18 months. 

your task will be to evaluate various concepts of positioning systems on
their disadvantages and merits, and determine whether the overall
specifications of the device can be reached and using what concepts. for
this, a solid background in modelling and control engineering or mems is
required. we are looking for a person with strong communication skills,
capable of operating in a large, multi-national team.

idsia is small but visible, competitive, and influential. for example, 
its ant colony optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records 
and are now widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc. (today 
entire conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the 
origin of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial 
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers. idsia's 
artificial recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous 
unlearnable sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, 
artificial evolution and other methods. research topics also include 
complexity and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and 
information theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia was the 
smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the 1997 ""x-lab 
survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth place in the 
category ""computer science - biologically inspired"". idsia's most 
important work was done after 1997 though.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of special 
relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated with 105 
nobel laureates, and boasts the world's highest number of nobel prizes 
per capita, the highest number of publications per capita, the highest 
number of patents per capita, the highest citation impact factor, the 
most cited single-author paper, etc.  switzerland also got the highest

26,2008,job opening: machine learning for interactive cognitive robots,"-------------------

job opening

the german research center for artificial intelligence (dfki gmbh) is  
seeking for its language technology lab a

                                                                                    senior 
  researcher

in the area of cognitive systems, for a research position (post-doc,  
or senior) in the eu fp7 ip ""cognitive systems that self-understand  
and self-extend"" (cogx).

the cogx project is a european project in the area of cognitive  
systems and will run from may 2008 till the end of june 2012. the  
project (which is a follow-up to the cosy project, [http://www.cognitivesystems.org 
] and [ http://cosy.dfki.de/ ] ) will have a strong emphasis on the  
theoretical and practical integration of capabilities in vision,  
manipulation, mobility, spatial cognition, planning, and dialogue  
processing. cogx will be focused on the dynamics of a system capable  
of actively extending itself to fulfill identified requirements:

""imagine a cognitive system that models not only the environment, but  
its own understanding of the environment and how this  understanding  
changes under action. it identifies gaps in its own understanding and  
then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and  
uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to  
complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to  
perform future tasks more efficiently.""

in the cognitive systems we conceive of, a wide and heterogeneous set  
of learning problems can be identified. these scenarios typically  
involve social contexts with a rich multimodal communication between  
human and robot. across these potential learning problems, the  
appropriate representations, learning models and evaluation criteria  
differ widely.

to create a unified theory that makes it possible for the robot to  
reason about its knowledge and lack thereof, and to communicate the  
essence of this reasoning, will most likely require insights from  
fields such as socially guided machine learning, traditional and novel  
forms of machine learning such as active learning, meta learning,  
human-robot interaction, and situated dialogue processing,

we are looking for an experienced researcher with a phd in computer  
science (or equivalent) to work on ""interactive continuous learning of  
crossmodal concepts"" in the cogx project. we need a person with

* a strong background in machine learning,
* preferably with experience in active learning, socially guided  
learning, interactive learning;
* preferably with experience in robotics, artificial intelligence,  
computational linguistics.
* strong analytical skills,
* strong mathematical skills,
* strong programming skills (e.g. c++, java, python),
* experience in collaborative software development (our project  
software is usually developed across 6-7 international sites, with up  
to 15 developers)
* a good command of english, spoken and written

the person will work in an international team. responsibilities will  
include leading the machine learning efforts in our group within the  
cogx project, theory development, implementation and evaluation of  
software in an integrated (robot) system. the person will be expected  
to write, or contribute to writing, scientific papers and articles set  
in the project context.

highly valued personal qualities include creativity, open-mindedness,  
team spirit, and a willingness to address novel challenges in unknown  
scientific territory.

the applicant should have a completed phd degree on commencing the job.

the earliest starting date of the position is september 2008. the  
duration of the contract will probably be until the end of the project  
(june 2012).

dfki gmbh [ http://www.dfki.de ] is located on the campus of saarland  
university in saarbrucken, germany. the university's research groups  
and curricula in the fields of computational linguistics and computer  
science are internationally renowned. the lt-lab [ http://www.dfki.de/lt/

this project is entitled ""rossi; emergence of communication in robots 
through sensorimotor and social interaction"", and focuses on the 
development of communication between robots and humans 
(http://www.rossiproject.eu).
in particular, the project is addressing the question of how critical it 
is for communicating agents to share the same general view of the world. 
  agents possessing different sensory and motor systems may have 
different views of the world and therefore may have difficulties in 
communicating. we are exploring to what extent and which aspects of 
world models must be shared in order to facilitate communication between 
robots and humans.  we wish to increase understanding of the 
requirements of affordance based world models, shared models and 
communication provided by such models, based on understanding of 
objects, actions, and processes in their environment. the focus of this 
project is the construction of robots that are able to process simple 
commands and to respond appropriately by interacting with different 
kinds of objects and entities in their environment. this project has 6 
partners in italy, germany,  sweden  and turkey, involving psychologists, 
neuroscientists, computer scientists and robotics engineers. we are 
involved in all stages but especially the implementation of the models 
in a robotic manipulation system and the testing and experimentation 
with real application tasks.

we wish to appoint a post-doctoral research associate who will take 
major responsibility for the programme of research in the context of our 
robotics team.  this post is available on a three-year fixed-term 
contract. we expect to appoint for a start date of 1 march 2008.

- applicants should have a doctorate in computer science, artificial 
intelligence, engineering, or a related scientific field, and be able to 
demonstrate research experience.
- the post requires excellent software skills for the implementation and 
running of a range of experimental components.
- the successful applicant will also be involved in writing scientific 
documents and papers and will be expected to travel and give 
presentations as necessary.

job opening
(deadline for applications: june 30 2008)

the german research center for artificial intelligence (dfki gmbh) is  
seeking for its language technology lab a

                                                                                   senior 
  researcher

in the area of cognitive systems, for a research position (post-doc,  
or senior) in the eu fp7 ip ""cognitive systems that self-understand  
and self-extend"" (cogx).

the cogx project is a european project in the area of cognitive  
systems and will run from may 2008 till the end of june 2012, [ http://cogx.eu 
  ]. the project (which is a follow-up to the cosy project, [http://www.cognitivesystems.org 
] and [ http://cosy.dfki.de/ ] ) will have a strong emphasis on the  
theoretical and practical integration of capabilities in vision,  
manipulation, mobility, spatial cognition, planning, and dialogue  
processing. cogx will be focused on the dynamics of a system capable  
of actively extending itself to fulfill identified requirements:

""imagine a cognitive system that models not only the environment, but  
its own understanding of the environment and how this  understanding  
changes under action. it identifies gaps in its own understanding and  
then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and  
uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to  
complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to  
perform future tasks more efficiently.""

in the cognitive systems we conceive of, a wide and heterogeneous set  
of learning problems can be identified. these scenarios typically  
involve social contexts with a rich multimodal communication between  
human and robot. across these potential learning problems, the  
appropriate representations, learning models and evaluation criteria  
differ widely.

to create a unified theory that makes it possible for the robot to  
reason about its knowledge and lack thereof, and to communicate the  
essence of this reasoning, will most likely require insights from  
fields such as socially guided machine learning, traditional and novel  
forms of machine learning such as active learning, meta learning,  
human-robot interaction, and situated dialogue processing,

we are looking for an experienced researcher with a phd in computer  
science (or equivalent) to work on ""interactive continuous learning of  
crossmodal concepts"" in the cogx project. we need a person with

* a strong background in machine learning,
* preferably with experience in active learning, socially guided  
learning, interactive learning;
* preferably with experience in robotics, artificial intelligence,  
computational linguistics.
* strong analytical skills,
* strong mathematical skills,
* strong programming skills (e.g. c++, java, python),
* experience in collaborative software development (our project  
software is usually developed across 6-7 international sites, with up  
to 15 developers)
* a good command of english, spoken and written

the person will work in an international team. responsibilities will  
include leading the machine learning efforts in our group within the  
cogx project, theory development, implementation and evaluation of  
software in an integrated (robot) system. the person will be expected  
to write, or contribute to writing, scientific papers and articles set  
in the project context.

highly valued personal qualities include creativity, open-mindedness,  
team spirit, and a willingness to address novel challenges in unknown  
scientific territory.

the applicant should have a completed phd degree on commencing the job.

the earliest starting date of the position is september 2008. the  
duration of the contract will probably be until the end of the project  
(june 2012).

39,2008,"postdoc position in explorative motor learning at cor-lab, bielefeld university","cor-lab at bielefeld university invites applications from outstanding
postdocs in the area of autonomous explorative motor learning

the successful candidate has a strong background in at least two of the 
areas visual servoing, dynamical systems and control, and machine 
learning. the research project will cover dimension reduction methods,
development of adaptive vision-based controllers, their evaluation in
physics-based simulations and on real robot hands, and the development 
of explorative learning strategies. the candidate should be able to
autonomously acquaint oneself with new research topics, supervise
undergraduate students, and integrate into the existing team.

research topic
humans gradually increase their manual competence by active exploration 
of the manipulation capabilities of their fingers. as compared to 
learning from sensory data, active learning incorporates the exploration 
into the skill acquisition process.
the project targets to research such active learning paradigms, and to
apply them to real-world scenarios such as object-in-hand-manipulation
with dexterous robot hands. one interesting example is to learn to 
rotate a cube so that certain faces become visible one after the other. 
the learning scheme should exploit multimodal perception, such as joint 
angle sensors, tactile sensors in the fingertips, and visual 
information, and integrate these cues with the movement control scheme 
of a dexterous 20 dof shadow robot hand. a major goal of the project 
would be to implement a vertical slice of explorative skills, ranging 
from learning low level finger control (extending eye-hand to eye-finger 
coordination) to realizing desired movement skills of an object held in 
the hand.
generic insights should be gained about how proprioceptive, visual, and 
haptic information has to be combined to drive the exploration process 
and about suitable principles for shaping the exploration. this will 
touch the research areas of reinforcement learning, active learning 
driven by information maximization, or imitation of previously learnt 
episodes.

research environment
the cor-lab has been established at bielefeld university, germany, as a
research centre for intelligent systems and human-machine interaction. 
the cor-lab forms a strategic partnership between bielefeld university 
and the honda research institute europe gmbh, germany. it pursues 
fundamental research in the field of cognitive robots and intelligent 
systems. a particular focus of the cor-lab is the interdisciplinary 
integration of expertise in engineering, computer science, brain 
science, and cognitive sciences, including the humanities and social 
sciences.
the graduate school that is associated with the cor-lab provides an
exciting and stimulating environment for 20 enthusiastic and creative 
phds and postdocs, allowing them to pursue research in international 
teams in close collaboration with an industrial research institute.

scholarship
the cor-lab offers a three-year scholarship to pursue the research goals
of the project.

for more information please see:

idsia was the smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the  
1997 ""x-lab survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth  
place in the category ""computer science - biologically inspired"".  
idsia's most important work was done after 1997 though. it is small  
but visible, competitive, and influential. its highly cited ant colony  
optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records and are now  
widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc (today entire  
conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the origin  
of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial  
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers (previous  
work on general ai was dominated by heuristics). idsia's artificial  
recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous unlearnable  
sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, artificial  
evolution and other methods. research topics also include complexity  
and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and information  
theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia's results were reviewed  
not only in science journals such as nature, science, scientific  
american, but also in numerous popular press articles in time, the ny  
times, der spiegel, etc. many tv shows on tech & science helped to  
popularize idsia's achievements.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of  
special relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated  
with 105 nobel laureates, and boasts far more nobel prizes per capita  
than any other nation. it also has the world's highest number of  
publications per capita, the highest number of patents per capita, the  
highest citation impact factor, the most cited single-author paper,  
etc, etc. switzerland also got the highest ranking in the list of  
happiest countries."

is internationally highly competitive and has led to the development of 
/runbot/, which had been for some time the fastest dynamic biped walker 
(see the internet for runbot, manoonpong et al., plos cb, 2007), 
/amos-wd6/, a hexapod which uses deterministic chaos to control its

       center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     orebro university,  sweden 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".

this position is for an immediate start, and it will be open until a
suitable candidate is found.


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.


about orebro university:

orebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university currently enrolling
more than 15,000 students.  it is located in orebro, a city of 130,000
inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the aass mobile robotics lab is one of the three research groups within
the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass).  aass carries
out multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science,
and measurement technology.  the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come from a dozen different
countries, in europe and worldwide, and have different scientific and
cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently hosts international
researchers and is involved in several international projects.  this
means, particularly in the gert project, that the enrolled phd student
will have the opportunity to travel and to cooperate with people in
other countries.

the aass mobile robotics lab is internationally renowned for its
research in cognitive robots, robot ecologies and artificial olfaction.
further information can be found at www.aass.oru.se/research/robots/.

the student will work under the joint supervision of alessandro saffiotti
and lars karlsson.  the student will receive a monthly salary adequate to
the cost of living in  sweden , and will be included in the swedish social
security system.


prerequisites and application process:

the applicant should have a strong theoretical background in computer
science, a clear interest in the research topic, and good programming
skills.  a masters or equivalent degree in computer science or computer
engineering is required.  knowledge of swedish is not required, but
proficiency in written/spoken english is mandatory.  candidates with
good experience in artificial intelligence will be preferred.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <asaffio at aass.oru.se>.  applications will be
accepted starting immediately and until a suitable candidate is found.

131,2012,public release of the robot construction kit,"the rock development team is proud to announce the official public 
release of the robot construction kit (rock).

    http://rock-robotics.org

rock is a software framework for the development of robotic systems. the 
underlying component model is based on orocos/rtt (real time toolkit). 
rock provides all the tools required to set up and run high-performance 
and reliable robotic systems for a wide variety of applications in 
research and industry. it contains a rich collection of ready-to-use 
drivers and modules for use in your own system, and can easily be 
extended by adding new components. the framework was developed to 
specifically address the following issues in existing solutions:

sustainable systems.
    the architecture and the tools in rock are designed with
    long-running systems in mind. in practice this means that for us,
    error detection, reporting and handling are key in any robotic
    architecture.

scalability.
    provide the tools to be able to manage big systems with minimum
    fuss. but we don't require you to learn about these (complex) tools
    right away: as soon as you use rock's component development tool,
    orogen, you have the guarantee that your components can be
    integrated - from simple scenarios using hard-coded c++ behaviors,
    to ruby scripts, up to the complete system monitoring tools.

reusable code-base.
    even though we think that the rock toolchain is one of the best out
    there, some other people might feel differently. and they might be
    right. that's why in rock most of the functionality – from control
    to data display through to data processing – is implemented in a way
    that is totally independent from rock's integration framework.
    that's right: just pick our drivers, localization algorithms and
    control loops and add them into your integration framework. you
    don't have to do anything on our side, as the code is completely
    independent from the integration parts.

    installation

so far, the development of the robot construction kit has been supported 
by the dfki robotics innovation center (http://www.dfki.de/robotics) in 
bremen, germany. however, it is an open platform, so feel free to join. 
most packages in the rock distribution are under an lgpl v2 or later

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

140,2012,program for the iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012),"iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012): closing the
action-perception loop
sunday october 7th 2012
vilamoura, algarve,  portugal 
url: http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/cas2012/

we gladly invite you to attend the cas2012 workshop...

it is becoming increasingly clear that future robotic systems will need to
exhibit sophisticated assistive capabilities, highly tuned and responsive
to the needs of human users. whether on autonomous platforms or within
personal computing systems, awareness of human intentions and requirements
will be an essential attribute of any robotic system aiming to be genuinely
useful. in essence, they will need to be capable of empathising with human
behaviour if they are to be truly assistive in the fullest sense of the
word.

realising such cognitive assistive systems (cas) will require advances
along the complete processing pipeline, from sensing through to learning
and interaction. for instance, sensing will need to be proactive,
anticipating user actions and environment changes to optimise data capture;
whilst learning will need to exploit knowledge gained from observation of
past actions and behaviours to predict likely human responses and reactions
under different scenarios. during task-performance, assistive systems need
to predict the perceptual changes that result as a consequence of human
actions. these are challenging tasks which are likely to require step
changes in current state of the art capability if they are to be addressed.

the aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from relevant
disciplines to exchange ideas and results on these and related tasks, as
well as on the form of existing and future cognitive assistive systems.
this will include those working in sensing, such as speech and vision,
machine learning and ai, human computer interaction, biomechanics, and on
systems and applications, including autonomous platforms, sensor networks
and wearable computing, for example. one area in which ca systems are
likely to have significant impact is in industrial manufacturing and
training, and applications in this area will be of particular interest for
this workshop.

steerable catheters and sheaths for endovascular interventions are 
commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrophysiological 
cardiac disorders, and are finding increasing applications in structural 
heart repair. as the range of clinical procedures increases, so does the 
demand for accurate and flexible tip steering. conventional steerable 
tools have a fixed bending region, but in many cases it is desirable to 
be able to choose the bending region or even to have 2 independently 
controlled bending regions to enable control of the tip angle and tip 
location independently. this ph. d. work will consist of design, 
modeling, fabrication, and evaluation of disposable snake robot 
mechanisms for endovascular tools.

this will require good mechatronics, fabrication, and materials 
understanding. you will be collaborating with a team of experienced 
scientists and engineers from the mimed institute (prof. lüth) at tum 
and the micro structures integration group at ge. you will have unique 
access to the latest rapid prototyping hardware, as well as an extensive

permanent monitoring of the human’s multimodal conduct, incremental 
processing of perception as well as incremental action generation, the 
realization of repair strategies for human-robot interaction and 
empirically based perception-action loops. the position will target the 
development of the required coordination model based on a rich 
repertoire of existing perceptual and action modules, e.g., for person 
tracking, speaker localization, focus of attention recognition or 
incremental text-to-speech production. the successful candidate develops 
architectural concepts for interactive robotic systems facilitating 
incremental processing of multi-modal perceptual cues and generation of 
communicative actions exploiting context-dependent priors on the 
behavior of human interaction partners.

the candidate is expected to collaborate with the interdisciplinary 
project partners on the analysis and experimental targets of the overall

phd fellowship

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional

===========================================================================

description: realizing proficient human robot collaboration is a fundamental
challenge for robotics and in recent years it is becoming more and more
central, as robots use becomes more pervasive in society. in particular, an
important question is how to translate humans’ social skills into
human-robot interaction. we suggest that the efficient human mutual
understanding relies substantially on the implicit, non-verbal communication
associated to human motion (1, 2, 3). our approach aims at understanding
which robotic features promote natural and fluid human-robot interaction,
using robots both as tools to investigate human brain functions and as test
bed for the derived models. currently we are testing the motor and
perceptual principles usually adopted in human collaboration - as goal
anticipation (4, 5), automatic imitation (5), context-dependent perception
(6), weight understanding from action observation (7,8) - during human-robot
interaction experiments with the icub platform. the topic we propose as phd
activity is to further investigate how to establish efficient human - robot
collaboration by exploiting the natural mechanisms in place for human
interaction. the research will be based on designing different human-robot
interactive scenarios and assessing the efficiency of the collaboration and
the acceptance by the user, by means of multiple techniques, as
eye-tracking, motion capture and force measurements. the successful
candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the
osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie
curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her
knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes. 

requirements: background in computer sciences, robotics, computational or
behavioral neurosciences is required, as also willingness to make
experiments with human participants and strong motivation to work and adapt
to a multidisciplinary environment.

description: social skills play a fundamental role since the very early
development stages. infants present a marked inclination for social
interaction, ranging from the preference for biological motion and mutual
gaze to imitation of facial expressions and auditory, oral, and motor
matching. such social inclination is supported by the gradual evolution of
the production and understanding of social signals, such as gestures, gaze
direction and emotional displays. to gain a deeper understanding of this
crucial stage of human development our goal is to design models of the
perceptual primitives supporting the acquisition of social skills in infants
and to test them on a humanoid robot. computer vision and machine learning
state-of-the-art methods will be the building blocks of the research to be
carried out. 

requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer
engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving. a
background on computer vision is an asset.

topic: embodied cognitive modeling of language processing and dialogue 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

we are seeking highly qualified candidates who want to participate as a phd student researcher in a larger scale project at bielefeld university's center of excellence on cognitive interaction technology (citec) [1,2]. the project aims to investigate how a robot can familiarize itself with novel objects and actions through exploratory manual interaction in its environment under guidance of a human tutor. the goal is to develop deep representations of objects and actions, using language to engage in dialogue with the tutor to guide the ongoing interaction and familiarization process. language processing and dialogue shall thereby be grounded in embodied cognitive processes.

in particular, we are searching for a phd student working on the language aspects of this project. the task is to build a cognitively motivated representation system which interconnects different levels of abstraction and is grounded in the (already present) lower-level sensorimotor capabilities of the robot. the researcher will have to develop an intermediate type of conceptual representation which should be based on or is connected to schema theories and should in particular focus on dynamic representation of action. the targeted outcome is an implemented formalism for action semantics that links up lower-levels of sensorimotor processing with linguistic processing of syntax and semantics, as e.g. provided by construction grammar based approaches. a second goal is to build dialogue strategies on top of this formalism, e.g. to enable clarification questions geared to reduce uncertainty in this mental simulation.

the successful candidate has a background in cognitive science/a.i. and linguistics, and is in particular familiar with, or motivated to learn about a deep understanding of cognition within holistic approaches to complex embodied cognitive systems. knowledge on cognitive linguistic formalism and schema theory will be helpful.

192,2013,postdoc opening at lirmm montpellier: design of safety compliant behavior for humanoids in haptic interaction,"laboratory: lirmm (cnrs/university montpellier 2), montpellier, france
department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of safety compliant behavior for humanoids in haptic interaction   


in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program active compliance behaviors of a humanoid robot in haptic interaction with the environment or a human. tasks carried out in contact with the environment or humans call de-facto for safety issues. not only should the human partner not be harmed in any situation, but the robot must also ensure its own safety (since the human can be a strong source of perturbation to the robot). this challenging problem is of prime importance. while studies in particular at dlr in germany have considered this issue in previous (phriends, viactors) and current (saphari) european projects, none of them has considered the problem of safety in human-humanoid interaction that is linked to the potential of falling with a human. of course fundamentals in terms of admissible impedance, impulse forces, compliant hardware reported in robotic safety will be considered. but additional ones, namely humanoid falling when being in close physical contact with a human, calls for a different approach in terms of reflex strategies and the control that is to be implemented in addition to non-harming contacts in direct interaction. we will investigate a set of strategies to guarantee safety of the haptic interaction in most critical circumstances. aldebaran partner will provide knowledge related to norms and standards to be considered and will use the results of this project to improve the understanding of this very new kind of man-machine interaction. a lot has been told about safety in robotics but real experiments with humanoids are still missing, and this research will bring new valid data into the discussion. in order to do so, we will identify situations where the motion is not viable (i.e. the interaction is not controllable) and having human-in-the-loop adds difficulty to this process. assuming this, we will propose taxonomy of these critical situations and devise for each a set of rules/guidelines/policies to avoid it and another set of rules/guidelines/policies to deal with it in conjunction with the available norms and standards.
 
these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assist scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organized in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

citec's goal are technical systems that are capable of cognitive 
interaction: this means the ability to interact with humans in 
situations and assist them for tasks that require some cognitive 
understanding of the context. moreover those systems need to integrate 
abilities such as shared attention, perception-guided planning and 
control of actions, situated communication and learning. given that the 
most advanced integration of such capabilities is seen in living 
systems, citec connects research groups in computer science and robotics 
with researchers and groups from biology, linguistics, mathematics, 
physics, psychology and sport science. individual groups cooperate in a 
highly interdisciplinary research institute established through the 
german excellence initiative and funded since 2007.

and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

208,2014,"phd position at the max planck institute for biological cybernetics, tuebingen, germany [jobs]","*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,

   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.

210,2014,two open phd position @ robert bosch gmbh coporate research,"in the corporate research division ""software intensive systems"" of the bosch group in stuttgart area, germany, there are currently two open phd positions in the same line of research:

1) verification of hybrid systems:

many innovations in bosch products and services are based on embedded software that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators. the correctness of the resulting system -- software interacting with its environment -- is a chief success factor.

a suitable model for such software-intensive systems is the hybrid system model that comprises continuous and discrete aspects of a system. hybrid systems allow us to model, specify and verify diverse system classes such as several industrial robots, e.g., for autonomous land mower and production assistants. thus, verification of hybrid systems is a crucial technology. the goal of this dissertation is to transfer current research results into an industrial environment with additional constraints such as scalability and integration into a development process.

- modeling (for verification) of industrial systems as hybrid systems
- analysis of different verification methods based on modeled examples
- development of techniques and methods for scalability and usability of verification methods
- connection of formal verification methods to approaches for testing and runtime monitoring

more details under: www.bosch-career.com<http://www.bosch-career.com>, reference: de00274028

2) robotic systems and software engineering

bosch offers a number of products and services in robotics, from the indego lawn mower to the apas production assistant. our robotics researchers explore several new application areas and are actively involved in a couple of public funded research projects. of course, this research is also closely connected to the extensive r&d activities on automated and autonomous driving.

amongst others, we are investigating model-based methods for robotics software development, including behavioral aspects such as decision making and task planning. model-based methods not only increase the development efficiency but also allow for early verification and thus improve the quality of robotic systems. a crucial question thereby is how to treat the inherent uncertainty of sensor data in such methods.

- advance and apply academic research results on modeling robotic system behavior with uncertainty-aware logics.
- develop a domain-specific reasoning framework for robotic applications at bosch.
- research algorithmic foundations for automatic generation of reasoning engines for real-time decision making in a safety-critical context.

----------------------
thematic:

this thesis is in the field of medical robotics and focuses on the 
development of solutions for tracking the deformations of organs using 
medical imaging devices based on scanning imaging technologies 
(ultrasound and oct). the interest is to allow future implementation of 
robotic applications for assistance during minimally invasive surgical 
procedures, such as needle insertion for biopsies, localized treatment 
of tumors [1] or in the context of minimally or non-invasive surgical 
microrobotics. to this end, taking into account tissue deformations due 
to the patient's physiological movement and physical interaction of 
surgical instruments with the targeted anatomical element is a crucial 
step to ensure a safe and effective robotic assistance [2].

----------------------
context:

ultrasound imaging and oct can provide 3d ​​images in real-time in 
opposite to magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and are not invasive for 
the patient in contrast to x-ray imaging. therefore these imaging 
modalities are well appropriated to allow biopsies and surgical 
procedures in interventional radiology [3].

3d ultrasound and oct work on a very similar principle that consists in 
sending an ultrasonic or optical infrared (for oct) wave along a scan 
line and measuring the signal that is reflected by the interfaces of 
tissue traversed by the wave. the 3d image is then reconstructed by 
automaticallysweeping the wave along successive scanning lines on the 
area of ​​interest.

however the scanning is performed sequentially thanks to an 
electronic/mechanical sweeping which produces artifacts in the 
reconstructed image in case the observed anatomical structure moves and 
deforms due to the physiological motion of the patient.
----------------------

research work:

this thesis will focus on the development of an approach able to 
compensate these artifacts by controlling the sweeping in a clever 
manner that will allow a more accurate tracking of the organ 
deformations [4]. the idea is to control the direction of each scanning 
line in order it intersects on specific points in soft tissue and to use 
the wave response time to directly estimate the motion speed of the 
anatomical structure. to this end, we plan to use a preoperative digital 
model of the targeted organ acquired by mri or ct. the deformation of 
the model will be online adapted during the intraoperative imaging 
performed with ultrasound or oct thanks to observations obtained during 
the monitored sweeping of the wave.
----------------------

expected results:

the main contribution of this thesis would be a novel approach that 
automatically performs an intraoperative registration of a deformable 
model with an observed soft tissue structure while compensating the 
artifacts induced by the scanning imaging technology.
----------------------

competence:

knowledge in computer vision and applied mathematics are required, as 
well as good programming skills in c++.

226,2014,"doctoral research position at the 	university of freiburg, germany"," the university of freiburg invites candidates to apply for a fully funded three-year phd position (tv-l e13). the job offers a novel perspective to relevant problems in robotics in an inter-disciplinary approach involving engineering, artificial intelligence / machine learning, neuroscience and assistive technology. the interaction between a (semi-autonomous) robotic device (e.g., a robotic wheelchair) and a human user is often ruled by a set of strategies executed by the robot. typical robotic tasks are to accomplish a navigation task, to map the environment or to manipulate objects of the environment. the user may either control the actions of the robot or be an interaction partner for the robot. the level of control the user has over the robot's actions can be placed on the continuum between absolute low-level control (e.g., a joystick), over mid-level control (""turn right on next occasion"") up to high-level control (""take me to the kitchen""). while state-of-the-art robotic control already takes the changing environment into account before strategies are selected and executed, the internal state of the user and fluctuations thereof typically are disregarded. examples of informative mental states of users would be the level of task-induced workload, the sense of control/agency in the current situation or the perceived complexity of the current situation. in the project, relevant internal mental states of the user shall continuously be assessed. therefore, electrophysiological recordings (e.g., eeg, meg, gsr, hrv, etc.) will be exploited with methods developed in the field of brain-computer interface (bci) systems. upon successful decoding of a mental state of interest, the robotic behavior can be adapted specifically to an individual user and to the perceived situation. using the resulting co-adaptive strategy between human and robot, we expect an enhancement of usability and user acceptance during various tasks in human-robot interaction. during the project, expected tasks will comprise offline experiments with assessment of electrophysiological signals, simulated robotic control, offline and online data analysis with bci methods, online experiments with a robotic application and mental state monitoring, evaluation of adaptive strategies of the robot. the candidate is expected to actively participate in the dissemination of research results in publications, on conferences and by teaching. the target group are candidates with a degree at master level in robotics, computer science, artificial intelligence / machine learning, electrical engineering or cognitive science, with a strong relation to science, technology or innovation studies. candidates are expected to have practical experience in all of the three fields robotics, machine learning/ai, and brain-computer interfaces. we furthermore expect outstanding qualifications, the motivation to obtain a doctoral degree and the interest to work in an interdisciplinary environment. finally we require applicants to have excellent communication skills in english. applications should be send to ais-applications at informatik.uni-freiburg.de. the application documents should consist of a single pdf file and include - motivation letter (expose, respectively) - two letters of recommendation from professors or persons authorized to supervise dissertation projects - curriculum vitae - copies of the following documents:    a. higher education entrance qualification (school-leaving certificate)    b. university examination certificates (intermediate examinations)    c. university diploma    d. any documents providing evidence of academic achievements, relevant practical experience, and qualifications earned at or outside of the university further information can be obtained from wolfram burgard and michael tangermann ({burgard|tangerm}@informatik.uni-freiburg.de)."

surgical robotic applications    description of the institution    the department of computer science of the university of  verona is looking for a highly motivated   candidate to apply for a marie sklodowska-curie individual  fellowship in the altair robotics   laboratory. the department of computer science of the  university of verona (italy) was funded in   2001 and is located in the south of verona. its main  research labs and offices are located in the   area of the medical-scientific centre of the university. the  department has several research and   teaching activities that represent a continuous of  competences from mathematics, through computer   science and computer engineering, up to physics. active  research areas are: discrete and application   mathematics, theory of computation, machine intelligence,  information systems, software engineering   and security, applied computing, cyber-physical systems,  applied and experimental condensed matter   physics. finally, the leadership of the department in  applied research and the impact on the   surrounding area are confirmed by research funding via  european, national and regional programs and   by the seven spin-offs created in the last years.  the altair robotics laboratory was founded in 2000,  concurrently with the establishment of the   courses automatic controls and robotics within the  department of computer science of the university   of verona. the main fields of exploration in the research  group range from surgical and medical   robotics, smart robotic instruments, images analysis,  virtual and augmented reality to mobile   robotics and uavs.    description of the position    the robotic group of the department of computer science  looks for an experienced researcher   (post-doc) with competences in robotics, control systems,  software development and bioinformatics,   to develop and extend projects in the field of smart  instrument design for surgical robots. the   robotics group aims at reinforcing their knowledge in this  field, by this opportunity. the post-doc   will find an environment of researchers at all levels with  whom he/she can collaborate to implement   the project.  reusability and modularity are key factors in design and  manufacturing of the next generation of   surgical instruments: smart surgical instruments.  instruments that are engineered based on   patient-specific pre-operative data designed to follow  specific access routes that cause minimal or   zero trauma, that are inherently compliant by nature and  embed distributed sensing in support of   cognitive behaviour e.g. allowing local autonomy. modularity  in design and manufacturing will be   essential to permit cost efficient design, composition and  deployment of these instruments.  moreover, the design and use of such smart instruments  improves the dexterity and increases the   precision of the intervention. this is due to their  patient-specific design but also to the   possibility of using different diagnosis tools, since  instruments embed sensors or can be designed   with different materials.  the design of smart surgical instruments is also connected  with the 3d printing techniques, image   analysis and sensor fusion methods and distributed control  theories.  the selected candidate will be invited to submit a msca if  proposal together with prof. fiorini,   supervisor of the proposal. the involvement of the selected  candidate in the proposal writing   process will provide ample opportunity to tailor the  proposal to his / her research

258,2015,"two postdoc positions in visual/force  shared control architectures (romans eu h2020 project) at inria/irisa-cnrs,  rennes, france"," the lagadic group at inria/irisa rennes, france http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html has *two* funded postdoc positions (*postdoc1* and *postdoc2*, up to 3  years) in the context of the new eu h2020 project *romans* (robotic  manipulation for nuclear sort and segregation). the romans project involves 5 top institutions across europe (uk, france  and germany), and its goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in mixed  autonomy for automatically sorting, segregating and cleaning up nuclear  waste by exploiting robotics arms equipped with onboard sensors (e.g.,  cameras) and under the partial guidance of a human operator. in particular, the following meta-tasks will be addressed withing romans: 1) developing novel hardware and software solutions for advanced  bilateral master-slave teleoperation 2) developing advanced autonomy methods for highly adaptive automatic  grasping and manipulation actions 3) combining autonomy and teleoperation methods using state-of-the-art  understanding of mixed initiative planning, variable autonomy and shared  control approaches 4) delivering a final demonstrator in an industrial plant-representative  environment -- description of the activities -- the lagadic group will contribute to the romans project by addressing  the following topics with the two offered positions (*postdoc1* and  *postdoc2*): - *postdoc1*: development of robust visual servoing and visual tracking  techniques for precisely positioning a robot arm over an object to be  grasped (also articulated or deformable) in presence of several  constraints (e.g., limited field of view, forbidden/dangerous zones for  the robot manipulator) and/or limited knowledge of the object 3d model  (by both exploring model-based and model-free servoing solutions).  exploitation of sensory redundancy for minimizing the effects of  occlusions or difficult tracking of the objects of interest. the  possible presence of a second robotic arm acting as ""supporting eye""  will be considered for improving the robustness of the system to  real-world conditions. integration of the developed visual control  algorithms in a higher-level shared control architecture (coordinating  with postdoc2) - *postdoc2*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being  executed. the goal is to suitably apply and extend the classical  force-feedback bilateral teleoperation framework to the particular tasks  addressed in the project (visual/sensor-based shared control of a  robotic arm approaching objects of interest to be grasped). the postdoc will investigate different combinations of force cues  displayed to the human operator (possibly varying with the particular  phase: free-motion, approaching, in contact, grasping, etc.), by  considering the possible use of ""local planners"" for quickly exploring  the future consequences of the operator's commands against the system  constraints (e.g., limited camera fov, joint limits, occlusions,  forbidden regions), and by participating to the design and  implementation of user evaluation studies for assessing the  performance/effectiveness of the proposed shared control architecture. opportunities to actively collaborate with the several romans partners  will be highly encouraged. co-supervision of phd students involved in  the project is also possible -- candidates' expected profile -- -

303,2016,phd opening in cognitive robotics," =============================================================================== phd position in cognitive robotics, mascor institute, fh aachen, germany =============================================================================== university:	fh aachen university of applied sciences department:	electrical engineering and information technology location:	aachen, germany start date: 	1 january 2017 duration:	3 years closing date:	30 september 2016 =============================================================================== the mobile autonomous systems and cognitive robotics (mascor) institute at fh aachen university of applied sciences, aachen, germany, has an opening for a research position in the field of cognitive robotics. the post is remunerated following tariffs for german civil service employees level 13 (tvl-13). the possibility for attaining a phd is given. research topic -------------- the opening is within the project ""contrakt"" (constraint-based tranformations of abstract high-level plans into executable actions for mobile robots) funded by the german national science foundation (dfg). while  research in the field of autonomous mobile robots operating in human-populated environments has seen significant progress, when it comes to robustly executing high-level robot plans, problems remain. the reason is that the execution of seemingly simple actions such as driving to a specific location requires many interdependent system components working together in a complex way; this yields a plethora of potential error sources. while approaches exist that try to solve this coordination problem, there is no explicit separation between the task of the robot and the system requirements from a user point of view. the disadvantages are that the planning task becomes more complex and applications are specific to a particular platform. this in turn requires deep system understanding on the side of the user. in contrast, this project envisions to separate the high-level task from internal requirements of how to execute it on the robot. the idea is to transform a particular plan at runtime in such a way that the required system components together with their dependencies are automatically integrated based on a declarative language specification. at the same time, information needed for execution monitoring and possible error recovery will be provided. the results will be evaluated on different mobile robots in domestic environments. task description ---------------- the candidate is to develop high-level control programs for mobile robots in the action language readylog which is based on the well-known action language golog. furthermore, the candidate needs to develop a prolog-based constraint solver which interprets system-level contraints of the robot and compiles them into the high-level control strategy of the robot. finally, the candidate should formally design and formulate internal models of service robot systems and such systems' requirements with respect to the task domain. the approach will be implemented and tested on multiple robots, namely on the mobile service robot ""caesar"" which is located at the knowledge-based system group, rwth aachen university, and on festo robotino robots in logistic robots' applications. possibility to attain a phd --------------------------- the research will be carried out in cooperation with knowledge-based systems group (kbsg) at rwth aachen university under the supervision of prof. g. lakemeyer. within the project, the candidate has the possibility to attain a phd of rwth aachen university under the joint supervision of prof. lakemeyer (rwth aachen) and prof. ferrein (fh aachen). profile ------- the mascor institute is seeking a candidate with * a master's degree in computer science or similar qualification * very good knowledge in c++ and prolog * good knowledge and demonstrable experience in the field of ai and knowledge representation * good working knowledge and experience in developing applications for mobile robots * strong problem-solving and analytical skills * very good written and verbal communication skills * profound ability to summarize key findings how to apply ------------ please apply with the usual documents to the email address 05-771 at fh-aachen.de until september 30 or to personaldezernat der fh aachen, kennziffer 05-771, bayernallee 11, 52066 aachen. if you have any questions, please contact: prof. a. ferrein <ferrein at fh-aachen.de> --  prof. dr. alexander ferrein mobile autonomous systems & cognitive robotics institute robotics and foundations of computer science fh aachen - university of applied sciences department of electrical engineering and information technology eupener strasse 70 | 52066 aachen | germany t: +49 241 6009 51904   | f: +49 241 6009 52190 e: ferrein at fh-aachen.de | w: www.ferrein.fh-aachen.de"

311,2016,"two fully funded ph.d positions in  social robotics @ aass, orebro university,  sweden "," the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)  at ?rebro university has openings for 2 fully funded  phd  projects (4 years) in social robotics. the phds will specifically be on 1.) social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy and 2.) measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics. the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn). more information on each position and how to apply is provided below. the expected starting date for both phd positions is 1st of april. we want your applications no later than november 30, 2016. for formal inquiry contact: prof. amy loutfi (amy.loutfi at oru.se) research topics ---------------------------- topic 1: social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy mobile robotic telepresence is used as a social communication aid for older adults, with remote users steering the robot in its environment using feedback from a robot's sensors. for unfamiliar drivers, this often creates a heavy workload and therefore reduces focus on social interaction. one way to reduce the workload is to introduce autonomy to assist the remote user in operating the robot. sliding autonomy is a way to automatically adapt the level of autonomy depending on the current context.the researcher will study how sliding autonomy can be implemented in social robotic telepresence by taking into considerations non-verbal cues as well as social norms. the researcher will also study the effect of sliding autonomy on the workload for operating the robot, and on the associated interaction quality. the researcher will undertake two secondments: (1) an academic secondment to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, to work on interface design for teleoperated robots; (2) an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, germany, to study cost-effective solutions to support sliding autonomy. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2553&rmlang=uk topic 2: measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics initial studies on mobile robotic telepresence suggest that evaluation using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can lead to a greater understanding of the perceived safety and security. the research goal for this particular position is to test this hypothesis, and to extend the work to include autonomous robot systems operating at varying levels of autonomy, and with varying levels of social behavior. the end result will advance the soa regarding autonomous systems supporting independent living with respect to: (1) the systems? ability to increase the sense of safety and security, (2) the relation between interaction quality, level of autonomy and sense of safety and security, and (3) new quantitative measures that can support qualitative evaluation tools. during a secondment  to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, evaluation procedures will be compared and combined. during an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, alternative approaches to evaluation of social robots will be investigated and compared, possibly leading to modified procedures. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2554&rmlang=uk about ?rebro university and aass ----------------------------------------------- ?rebro university is seeking outstanding candidates for two phd positions in computer science at the center of applied autonomous  sensor systems. the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass), carries out multi-disciplinary research environment at ?rebro university in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer science. successful applicants will join the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.oru.se_aass&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=b66frycb1clpvv8uaass4d8a5cuxijz2xy1n8fnefow&e= ) at ?rebro university,  sweden . salaries for phd students at ?rebro university are internationally competitive. with over 40 senior researchers and phd students, aass is one of the largest robotics research groups in  sweden . the research and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic, and phd students come from many different countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds. about socrates ------------------------- the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn) comprising  7 universities/research institutes: ume?
