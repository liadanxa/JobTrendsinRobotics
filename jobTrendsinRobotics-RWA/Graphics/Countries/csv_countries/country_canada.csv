there is a fully-sponsored phd position at the department of mechanical
engineering at the university of canterbury, new zealand.

 

project description
microrobots with high positioning accuracy (at the scale of nanometers) and
biomems devices with small size (at the scale of micrometers to centimeters)
are widely used to manipulate micron-sized objects such as biological cells.
with their unparallel capabilities of manipulating cells, microrobotic
systems and biomems devices have been receiving increasingly remarkable
attention. recently, we have developed a fully automated zebrafish embryo
injection system, semi-automated adherent cell injection system, and a pdms
elastic device for cell mechanics characterization. more information can be
found at: http://individual.utoronto.ca/wangwenhui

 

field of study
the project will feature one or a combination of the following topics
according to the preference of the student: 

(1) high-throughput microrobotic parallel cell injection;
(2) microrobot-aided high-throughput cloning; 
(3) micro-fluidic devices for cell manipulation; 
(4) mems-based stem cells characterization. 

in (1) and (2), a microrobotic system based on high precision manipulators
is to be developed to manipulate/characterize biological
cells/beads/organisms with high-throughput for large-scale screening
scenarios. a successful candidate should have hands-on experience or strong
background in motion control and computer vision. 

in (3) and (4), biomems devices are to be designed and microfabricated with
the aim to manipulate/characterize biological cells. a successful candidate
should have hands-on experience or strong background in mechanical design,
integrated circuit design, or mems device design and fabrication. excellent
knowledge in sensing/actuating theories, design and simulation software (e.
g. solidworks, ansys) is a plus. 



requirement on qualifications
all candidates with high motivation, enthusiasm, and independent thinking
are welcome to apply. preference is given to students with a strong research
track record from any one of the fields: mechanical engineering, electrical
engineering, computer sciences, automation and control, mechatronics
engineering, or related disciplines. 



funding arrangements
the successful candidate will receive a full scholarship lasting 3 years,
and be expected to start as early as possible. all applications will be
considered immediately until the position is filled.

 

interested candidates please send cv to: wenhui.wang at canterbury.ac.nz.

caris lab and muxlab are seeking applications for two one-year (each
renewable for a second year) postdoctoral fellowships at the university of
british columbia in mechanical engineering and computer science in
vancouver, canada, *commencing may 1, 2011,* or as soon as possible
thereafter.

* *

*background: *this project exploits an emerging paradigm-shift for
manufacturing systems, which relies on taking robots “out of the cage” and
developing intelligent robotic assistants that can collaborate both directly
and physically with human co-workers in their tasks as part of the
production team. our advances will be driven by a primary understanding of
the support needs of workers in advanced manufacturing plants, and
implemented using new technologies and methods generated by both the
research team and our industrial partner, a major user and innovator of
large-scale manufacturing, assembly and automation.  our results will be
deployed, tested and evaluated on a unified platform for industry-identified
representative challenge tasks.



*project descriptions: *the two individuals will work on two coordinated
efforts: in topic 1 to assess, design and then integrate our new hri
techniques into the manufacturing process, and in topic 2 to innovate and
evaluate the novel low-level techniques themselves.



*topic 1: robot-assistant-in-manufacturing task design.  *the successful
candidate will be responsible for user studies and evaluations validating
the human-robot interaction in command/control, physical proximity of the
robotic assistant, and situational awareness needs and adequacy. working
closely and often in-situ with the industry partner, this includes (a)
interaction specifications from a systems view of the robotic assistant -
when is it useful, what is the context, and how does it affect the way
people work?  (b) evaluation methodology choice and execution throughout the
requirements, development and validation design cycle; and (c) research
questions such as “appropriate-modality” communication: how do we use
multiple modalities to effectively code a “message” in a given situation?

* *

*topic 2: communication loop design. *the successful candidate will be
responsible for the design, implementation and demonstration of the
communication loop between a robot and human, utilizing observed human cues
and robot feedback signals.  they will also supervise student working on
sub-projects related to cue recognition and transmission, robot
teach-by-showing, and robot control architecture for implicit communication
behaviour.



both individuals will take a leadership role, and assist in the supervision
of graduate and undergraduate students working on the project. the two
individuals will collaborate closely with one another, as well as with
certain offsite members of the larger team.

* *

*application criteria: *successful candidates will have completed ph.d.
research in computer science (hci, hri), mechanical/ mechatronics
engineering, electrical engineering, or a comparable discipline(s). both
need at least a general background in hci, experience in user study design
and execution, evidence of independent work, strong team skills, and
excellent communication abilities. in addition, he or she will have one and
ideally more of the following skills or background experience, demonstrated
by a corresponding publication record. the criteria will vary somewhat for
the two roles (controls experience is weighted more heavily for topic 2, and
deeper experience in hci including qualitative methods more important for
topic 1):

             - hands-on experience working with mechatronic/robotic systems


             - robotics and controls

             - familiarity with industrial manufacturing environments

             - task and workflow analysis methods

             - human attentional processing

             - iterative design and prototyping



*to apply: *please send the following information to
mux-postdoc-recruiting at cs.ubc.ca:

             - a brief letter of application, clarifying the projects
area(s) of interest and fit to the area(s)

150,2018,2 phd positions open on spatial  compliant mechanisms at tu delft," dear colleagues, it is my pleasure to alert you to two four-year fully funded phd positions available at delft university of technology. i am looking for students with a (computational) kinematics and compliant mechanisms background with affection to mechanism design synthesis methods and applications. in particular, the project is about spatially curved flexures for very-close-to-body gravity support systems for industry workers and people with muscular weakness. should you have talented and committed msc graduates in these or closely related fields i would be grateful if you could pass the description below on to them. naturally i will be pleased to provide more information to those who are interested. candidates can send a cv and motivation letter via email. thank you and best wishes, just outline the project builds on work in previous projects on what we call ""shell mechanisms"". these are spatially curved flexures that are designed to have predefined motion patterns (such as pure rotation about remote center of motion), predefined load-deflection behaviour (such as near-zero stiffness or bistability). some illustrative references are listed below, showing that several analysis and synthesis methods for spatially curved flexures were developed and that demonstrators were made for gravity balancing of simple motions and for predefined stiffness in certain directions. the present project is named ""shell skeletons"" and addresses new challenges, in particular coupled multi-dof motion, adjustability to varying payload, and manufacturability. the project is part of a larger program called ""wearable robotics"", funded by the dutch national science foundation nwo in their ""perspectief"" scheme. in this program six dutch technical and medical universities, over a dozen national and international companies, and several patient organization participate. a summary and list of participants can be found here<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.nwo.nl_en_news-2dand-2devents_news_2017_32-2dmillion-2deuros-2dfor-2dtop-2dlevel-2dtechnological-2dresearch.html-23robotica&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=0n2s6eiwin0nakdrsvflrm7-rp64j-iuta5c8qsz-wk&s=4jr1rmrny99cbqpi-hwxjjnkkuqc7num9tqd5x4o3z4&e=>. in total, 13 phd students and 2 postdocs will be appointed. consequently there will be a lot of collaboration with the different project partners as well as with other groups. phd students receive further guidance from the graduate school, and a research stay at another lab in the netherlands or abroad typically is also part of the project. more on doing a phd at delft can be found here<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.tudelft.nl_en_about-2dtu-2ddelft_working-2dat-2dtu-2ddelft_phds-2dat-2dtu-2ddelft_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=0n2s6eiwin0nakdrsvflrm7-rp64j-iuta5c8qsz-wk&s=4xmblgdh_tdhbxvbwvpv_qy1wpp-9adizi1ybgwt9jk&e=>. project summary: shell skeletons: spatially curved compliant mechanisms for complex spatial motion with adjustability to varying load the main aim of this project is to develop exo-aids that are truly shell-based, that is, they gain all of their motion as well as support force from the elastic deformation of spatially curved compliant shells that conform to the body's contours while generating the required non-linear force-deflection behavior even for complex (coupled) body motions. the present project will extend the state of the art in shell mechanisms in three key directions: shell skeletons that can (1) move in space, in particular taking the coupled motion into account between upper body and upper arm, and between elbow and shoulder joints; (2) be adjusted to varying loads; (3) be built from suitable material structures (including associated manufacturing methods) that enable a large range of motion while generating sufficient force to carry body parts. the project will generate theory, modeling, design methodology, and basic technology demonstrators, and is subdivided in two phd position. the results will be employed in companion projects for the development of exo-aid prototypes which in turn will generate feedback for the improvement of methods and designs in the shell skeleton project. while the above aspects will be present in both phd projects, the topics of the two phd projects at delft can be distinguished as follows: 1.      computational synthesis method for spatial shells accommodating coupled motion in serial chains with application to upper extremity exoskeletons 2.      spatially curved flexures with predefined load-deflection characterisitics: innovative design concepts and experimental mechanical evaluation illustrative references on shell mechanisms: leemans j, sande wwpj van de, kim c, herder jl (2018) unified stiffness characterization of non-linear compliant shell mechanisms (accepted jmr). nijssen j, radaelli g, herder jl, ring jb, kim c, spatial concept synthesis of compliant mechanisms utilizing non-linear eigentwist characterization, asme intl design engineering technical conferences, quebec city, canada, aug 26-29, idetc2018-85307. sande wwpj van de, herder jl, analysis of parasitic motion in compliant mechanisms using eigenwrenches and eigentwists, asme intl design engineering technical conferences, quebec city, canada, aug 26-29, idetc2018-86262. radaelli g, herder jl (2017) gravity balanced compliant shell mechanisms, international journal of solids and structures, (118-119)78-88 (doi: 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.04.021). nijssen jpa, radaelli g, ring jb, kim c, herder jl (2017) design and analysis of a shell mechanism based two-fold force controlled scoliosis brace, asme intl design engineering technical conferences, cleveland, oh, august 6-9, idetc2017-67812. radaelli g, herder jl (2017) a potential energy field (pef) approach to the design of a compliant self-guiding statically-balanced straight-line mechanism, mechanism and machine theory (114)141-155 (doi: 10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2017.04.007). radaelli g, herder jl (2016) a monolithic compliant large-range gravity balancer, mechanism and machine theory (102)55-67 (doi: 10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2016.03.015). examples of related work going on in the lab: delissen a, radaelli g, shaw la, hopkins jb, herder jl (2018) design of an isotropic metamaterial with constant stiffness and zero poisson's ratio over large deformations, journal of mechanical design (doi: 10.1115/1.4041170). nelson t, herder jl, developable compliant-aided rolling-contact mechanisms, mech. mach. theory (126)225-242 (doi: 10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2018.04.013) farhadi machekposhti d, herder jl, tolou n (2018) a compliant micro frequency quadrupler transmission utilizing singularity, j.mems 27(3)506-512 (doi: 10.1109/jmems.2018.2825442). rommers j, radaelli g, herder jl (2017) pseudo rigid body modeling of a single vertex compliant-facet origami mechanism, asme j. mech. rob. 9(3)031009 (doi: 10.1115/1.4035881). weeke s, tolou n, s?mon g, herder jl (2017) a monolithic force balanced oscillator, asme journal of mechanisms and robotics, 9(2)021004 (doi:10.1115/1.4035544). prof. dr. ir. just l. herder head of department, precision and microsystems engineering chair, mechatronic system design group delft university of technology mekelweg 2, 2628cd, delft, the netherlands www.pme.tudelft.nl"

201,2020,full-time international phd position at  university college dublin  ireland  ," phd  ireland  : develop a framework using machine learning (ml) to identify specific features of stress response using plant phenotyping background:early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant for food security but methodologically complex. plant stress responses can be observed using non-invasive methods such as plant imaging. the use of different camera sensors such as rgb, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence enable the detection of altered plant performance in response to environmental stress. such changes include slower growth, senescent changes in the spectral reflectance and modified fluorescence responses of leaves. although these changes cannot be captured by human eye, the imaging sensors used in this project can perceive such changes very fast. to understand the early responses of plants to environmental stress, we will develop a framework of data collection, storage and curation, trait extraction and utilization of ml and classification algorithms to extract the features from plant images. plant images will be collected using imaging platforms in a controlled environment and unmanned aerial vehicles in field conditions(uavs). project:this exciting project will develop a specific framework that utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization and visualisation to identify specific features of stress response using thousands of plant images. the ph.d. student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by assoc. prof. eleni mangina from ucd- school of computer science and assist. prof. dr. snia negro (ucd- school of

a critical role in defining offspring health, both in childhood and in later life. according to the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) hypothesis, transient environmental exposures during critical periods of development (such as the pre-conceptional, fetal and early infant phases of life) can alter the health trajectory of the offspring. maternal diet is a modifiable behaviour that could play an important role in maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. novel findings from our individual birth cohort studies and the alphabet consortium highlight the potential influence of maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential during pregnancy on birth outcomes and a range of offspring childhood health outcomes. however limited data regarding the interrelationships between maternal diet and lifestyle, placental development and birth and childhood outcomes in humans exist. project: this exciting project will address this gap in the knowledge base by harnessing information on maternal diet &amp; lifestyle and pregnancy/birth/offspring outcomes using existing databases and analysis of biological samples from several birth cohort studies. the phd student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by dr catherine phillips, assistant professor and lead principal investigator for this research programme at the school of public health, physiotherapy and sports science, university college dublin. details: this is a 4-year full-time position, open to eu and non-eu candidates, with a stipend of 18,000 per annum.  qualifications: candidates should hold a bachelor's degree in nutrition, biological sciences (physiology, developmental biology, reproduction), public health or related field and have an interest in early life/fetal programming, nutrition and metabolic health. experience in pregnancy and childhood research, epigenetics or nutritional assessment techniques would be desirable.  application process: informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to dr. catherine phillips (catherine.phillips at ucd.ie). applications including a detailed cv, letter of motivation (max 2 pages, single spaced), transcripts and two letters of recommendation (to be sent directly from referee) should be sent to catherine.phillips at ucd.ieno later than march 23rd 2020. 	phd opportunity: dietary sugars / sweeteners during pregnancy and their impact on long term maternal metabolic and reproductive health background: there is significant evidence that an unhealthy diet greatly increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and predisposes offspring to metabolic dysfunction and obesity. while fat intake is typically associated with the onset of obesity and its comorbidities, there is increasing evidence linking sugar, particularly high fructose corn syrup, to the global rise in obesity rates. furthermore the detrimental effects of fructose intake during pregnancy on mother and child have been clearly outlined. despite their wide availability there is only limited information regarding their impact on maternal pregnancy outcomes, placental/fetal development and long term risk of cardio-metabolic complications in the mother. previous work from the group has demonstrated that the artificial sweetener ace-k increases insulin resistance during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. this project will investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners in combination with a high fat diet during pregnancy on maternal obesity, metabolic and reproductive health during successive pregnancies. this project will provide training in key laboratory skills ranging from rodent physiology, biochemical, cellular and molecular techniques. training in experimental design, data analysis and scientific writing will also be provided. this project would be ideal for a student with a background in a biological science (nutrition, physiology, reproduction, biochemistry) with a keen interested in nutrition and metabolic health. funding information:this is a 4-year full-time position with a stipend of e18,000 per annum. how to apply: the application must be submitted via email to clare.reynolds at ucd.ie not later than tuesday, 10th march 2020 and must include to find out more: enquiries can be directed via email to the lead investigator, dr clare reynolds (clare.reynolds at ucd.ie). the research demonstratorships will be available for up to 4 years full time phd studies. they will be awarded competitively on

new collaborative science foundation ireland (sfi) strategic partnership research programme, entitled consus, focussed on the application of precision agriculture to crop production with a particular emphasis on optimisation of agri-food production systems leading to more efficient food production with lower environmental impacts. the outcomes from this research programme will deliver a step-change in crop agronomy tools and practices, leading to enhanced global competitiveness. applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a 4-year phd studentship with the consus team researching crop nutrition and limits to yield potential. globally, major gains in crop yield and quality have been made through the application of the major plant nutrients (macronutrients) such as n, p and k in fertilizer. however, with the supply of adequate levels of these macronutrients, concentrations of micronutrients, such as zn, cu and mn, in soil and plant can drop below optimum and become yield- and quality-limiting. this is particularly the case in more intensive cropping systems with higher yields and removal of micronutrients in exported plant materials. fertilizer n is a major variable input cost to most conventional farming systems. in addition, poor use efficiency can increase the risk of loss to the wider environment, and associated impacts on water quality, air quality, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. this phd will use laboratory and field experimental approaches to develop an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat. this position will be in the ucd school of agriculture and food science

commonly associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs. in humans, most hev infections cause an acute, self-limiting hepatitis. however, severe disease can occur, particularly in pregnant women or those with pre-existing liver disease. hev infection is also associated with other disease manifestations including neurological disease, however the reason why severe disease occurs is poorly understood. currently, there are no specific treatments for hev, and there is no licenced vaccine in europe. hev is extremely challenging to propagate in cell culture, and there is no robust method to screen food products for the presence of infectious virus. this project will aim to develop in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hev, and to use these systems to investigate the biology of this virus in pigs and humans. the student will work with an interdisciplinary team at ucd, based at the veterinary sciences centre, and will have the opportunity to develop their research skills in one health and zoonotic disease. the student will collaborate with research groups at ucd, the university of birmingham and pirbright institute in the uk, and the cleveland clinic,

post doc position, please write to prof. rafael sacks, atcvsacks at technion.ac.il the design and use of technology has serious implications for society as a whole. there is increasing public concern about issues such as anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of military and surveillance technologies, and the possible impacts of automation and artificial intelligence. however, decisions about technological systems are often made without transparency or democratic oversight. engineers bear much of the responsibility for the development, construction, and maintenance of technological systems, but in whose interests do they act? engineering institutions claim to be committed to public welfare, but can engineers really balance that commitment with meeting the demands of employers and clients? there is in fact evidence to suggest that the culture of engineering education and professional practice discourages engineers from placing sufficient importance on public welfare. further research is needed in this area; this phd will address that need by exploring the relationship between engineering, professional responsibility, and public welfare. both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be used to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of engineering students and professionals in ireland, as well as the contexts in which these engineers study and work. applications for this phd scholarship are invited from candidates from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography,

the advantages of the technology is its ability to tailor the design, to meet specific patient needs. given the individualized part printing however, a key consideration is to ensure the quality of the printed device. this phd project will involve the printing of both polymeric and fibre reinforced polymer composites, for use in prosthetic devices. the printing will be carried out using both a laboratory and a pilot scale fused filament fabrication system. the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the printed parts will be extensively investigated and correlated with the processing conditions. a number of advanced process diagnostic techniques (including optical imagining), will be used to monitor the printing process. working closely with colleagues in computer science, the data collected will be analysed, in order to provide process feedback. the objective is to determine if the in-process measurements can be correlated with print defects (i.e. porosity), and where possible can help to predict the formation of defects before they occur. funding: scholarship support for this phd is through the science foundationi-form advanced manufacturing research
