computing and information science program
masdar institute of science and technology

the mii-ai lab in the computing and information science program at the  
masdar institute of science and technology is looking for a postdoc  
with expertise at the intersection of artificial intelligence and  
human-robot interaction.  the masdar institute of science and  
technology is a new us-style, graduate research institution being  
established in abu dhabi, uae in partnership with mit.  the institute  
is graduating its first class of msc students this summer, and will  
begin a phd program in the fall.  the institute’s goal is to become a  
world-class research institute at the graduate level focused on  
advanced energy and sustainable technologies.  for more information  
about masdar institute, please see www.masdar.ac.ae.

in this project, we are concerned with developing ai and human-robot  
interaction technologies that allow a user to effectively interact  
with a remote humanoid robot to perform a challenging task in a  
dynamic and complex environment.  we are particularly interested in  
developing capabilities that allow everyday end-users to imbue robots  
with intelligent, highly customized, skills that the user can utilize  
in real-time operations.  application areas include exploration of  
hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor, maintenance of deep-water oil  
wells, power plant maintenance, space exploration, search and rescue,  
and other remote sensing activities.

applicants with experience or demonstrated ability in some or all of  
the following research areas will have an advantage: machine learning,  
learning from demonstrations, human-robot interaction, human-robot  
interfaces, computer vision/image processing, data fusion/sensor  
fusion, probabilistic models, supervisory control, and other areas of  
artificial intelligence.  strong programming skills are also important.

the successful applicant should demonstrate the capability and desire  
to develop their own research project (within the topic) that meets  
their own strengths and interests.  applicants should send a cv and a  
1-2 page research statement to jacob crandall (jcrandall at masdar.ac.ae  
or jcrandal at mit.edu).  the research statement should describe the  
applicant’s background and interests as they relate to this research  
project.

compensation for postdoctoral associates at masdar institute is very  
competitive, with salaries typically upwards of $68,000 (usd) per  
year, plus full health insurance benefits.
