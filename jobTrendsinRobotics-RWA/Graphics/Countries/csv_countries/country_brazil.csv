5,2015,post-doctoral position on robust 	filtering implemented in fpga," -- [apologies for multiple postings] the intelligent systems laboratory (lasi) in electrical and computer engineering department at university of sao paulo, sao carlos campus, brazil has currently available 1 (one) post-doctoral research position. we seek researchers with knowledge on robust control and fpga to integrate the research team for the project ""fault tolerant attitude and heading reference system based on robust markovian kalman filter implemented in fpga"". the successful candidates are expected to have background and experience in one (or more) of the following areas: * robust control and filtering; * autonomous vehicles; * fpga. this proposal aims to develop a fault tolerant attitude, orientation and position reference system based on a robust markovian kalman filter (rmkf). this rmkf performs better than the standard markovian kalman filter to the data fusion from low cost inertial measurement units (imus). the main contribution of this postdoctoral research is the development of an rmkf array algorithm for the implementation of the fixed point proposed system in an fpga (field programmable gate array) to deal with a set of imus. this project will be implemented in partnership with the intelligent systems laboratory (lasi), with the mobile robotics laboratory (lrm) both of the university of s?o paulo at s?o carlos. these laboratories develop research in the areas of robotics, robust control and filtering, and estimation of attitude and position of autonomous vehicles. the results of this proposal will be applied on an autonomous truck. the grant has a duration of 24 months, and it is expected to start on march 2015. applications should be sent to marco h. terra (terra at sc.usp.br) by replying to this email and should include * a detailed cv, including a list of publications, * a brief statement about research interests and motivation to join the project, and * the name and contact of 2 references. applications will be considered between january 27 to february 10, 2015. _______________________________ marco henrique terra university of s?o paulo at s?o carlos"
6,2015,phd position in quantifying insect  vision for biorobotic inspiration," i would like to announce the opening of the following phd position in the baird/dacke lab in the lund vision group at lund university in  sweden . the position will be available in early 2016. for more detailed information and expressions of interest please contact emily baird (emily.baird at biol.lu.se). project description: flying bees are able to use visual information to control flight and navigate in visually distinct environments, ranging from dark cluttered rainforests in the tropics to the open tundra of the arctic circle. does the efficiency with which different bees perform visually guided tasks in their diverse native habitats depend on specialized flight control systems, or do many use similar, inherently robust, schema? recent work in our lab has shown that variations do exist in the eye morphology within single bee genera where species are native to different habitats. this suggests that specialisations do occur - at least in the sensory structures that extract visual information from the environment. yet, environment specific specialisations are poorly characterised and it is unknown how they lead to functional differences in behaviour between species. the aim of this project is to investigate how evolution has shaped the visual flight control systems of bees, enabling them to safely guide their flight through the diverse range of environments that they inhabit. the project will involve quantifying the anatomy and flight behaviour of different species and using this information to generate mathematical models and simulations of guidance systems that will then be implemented on small flying robotic platforms to both test the validity of the biological principles that we discover and to develop useful, lightweight and efficient systems that can be used to safely guide autonomous robots through different natural environments. the anatomical focus of the project will be to use information from advanced micro computed tomography techniques, performed at synchrotron light sources, to construct functional optical and anatomical models of the eyes (left) and peripheral brain structures of several bee species. simulations based on those models will allow us to understand what information bees perceive in different visual environments and to relate each specialisation to the visual cues available in the habitat it evolved in. behavioural experiments will be performed at our field-sites in brazil, . and  sweden , and in our state-of-the-art laboratory setup in  sweden . the focus of behavioural experiments will aim to elucidate how any identified anatomical specialisations influence specific species ability for flight control and navigation. the results of this study will provide fundamental insights into task and environment specific visual processing strategies used by small insects in flight. through our close collaboration with the laboratory of intelligent systems at the swiss federal institute of technology, we aim to develop the principles that we learn from this study into guidance strategies that can be implemented on small flying robots. qualifications: the applicant should have demonstrated experience with computational and quantitative analysis of experimental or simulated data sets. a background in engineering or computer science is preferred but candidates with other backgrounds will be considered if technical competence can be demonstrated. previous experience in programming and image analysis using matlab (or another programming language) is highly desirable."
