expression of interest (2)  to: robotics-worldwide at usc.edu, euron-dist at iais.fraunhofer.de  date: monday, june 29, 2015, 1:08 pm    msca-if expression of interest: smart  instruments design for surgical robotic applications    description of the institution    the department of computer science of the university of  verona is looking for a highly motivated   candidate to apply for a marie sklodowska-curie individual  fellowship in the altair robotics   laboratory. the department of computer science of the  university of verona (italy) was funded in   2001 and is located in the south of verona. its main  research labs and offices are located in the   area of the medical-scientific centre of the university. the  department has several research and   teaching activities that represent a continuous of  competences from mathematics, through computer   science and computer engineering, up to physics. active  research areas are: discrete and application   mathematics, theory of computation, machine intelligence,  information systems, software engineering   and security, applied computing, cyber-physical systems,  applied and experimental condensed matter   physics. finally, the leadership of the department in  applied research and the impact on the   surrounding area are confirmed by research funding via  european, national and regional programs and   by the seven spin-offs created in the last years.  the altair robotics laboratory was founded in 2000,  concurrently with the establishment of the   courses automatic controls and robotics within the  department of computer science of the university   of verona. the main fields of exploration in the research  group range from surgical and medical   robotics, smart robotic instruments, images analysis,  virtual and augmented reality to mobile   robotics and uavs.    description of the position    the robotic group of the department of computer science  looks for an experienced researcher   (post-doc) with competences in robotics, control systems,  software development and bioinformatics,   to develop and extend projects in the field of smart  instrument design for surgical robots. the   robotics group aims at reinforcing their knowledge in this  field, by this opportunity. the post-doc   will find an environment of researchers at all levels with  whom he/she can collaborate to implement   the project.  reusability and modularity are key factors in design and  manufacturing of the next generation of   surgical instruments: smart surgical instruments.  instruments that are engineered based on   patient-specific pre-operative data designed to follow  specific access routes that cause minimal or   zero trauma, that are inherently compliant by nature and  embed distributed sensing in support of   cognitive behaviour e.g. allowing local autonomy. modularity  in design and manufacturing will be   essential to permit cost efficient design, composition and  deployment of these instruments.  moreover, the design and use of such smart instruments  improves the dexterity and increases the   precision of the intervention. this is due to their  patient-specific design but also to the   possibility of using different diagnosis tools, since  instruments embed sensors or can be designed   with different materials.  the design of smart surgical instruments is also connected  with the 3d printing techniques, image   analysis and sensor fusion methods and distributed control  theories.  the selected candidate will be invited to submit a msca if  proposal together with prof. fiorini,   supervisor of the proposal. the involvement of the selected  candidate in the proposal writing   process will provide ample opportunity to tailor the  proposal to his / her research interests. a   successful application will result in a one-year, or a  two-year appointment.    number of positions: 1    research field: robotics, automation and computer science  engineering  career stage: experienced researcher or 4-10 yrs (post-doc)  research profiles: recognised researcher (r2)    benefits    the salary is paid monthly, the post doc will have a desk on  a four-people office and he/she will   access to the university facilities. the university also  gives support for mobility period,   assistance for application procedure to obtain entry visa,  information about social security   protection and rules, procedure to have health insurance in  our country, support to find an   accommodation in verona and information on how to access to  the university nursery for researchers   with children.    contacts    https://metropolis.scienze.univr.it/altair/  requirements  an expression of interest shall be sent to prof. paolo  fiorini (paolo.fiorini at univr.it)  and
