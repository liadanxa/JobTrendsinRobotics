1,2006,postdoc position on mams modeling and control,"postdoc position in eu project protem

within the eu protem project, partners from academia and industry of
various eu countries (france, germany, switzerland, uk, netherlands) are
working on a next generation storage system for archiving and backup.
the aim is to realize a 1 petabyte memory in a box as small as a dvd
drive. the technology used will be probe storage, based on the ibm probe
storage program (millipede). in this technology, an array of thousands
of 100 um sized read/write heads is reading and writing data. in the
current architecture, the storage area is limited to the size of the
array, which is restricted to about 1 cm2. within the protem project,
the storage area will be expanded to several hunderd cm2, but the array
will still be small. therefore the array has to be positioned over this
big area with high accuracy and speed.

to study, design and realize this architecture, experts from very
different fields (media, mems, system architecture) will cooperate
closely in this 4 year, 10 meu project. one of the tasks of the
university of twente in the project will be to design and realize the
positioning system. we therefore have a vacancy for a postdoctoral
researcher in the field of (micro-)mechanical modelling for the duration
of 18 months. 

your task will be to evaluate various concepts of positioning systems on
their disadvantages and merits, and determine whether the overall
specifications of the device can be reached and using what concepts. for
this, a solid background in modelling and control engineering or mems is
required. we are looking for a person with strong communication skills,
capable of operating in a large, multi-national team.

for more information, please contact
prof. dr. ir. stefano stramigioli (s.stramigioli at utwente.nl
<mailto:s.stramigioli at ewi.utwente.nl> ) (control engineering) or dr. ir.

 "
6,2008,new chair in eindhoven on mechatronics and robotics,"new position full professor in precision mechatronics & robotics at the
tu eindhoven

established at the foundation of the university in 1956, the department
of mechanical engineering of the eindhoven university of technology
(tu/e) is now a premier research department and currently has
approximately 1000 engineering (bsc and msc) students and 100   phd
students. the department participates in the dutch 3tu centre of
excellence on intelligent mechatronic systems. within this centre a new
position has been established for a full professor in precision
mechatronics & robotics.

the region that surrounds eindhoven is characterised by a concentration
of high-tech industry. a focal point of the chair will therefore be on
new generations of high-tech systems. a profound knowledge and an
advanced use of precision mechatronics form a crucial part of the
further development of such systems. a major part of the research within
the new chair will therefore be on the design of precision mechatronic
systems with extreme performance requirements, using innovative
actuating, sensing and control principles, in order to achieve high
speed and high accuracy (up to the nanometer range). indeed,
requirements on precision, accuracy, stability, reliability and speed
are ever more challenging issues in the design and realisation of such
systems. a closely related research field is robotics, with a particular
focus on what is currently referred to as cybernics, as it is believed
that this kind of automation will form the cornerstone of the next
generation of robotics. an additional focus of the chair on the design
of robots in connection to its human-dominated environment will
therefore be welcome. candidates for the chair in precision mechatronics
and robotics should have an excellent research profile in at least one
of the fields described above. 

together with colleagues in control systems technology (steinbuch),
dynamics and control (nijmeijer), and systems engineering (rooda) the
newly appointed professor will be responsible for courses and student
projects in mechatronics, robotics, control, systems, and design, with
emphasis on micro-systems. courses for phd students will be given within
the framework of the graduate school dutch institute for systems and
control (disc).

requirements applicants should: 

* have a phd in engineering sciences, in applied physics or applied
mathematics, and several years of experience thereafter;

* be an authority in the development and application of modern methods
in mechatronics, in particular in fields like precision mechatronics,
and/or robotics, as evident from papers in reputed scientific journals,
invited lectures, membership of editorial boards, scientific committees,
filed patents, etc;

* have a proven record in the acquisition and the management of research
grants at a national and an international level;

* have ample experience in teaching courses at different levels and
proven didactic skills.

phd position on robots in the metaverse


project description
======================================
the metaverse (global standards among real and virtual worlds) project will
provide a standardized global framework that enables the interoperability
between virtual worlds (as for example second life, world of warcraft, imvu,
google earth and many others) and the real world (robots, sensors,
actuators, vision and rendering, social and welfare systems, banking,
insurance, travel, real estate and many others). the project is a funded
through the european itea organization and the dutch senternovem
organization. 

the metaverse project will start with a state-of-the-art review of existing
technology. the first step to classify robots is to create a taxonomy and
nomenclature that may be inspired by the linnaean classification system. the
robot taxonomy will define the criteria on which the classes and orders may
be distinguished. some first works on robot taxonomies are available (fong,
nourbakhsh, & dautenhahn, 2003; yanco & drury, 2004) and will be examined
for applicability. the robot taxonomy will then be applied to robots,
starting with currently available robots and then extending to historical
important robots. their data will be gathered in a web-based database, the
internet robot database (irdb). the irdb will be setup as a community
process that will enable the interested audience to continuously expand and
improve the database. based on the irdb and the taxonomy, a communication
standard and protocol will be developed in close collaboration with the
other metaverse partners, including philips research, vrije universiteit
amsterdam and utrecht university. last, several usage scenarios for the
communication standard and protocol will be developed and tested.

the department of industrial design (id) of the eindhoven university of
technology (tu/e), is a rapidly growing department. the department consists
of 500 students at the bachelor, master and phd level in addition to around
100 faculty members. id focuses on intelligent products, services and
networks. these innovative products enable people to interact with the
environment in an optimal and flexible way. this project will be embedded
into the designed intelligent group (di), which is a multidisciplinary and
highly international group addressing the design of the intelligence in
adaptive systems, products and related services. the cooperating disciplines
include computer science, electrical engineering, neural computing, software
engineering, psychology and industrial design.

requirements
======================================
the candidate should have a masters degree in computer science, information
science or a close related field. he/she should be seriously interested in
robotics, taxonomies, web technologies and communication protocols, as
witnessed by project results or relevant courses. the candidate must be able
to co-operate in a multidisciplinary and international team. the candidate
needs to have a scientific attitude and the motivation to perform his/her
research at the high level of technological design within the given time
frame.

appointment and salary
======================================
the appointment is for four years. as an employee of the university you will
receive a competitive salary as well as excellent employment conditions
(including excellent sport facilities and child care). the research in this
project must be concluded with writing a phd thesis. a salary is offered
starting at eur 2000,- per month (gross) in the first year and increasing up
to eur 2558,- per month (gross) in the last year. moreover 8% bonus share
(holiday supplement) is provided annually. assistance for finding
accommodation can be given.

    phd researcher games and virtual worlds (1,0 fte)


job description

the research project 'algorithms for manipulation planning
with imperfect parts and inaccurate manipulators' is funded
by the netherlands organisation for scientific research (nwo).

industrial automation systems must rely on simple manipulators
and modest sensing capabilities to be reliable and inexpensive.
research of the past decade shows that systems based on such
components are amenable to systematic analysis and design.

a major obstacle to practical application is that existing
results assume perfectly-shaped parts and manipulators that
operate with infinite precision, while real parts are
manufactured to tolerances and real manipulators are subject
to errors. the goal of this project is to tackle this severe
idealization and design algorithms for planning manipulation
tasks that are guaranteed to work despite part imperfection
and manipulator inaccuracy. taking into account these variations
asks for completely different approaches to planning and design,
employing techniques and insights from the confluence of
computational geometry, robotics, and physical modelling.

the phd student will work in the area of algorithmic automation,
and will be supervised by dr. frank van der stappen.


qualifications

* master in computer science or in mathematics with a minor in cs.
* interest (and preferably background) in algorithms design.
* interest in applications in robotics and automation.
* fluency in english writing.

the informatics institute at the university of amsterdam is looking for a

                full professor in machine learning

the position focuses on machine learning, with a special emphasis on its 
application to autonomous systems interacting with humans. using 
distributed sensors, such systems observe their environment, including 
the people contained in it, and generate goal-direct autonomous 
behavior. machine learning is a critical tool, not only for processing 
observations and understanding the environment, but for selecting the 
most effective behaviors.since autonomous systems and the machine 
learning tools that make them possible are of growing importance in many 
branches of computer science, they are strategic priorities at the 
university of amsterdam. examples of applications abound in gaming, 
safety and crisis management, health care, information retrieval, 
transport management, robotics and image processing. over the past 
decades, the informatics institute (ivi) at the university of amsterdam 
has established an internationally recognized research group in this 
area. combining foundational, experimental and applied work, the group 
is active at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer 
interaction, robotics and computer vision. it aims to develop the 
algorithms necessary for building real-world autonomous systems.
doing so will require new advances in topics such as adaptive sensing, 
supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and multiagent systems.
the new professor will lead this effort as chair of the above-mentioned 
group, one of the eight research groups that comprise the informatics 
institute. the appointee is expected to be a prominent scientist whose 
presence will strengthen the institute.

two research institutes, the informatics institute and the institute for 
logic, language and computation. the informatics institute encompasses 
around 230 members, organized in an education group, an administrative 
bureau and eight research groups that cooperate intensively, both 
formally and informally.

the faculty of science occupies a leading position internationally in 
its fields of research and participates in a large number of cooperative 
programs with universities, research institutes and businesses. the 
faculty has a student body of around 3,000 and 1,500 members of staff, 
spread over eight research institutes and a number of faculty-wide 
support services. a considerable part of the research is made possible 
by external funding from dutch and international organizations and the 
private sector. the faculty of science offers thirteen bachelor's degree 
programmes and eighteen master’s degree programs in the fields of the 
exact sciences, computer science and information studies, and life and 
earth sciences.

since september 2010, the whole faculty has been housed in a brand new 
building at the science park in amsterdam. the installment of the 
faculty has made the science park one of the largest centers of academic 
research in the netherlands.

we offer a challenging job at a dynamic and ambitious university, a 
permanent tenured appointment as full-time professor with a competitive 
salary and an attractive package of fringe benefits, for instance: 
generous leave arrangements, application for attractive fiscal 
arrangements are possible for employees from abroad, attractive 
retirement benefits, collective health insurance and excellent parental 
leave packages

application website: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten  

application deadline: september 21, 2012 (12 noon, italian time)

application requirements:

strongly-motivated candidates holding a master degree in computer science / engineering / mathematics or other related fields are invited to apply. applicants should ideally have a background in machine learning, robotics or human-robot interaction, with strong mathematical and computer programming skills (matlab, c++ or equivalent).

application procedure:

to apply please send a detailed cv, statement of motivation, bsc and msc transcripts, degree certificates and other support material such as reference letters to dr sylvain calinon (sylvain.calinon at iit.it). the applicants also need to fill the online application procedure from the university of genova: http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten .


the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a three year phd student position in
computer science at örebro university,  sweden .  the research area is
artificial intelligence and robotics, with special emphasis on
planning human-aware robot behavior.  the work will be performed in
the context of the eu project monarch.  application deadline: january
15, 2013.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the student will be to perform world-class research
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
specifically on the topic of planning human-aware robot behavior.  the
student will create, implement and test new techniques to allow a
robot, or team of robots, to generate plans to perform given tasks
that involve the interaction with humans.  what is new compared to
traditional planning is that these plans must ensure that the robot's
behavior complies with a set of social norms and social roles, which
may depend on the interaction context.

the research will be motivated by, guided by, and validated in a
specific application scenario: robots that interact with children in a
hospital, in order to entertain them or to participate in educational
activities.  depending on the context, robots may play different roles
and they may engage in different social relations with the children,
following different social norms.  for instance, robots may be
watchful guardians in some situations, or companion players in others.
the human-aware planning techniques developed in this research project
will take the social context, norms and roles into account, and
regulate the robots' behavior accordingly.

the successful candidate will be employed as phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  he or she will
work within the local monarch team at örebro university, but will also
collaborate with the other european partners in the monarch project,
both remotely and through physical meetings and research visits.  a
limited amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's
duties.

about the monarch project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

monarch (multi-robot cognitive systems operating in hospitals) is a
european union fp7 project.  the overall aims of monarch are (i) the
development of a novel framework to model mixed human-robot societies,
and (ii) its demonstration using a network of heterogeneous robots and
sensors, in the pediatric area of an oncological hospital.  it will
handle uncertainties introduced by people and robots, generate natural
interactions, and engage in edutainment activities.  the framework
developed in monarch will map concepts in social sciences into social
skills, group behaviors, and human-robot interaction, using learning
methodologies and decision-theoretic principles.

the expected outcomes of monarch are (i) an operational system able to
interact with people in a natural way, (ii) novel results on key
properties of networked robot systems, and (iii) guidelines to
translate the system to applications in hospital environments, and
further scenarios sharing similarities with them, e.g., kindergarten,
and personal assistance to elderly at home.

the monarch consortium is formed by nine top-level european
institutions and companies: the instituto superior técnico ( portugal ),
örebro university ( sweden ), universidad carlos iii ( spain ), instituto
português de oncologia de lisboa ( portugal ), ydreams robotics

the organization

farm technology group
the farm technology group is part of wageningen university and embedded in the plant sciences group of wageningen ur. the farm technology group aims at enhancing, exploiting and disseminating technology in primary agricultural production processes with the aim to fulfil the needs of mankind and nature in a sustainable way. this mission is achieved by combining knowledge, methodology and tools from technical sciences with biological, environmental, agricultural and social sciences in order to study, understand, manage and design biosystems. the group covers arable farming, (greenhouse) horticulture and livestock farming and variations and mixtures of these application domains as they emerge in response to challenges posed by moving towards a more bio-based economy. typical research instruments and expertise in our field include sensor technology, data analysis, systems analysis, continuous time and discrete time modelling, systems engineering, integral systems design, systems optimization and management and control of production processes, robotics and precision agriculture techniques.

the world is facing interesting challenges in the years to come: a growing population that needs to be fed, less people interested in working in agriculture, limited natural resources (e.g. fertilizers) and a growing concern about the environment (e.g. chemical crop protection). robots and (semi-)autonomous systems are an option for addressing these challenges, by supporting and replacing human labour and performing operations in a more directed and precise way (precision agriculture). the past 15 years, wageningen ur / the farm technology group has built up an extensive and unique portfolio in agro-robotics ranging from autonomous harvesting machines for horticulture to precision weed control in arable farming. as sensing (e.g. computer vision) is a well-established field of expertise within wageningen ur, we now wish to expand our agro-robotics work in the direction of 'intelligence' and high-level control.

23,2013,ph.d. position in ethics of robotics (with a focus on robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders),"the department of philosophy of the university of twente in the netherlands
is looking for a ph.d. student in ethics of robotics, with a focus on
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

your profile

a master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy (preferably but not
exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues

phd position on automatic analysis of affective and social behaviors in
human-robot interaction

http://www.utwente.nl/vacatures/en/

job specification
the human media interaction group at the university of
twente is looking for a phd candidate who will automatically analyse
social interactions based on the speakers' non-verbal behaviors in
speech (paralinguistic information). the aims are to automatically
determine the quality of social interaction between the speakers (both
in dialogues and multi-party conversations) and the speakers' affective
states using vocal cues. qualitative aspects of social interaction
include, amongst others, levels of engagement, cooperation,
enjoyableness, arousal, valence and rapport.

the work will be carried out within the contexts of two european
projects involving robots, namely teresa and squirrel. in the teresa
project, a telepresence robot is controlled by a human controller who
can have robot-mediated conversations with other humans in the vicinity
of the robot. in order to know whether a specific speaker attitude is
caused by the robot's or the human controller's behavior, an assessment
of the interaction is needed. the challenges are to give a continuous
assessment of the quality of interaction under natural conditions, and
to find out what non-verbal vocal cues can be used to detect qualitative
aspects of social interaction. in the squirrel project, children will be
interacting with a robot that aims to encourage and help them tidy up
and put objects back in order. in order to design effective robot
behaviors that encourage and help children tidy up, an assessment of the
interaction among the children and the robot is needed: is the
interaction fun, are the children engaged in the task, is one of the
children excluded in the interaction?

the work will cover a range of various tasks:

* the candidate will collect speech data by recording social
interactions between adult humans (french) and among children (german)
and robots. (s)he will develop and manage audio(visual) databases of
these recorded interactions.

* the candidate will perform analyses on the non-verbal vocal behavior
of the recorded interactions. the candidate will investigate what types
of qualitative and affective aspects of social interaction are relevant
in this context and annotations will be made.

* (s)he will identify relevant non-verbal vocal cues that correlate with
qualitative and affective aspects of social interaction.

* based on these annotations, the candidate will develop algorithms to
automatically assess qualitative and affective aspects of social
interaction, both in human adult and children speech.

* the candidate is expected to present his/her work in major
(international) conferences and workshops, and to publish in relevant
journals.


your profile

* the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
spoken language. since the candidate will be working with dutch, french
and german data, knowledge of these languages is preferable.

* the candidate has an msc degree in computer science or equivalent (a
degree with a technical background in, e.g., artificial intelligence,
computational linguistics).

* the candidate is interested in the research fields of speech analysis,
affective computing, social signal processing, and machine learning.

* the candidate has programming skills in one of the following languages
(or equivalents): python, perl, or matlab.

please send your application with your cv and motivation letter through
the application link before february 7, 2014. please also include the
names, email addresses, phone numbers, and information about past
working relationships of two people that we could contact for a
recommendation.

further information about the phd position can be given by dr. khiet
truong (k.p.truong at utwente.nl) and prof. dr. vanessa evers (email:
v.evers at utwente.nl).

88,2018,2 phd positions open on spatial  compliant mechanisms at tu delft," dear colleagues, it is my pleasure to alert you to two four-year fully funded phd positions available at delft university of technology. i am looking for students with a (computational) kinematics and compliant mechanisms background with affection to mechanism design synthesis methods and applications. in particular, the project is about spatially curved flexures for very-close-to-body gravity support systems for industry workers and people with muscular weakness. should you have talented and committed msc graduates in these or closely related fields i would be grateful if you could pass the description below on to them. naturally i will be pleased to provide more information to those who are interested. candidates can send a cv and motivation letter via email. thank you and best wishes, just outline the project builds on work in previous projects on what we call ""shell mechanisms"". these are spatially curved flexures that are designed to have predefined motion patterns (such as pure rotation about remote center of motion), predefined load-deflection behaviour (such as near-zero stiffness or bistability). some illustrative references are listed below, showing that several analysis and synthesis methods for spatially curved flexures were developed and that demonstrators were made for gravity balancing of simple motions and for predefined stiffness in certain directions. the present project is named ""shell skeletons"" and addresses new challenges, in particular coupled multi-dof motion, adjustability to varying payload, and manufacturability. the project is part of a larger program called ""wearable robotics"", funded by the dutch national science foundation nwo in their ""perspectief"" scheme. in this program six dutch technical and medical universities, over a dozen national and international companies, and several patient organization participate. a summary and list of participants can be found here<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.nwo.nl_en_news-2dand-2devents_news_2017_32-2dmillion-2deuros-2dfor-2dtop-2dlevel-2dtechnological-2dresearch.html-23robotica&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=0n2s6eiwin0nakdrsvflrm7-rp64j-iuta5c8qsz-wk&s=4jr1rmrny99cbqpi-hwxjjnkkuqc7num9tqd5x4o3z4&e=>. in total, 13 phd students and 2 postdocs will be appointed. consequently there will be a lot of collaboration with the different project partners as well as with other groups. phd students receive further guidance from the graduate school, and a research stay at another lab in the netherlands or abroad typically is also part of the project. more on doing a phd at delft can be found here<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.tudelft.nl_en_about-2dtu-2ddelft_working-2dat-2dtu-2ddelft_phds-2dat-2dtu-2ddelft_&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=0n2s6eiwin0nakdrsvflrm7-rp64j-iuta5c8qsz-wk&s=4xmblgdh_tdhbxvbwvpv_qy1wpp-9adizi1ybgwt9jk&e=>. project summary: shell skeletons: spatially curved compliant mechanisms for complex spatial motion with adjustability to varying load the main aim of this project is to develop exo-aids that are truly shell-based, that is, they gain all of their motion as well as support force from the elastic deformation of spatially curved compliant shells that conform to the body's contours while generating the required non-linear force-deflection behavior even for complex (coupled) body motions. the present project will extend the state of the art in shell mechanisms in three key directions: shell skeletons that can (1) move in space, in particular taking the coupled motion into account between upper body and upper arm, and between elbow and shoulder joints;

92,2018,"2 phd positions ml in agro-food  robotics tu delft, netherlands"," the cognitive robotics department at delft university of technology, the netherlands, announces two phd vacancies (fully funded, 4 years) in the area of agro-food robotics. *topic 1: force-interaction and bi-manual control* force interactions with soft and deformable natural objects are hard to predict and to control. next to a tight closed loop with visual and tactile perception, the robot controller needs a model of how the object is going to react in order to achieve fast and accurate interaction. the model needs to be adapted online, based on the interactions. we consider bi-manual manipulation, where the coupling between the two manipulators through the objects will require making the holding/fixating arm part of the model as well. rather than manually designing the manipulation strategies, we will employ reinforcement learning (learning from experience) to optimize the controllers. *topic 2: imitation learning and inverse control* the goal is to instruct robots by example how the task should be performed. we will rely on human demonstrations using skeleton tracking or motion capture rather than on kinesthetic demonstrations. the trajectories of the end-effector(s), as well as associated force and compliance parameters will be learned for individual sub-tasks. direct mapping from human demonstrations to a robot is not always efficient due to different embodiments, hence we rather want to extract the priors and the general strategies for tasks as well as the objective functions. instead of directly guiding the behavior of the robot, we can update the task specifications by estimating the intended user goal via an inverse control problem. *overall project* these vacancies are part of the flexcraft program funded by the netherlands organization for scientific research (nwo). the goal of the program is to develop new robotics solutions for agriculture and food processing, where robots must be able to handle a substantial variation in shape, size and hardness of the different products, which is still a major challenge for the current robotics technology. the research aims at developing generic skills for robots to enable them to perform operations like automated harvesting of tomatoes, processing and packaging of meat and the packaging of bags of crisps and boxes of biscuits. the flexcraft program builds on a unique consortium of universities and companies including: wageningen universiteit & research, eindhoven university of technology, delft university of technology, university of twente, university of amsterdam, abb, agrifoodtech platform, aris bv, blueprint automation, cellar land, cerescon, demcon, festo, gmv, houdijk holland, marel stork poultry processing, maxon motor, priva, protonic holland, rijk zwaan, and 3duniversum. for more details and instructions on how to apply see https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.academictransfer.com_en_51387_phd-2dforce-2dinteraction-2dand-2dbi-2dmanual-2dcontrol_&d=dwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=knxdu3jj9dl0knkh_dudsi5jlpxteamw1na8ggdhh3m&s=feedh0j4z89jhk7la3gpjkg_3c6qlf93ssvzytsemha&e= and https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.academictransfer.com_en_51388_phd-2dimitation-2dlearning-2dand-2dinverse-2dcontrol_&d=dwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=knxdu3jj9dl0knkh_dudsi5jlpxteamw1na8ggdhh3m&s=hok4xo1_rj6s2s88e9alezfppzy6zf-c5tesckbjjrs&e= --  dr.-ing. jens kober assistant professor, cognitive robotics department delft university of technology mekelweg 2 (3me building, office f-2-340) 2628 cd delft, the netherlands tel.: +31 (0)15 27 85150 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.jenskober.de&d=dwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=knxdu3jj9dl0knkh_dudsi5jlpxteamw1na8ggdhh3m&s=mioj2rxqnv8wbvxjgwmtlvtxgxjdwsejhaac93vbxcc&e="

106,2019,"phd position ""bringing swarms of tiny  drones to the real world"" at the mavlab of tu delft, the netherlands"," the faculty of aerospace engineering  of delft university of technology, the netherlands, announces a vacancy for one ph.d. student within the project:   *bringing swarms of tiny drones to the real world* *description of the project:*  the primary goal is to develop a swarm of tiny drones that can operate fully autonomously for long periods in an indoor environment. considerable progress to this goal has been made over the past 10 years by the mavlab (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__mavlab.tudelft.nl&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=rrl0l22czt0u65uwlppr3y2uv2xdxt0hdzsexp5kvf4&s=i9xkfolz2vnlvkbuoib5yxxoxw3a5b9hgvrbenokcza&e=), including the development of extremely light-weight vision systems as on the fully autonomous 20-gram delfly explorer [1], and methods for drones in a swarm to localize with respect to each other by means of small onboard communication chips [2,3]. although this and other work in the literature has provided a basis that could be used in a fully autonomous, long-term operating swarm of tiny drones, there are still many challenges on the way there. for the current project, we aim to develop a system that will allow tiny drones to fly autonomously in an indoor space, where they should be able to record onboard their observations of the space in which they fly. the drones should be able to return to a base station in order to recharge and upload their observations to a central computer, which collects the data for the application at hand. the drones will have to be able to explore their environment, return to base, avoid obstacles, and coordinate with other drones. the algorithms used onboard of the drones will likely be heavily bio-inspired and will involve machine learning components. the project will be carried out within the control and simulation section of the faculty of aerospace engineering, with a big experimental component, testing out the developments in a real-world environment. the start of the project will focus on bringing the navigation components of the drones to a technological readiness level (trl) of 6, by the definition of horizon 2020, i.e., ?technology demonstrated in relevant environment?. this level of robustness, which will involve significant flight testing, is necessary to start on subsequent parts of the research plan, where we envisage a trl of 4-5. the supervisors will be dr. guido de croon and ir. christophe de wagter from the micro air vehicle laboratory.  *what do we ask? * we are looking for a candidate with an msc degree in an area such as robotics, aerospace engineering, artificial intelligence, computer science, mechatronics, control systems theory, or a similar field. the candidate is expected to be passionate about developing autonomous robots, not only focusing on the ai or control algorithms, but also on hands-on development and flight testing. programming experience is required in matlab/python and/or c/c++. it is very much appreciated if the candidate has experience working with or designing electronics and / or drone hardware. previous experience with robotic or mechatronic systems and their control is an asset. please note that the ph.d. candidate will work within a team with ample experience in design and prototyping of tiny drones, autopilots (in particular paparazzi) and micro-electronics as well as with bio-inspired artificial intelligence and control. the candidate must have strong analytical skills and must be able to work at the intersection of several research domains (artificial intelligence, control, mechatronics, mechanical design, aerospace). a very good command of the english language is required, as well as excellent communication skills.  *what do we offer? * we offer the opportunity to do scientifically challenging research in a multi-disciplinary research group. the appointment will be for a period of 4 years. as an employee of the university you will receive a competitive salary, as well as excellent secondary benefits in accordance with the collective agreement (cao) of the association of universities in the netherlands (vsnu). your gross salary in the first year will be according to the first step of the standard dutch salary scale for a phd candidate, which is currently ? 2,325.00 gross per month (approximately ? 1,856.00 net) excluded the 30% rule. in the second year, your salary will be increased to ? 2,709.00 gross. this salary is to increase further in your third and fourth year. assistance with accommodation can be arranged. *how to apply?*  submit your application to dr. guido de croon (email: g.c.h.e.decroon at tudelft.nl ) before may 21st 2019 with ?swarming phd? in the subject. include a cover letter along with a detailed curriculum vitae, a separate motivation letter stating why the proposed research topic interests you, electronic links to or copies of a few selected publications (if applicable), an overview of possible ?hobby projects?

vacancy number 3me19-38 * in the future warehouses and stores, mobile manipulators will perform complex tasks in environments shared with humans. traditionally task scheduling and manipulation have been decoupled from motion planning. yet, when robots navigate in critical and dynamic environments, plans may have to be adapted online to take into account congestion, interaction with other robots and human co-workers/customers and interaction with the objects being manipulated. you will devise methods for motion planning that schedule plans for the robots and adapt them online taking into account the priority of tasks, their associated uncertainty and the preferences and needs of human co-workers or customers (e.g., the robot may push a trolley to the side to let a customer pass or modify its position to continue performing its task without causing any inconvenience to the customer). the goal is to have an integrated approach for motion planning in uncertain and dynamic environments, which accounts for complex manipulation, navigation and coordination tasks, and that provides performance guarantees (in expectation). research approach: - global planning: sampling-based path planning with guarantees - local planning and manipulation: real-time nonlinear constrained optimization - machine learning for models of human/customer behavior -

3me19-39 * complex dynamic environments warrant complex, multi-facetted robot software control architectures. the heterogeneity of components and multitude of interactions (internal and external) makes static, hand-crafted software architectures prone to failure. in this project, you will explore model-based systems engineering methods to capture the robot control architecture, its mission and its non-functional requirements (safety, reliability) @design-time, and then research symbolic reasoning and ontologies for the robot to adapt its control architecture @runtime. the architectural self-adaptation allows online software reconfiguration to overcome component-failures, unexpected environment changes and varying mission requirements. this mission-driven adaptability will lead to highly reliable and safe autonomous behaviour. the use of symbolic reasoning at the architectural level will enable explainable autonomous control. research approach: - mission and non-functional requirements (reliability, safety): model-based systems engineering methods (sysml) - self-adaptation @runtime: ontologies and symbolic reasoning methods - software platform: ros2. information if you have specific questions about this position, please contact prof. martijn wisse, e-mail: m.wisse at tudelft.nl or assistant professor dr. carlos hernandez, e-mail: c.h.corbato at tudelft.nl. please do not send application emails here, but use application-3me at tudelft.nl. * phd3: predictive vehicle routing for on-demand logistics * gradually, maturing robotic technology will enable large-scale deployments of highly-automated systems for logistics. fleets of autonomous mobile robots can be leveraged to make industrial intralogistics more flexible and more efficient and fleets of automated on-demand vehicles can disrupt urban commerce by providing last-mile deliveries faster and cheaper than what is possible using traditional delivery channels. to fully realize the benefits of such large-scale multi-robot systems, novel analytical and control techniques are needed. in this project, you will research methods that allow to make principled decisions about design parameters of such systems, and to control vehicles in the system, such that the desired trade-off between the fleet composition, operation cost, and system performance is achieved. research approach: - you will employ tools from combinatorial optimization to design dynamic vehicle routing methods for multiple vehicles (potentially autonomous and of different types) and tasks. the methods will include rebalancing of vehicles. - you will develop machine learning tools to model and address the stochasticity in the system, e.g. in travel time or prediction of tasks. - you will use as case study a large dutch retailer. information if you have specific questions about this position, please contact assistant professor dr. javier alonso-mora, e-mail: j.alonsomora at tudelft.nl, web: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.alonsomora.com&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=ismmwhwj5rczoa_a3he6tkgn2gfty9o728qcqid9buk&s=o9ruvkng81d4t-ujjxyits0zwjiqkhcyg0-cxuieocy&e=.  please do not send application emails here, but use application-3me at tudelft.nl. -- dr. carlos hernandez corbato, assistant professor cognitive robotics | delft university of technology mekelweg 2, 2628 cd delft, the netherlands +31 (0)15 27 81 053 | c.h.corbato at tudelft.nl<mailto:c.h.corbato at tudelft.nl> --"

115,2019,post-doctoral position on behaviour  change support systems for children," dear robotics researchers, we are searching for a postdoctoral fellow on:  behaviour change support systems for children.  social robotics is expected to be an important part of such a system. this 2-year long post-doc research position aims to explore novel and advanced forms of personalization in designing behaviour change support systems for children users. the project shall extend current approaches to persuasion profiling, where persuasion strategy is adapted to an individual's personality, in two ways: first, it will seek child-appropriate ways of creating persuasion profiles, addressing issues related to their developing cognition, ethics, and making such solutions engaging. second, it will seek to account for intra-personal variation across contexts and situations. depending on the interests of the post-doctoral researcher, we shall address specific behavior change challenges for children in areas relating to learning and rehabilitation. next to addressing the research challenge above, they will be contributing to the department's efforts to develop relevant stakeholder networks and track record in this field. background in rehabilitation, behavior change is a key element to ensuring adherence and the effectiveness of therapy. for example, encouraging a rehabilitating patient to take a walk which might be beneficial for their well-being and vitality, and will be more efficient if a personalized model of context is taken into account for choosing which behaviour change strategy to apply. similarly in education increasing children's motivation, or perseverance during studying/practice may be key to achieving higher learning outcomes. currently, persuasion profiling has addressed healthy adult users only. applying this technique to vulnerable populations who stand most to benefit from behavior change programs (e.g. consider rehabilitating children), demands higher attention to allowing users to make the personalization approach engaging, protecting their privacy and ensuring meaningful and relevant management of the profiling behavior of the system. ensuring intelligibility and accountability of persuasion profiling for vulnerable individuals presents complex design and ethical challenges. our intended scientific contribution pertains both to the specific solutions as well as the design research methodology used. during the project, the candidate will work closely with the project team, panos markopoulos, emilia barakova, and javed vassilis khan, and will seek collaborations in and outside the department. for more details, see the following link: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__jobs.tue.nl_en_vacancy_postdoctoral-2dposition-2don-2dbehaviour-2dchange-2dsupport-2dsystems-2dfor-2dchildren-2d6&d=dwifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=i0cyzuzk2eaep7mdh_o5q27broekrerqyvsyy_enxo0&s=ttdfs1pqsxewqa04v1nttgpmk59jrzgtog1smev7ygo&e=  kind regards, emilia i. barakova,  faculty of industrial design,  eindhoven university of technology  atlas floor4 room 3.122, 5612 az eindhoven the netherlands, head tue social robotics lab, editor personal and ubiquitous computing, associate editor international journal of social robotics, program chair icsr 2019? ===========attend icsr 2019=============="

(feedback) between planned  and actual motion, providing robustness against all the effects that  could not be considered at the planning stage. while there has been an  effort in proposing ?robust planners? or more ?global controllers?  (e.g., model predictive control (mpc)), a truly unified approach that  fully exploits the techniques of the motion planning and  control/estimation communities is still missing and the existing  state-of-the-art has several important limitations, namely (1) lack of  generality, (2) lack of computational efficiency, and (3) poor  robustness. all these shortcomings are a major limiting factor in the  autonomy and decision-making capabilities of robots operating in all  those complex scenarios (real-world conditions, non-negligible effects  of the uncertainties, fast dynamics) which are instead the typical  conditions in which future robots are expected to operate. in this context, the goal of this phd will be to contribute to the  development of a general and unified ?intrinsically-robust and  control-aware motion planning framework? for addressing the  above-mentioned issues and demonstrating the applicability of this new  framework to real robots in real-world challenging tasks. this phd position is part of a 4-year research project recently funded  by anr (the french funding agency). the project is in cooperation with  the ris team at laas-cnrs and the robotics and mechatronics group at the  univ. of twente, netherlands. *********** phd topic *********** the work will start from our previous contributions where we introduced  the notion of ?closed-loop state sensitivity? and showed how this  quantity can be used as an effective ?parametric uncertainty metric? for  generating motion plans that are intrinsically robust to variations in  the robot model parameters. the phd student is then expected to expand  on these topics along several lines and also work towards an  experimental validation on two robotic demonstrators: (1) an indoor  pick- and-place/assembly task involving a 7-dof torque-controlled and  (2) an outdoor cooperative mobile manipulation task involving an aerial  manipulator (a quadrotor uav equipped with an onboard arm) and a  skid-steering mobile robot with an onboard arm. these validations will  be done in cooperation with the other partners of the project. please find more details about the phd planned activities at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/ctrl_aware_plan/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bappog_ku$  *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must hold (or be close to the completion of) a m.sc.  degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied mathematics  (or related fields). the starting date of the position is flexible and can be delayed until  the fall 2021 should a suitable candidate be found. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/algorithmic* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving in robotics and applied math. in  particular, strong experience in some of the areas is certainly sought:  nonlinear control, optimization, and/or planning for robotics. good knowledge of c/c++ and ros is required, and familiarity with  matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-batnlzbck$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experiences in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision and sensor-based control for robotics  applications. the facilities available in the group include three 6-dof  industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof torque-controlled backdrivable arm,  two 7-dof torque-controlled robot arm (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile  robot, a humanoid robot (pepper), a fleet of quadrotor uavs and an  indoor testing arena instrumented with vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bavq45ynf$  *dr. quentin delamare* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/quentin-delamare/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-baionkee7$  *prof. antonio franchi* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ram.eemcs.utwente.nl/about-us/staff/antonio-franchi__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-balej6b2g$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the rainbow  group involved in the project, as well as the member of the other  project partners (ris team at laas and robotics and mechatronics group  at the univ. of twente, netherlands). the rainbow group is part of the inria/irisa lab that spreads its  activities in 30 research teams working in computer science, signal  processing, and control. it involves about 650 people, including 120  professors and assistant professors, 100 full-time researchers, 80  administrative staff, and 250 phd students. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/ctrl_aware_plan/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bappog_ku$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bavq45ynf$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-baumxdgtk$ "
167,2021,phd position at tu eindhoven on  verifiable estimation and control for autonomous systems," we have a fully funded 4 year long phd position available at the control systems group at tu eindhoven in the netherlands. the aim of this phd project is to develop missing theory and tools towards the goal of having verifiable autonomous control systems that can learn from data. emerging applications in robotics, aerospace and autonomous driving necessitate control systems capable of autonomously performing complex tasks. these control systems need to learn and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. in this phd project, the focus lies on developing the missing theory to enable the formal verification of such autonomous control systems. autonomous driving is a key application area in which theory needs to be developed to improve the verifiability and safety of autonomous control systems. safe driving maneuvers can be expressed as dynamic constraints using temporal logics. these temporal logic specifications combine logical operations with temporal modalities based on constraints over control system's states and outputs and can be automatically verified using formal methods. however, while driving a car, inherent uncertainty is encountered that necessitates the inclusion of learning and estimation strategies. verifying and designing such learning controllers is an open research problem for complex driving maneuvers or control tasks. this project aims to build a framework for the safe and verifiable design of controllers for systems with state and model uncertainty. the objective of the phd research is to exploit advanced system identification and filtering techniques (kalman filtering, bayesian estimation, machine learning) together with control techniques (approximate dynamic programming, lyapunov stability, temporal logics) to improve the resilience of verifiable design methodologies to uncertainty. the research also involves some laboratory work in terms of implementation and validation on small-scale vehicles. for more information see: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/phd-position-on-verifiable-estimation-and-control-for-autonomous-systems-875257.html__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8wmfd8gavnfl1n7vow4n2p5quv6w5bhynwkizgle5t0hmaajgdlsrjt4prkw8z6c7c4jdwna$  dr. ir. sofie haesaert assistant professor tu eindhoven"
