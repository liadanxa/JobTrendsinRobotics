king abdullah university of science and technology (kaust)
faculty openings in computer science and applied mathematics

king abdullah university of science and technology (kaust) is being
established in saudi arabia as an international graduate-level research
university dedicated to inspiring a new age of scientific achievement that
will benefit the region and the world. as an independent and merit-based
institution and one of the best endowed universities in the world, kaust
intends to become a major new contributor to the global network of
collaborative research. it will enable researchers from around the globe to
work together to solve challenging scientific and technological problems.
the admission of students, the appointment, promotion and retention of
faculty and staff, and all the educational, administrative and other
activities of the university shall be conducted on the basis of equality,
without regard to race, color, religion or gender.

kaust is located on the red sea at thuwal (80km north of jeddah). opening in
september 2009, kaust welcomes exceptional researchers, faculty and students
from around the world. to be competitive, kaust will offer very attractive
base salaries and a wide range of benefits. further information about kaust
can be found at http://www.kaust.edu.sa/.

kaust invites applications for faculty position at all ranks (assistant,
associate, full) in applied mathematics (with domain applications in the
modeling of biological, physical, engineering, and financial systems) and
computer science, including areas such as computational mathematics,
high-performance scientific computing, optimization, computer systems,
software engineering, algorithms and computing theory, artificial
intelligence, graphics, databases, human-computer interaction,  computer
vision and perception, robotics, and bio-informatics (this list is not
exhaustive).  kaust is also interested in applicants doing research at the
interface of computer science and applied mathematics with other science and
engineering disciplines. high priority will be given to the overall
originality and promise of the candidate's work rather than the candidate's
sub-area of specialization within applied mathematics and computer science.

an earned ph.d. in applied mathematics, computer science, computational
mathematics, computational science and engineering, or a related field,
evidence of the ability to pursue a program of research, and a strong
commitment to graduate teaching are required.  a successful candidate will
be expected to teach courses at the graduate level and to build and lead a
team of graduate students in master's and ph.d. research.

applications should include a curriculum vita, brief statements of research
and teaching interests, and the names of at least 3 references for an
assistant professor position, 6 references for an associate professor
position, and 9 references for a full professor position.  candidates are
requested to ask references to send their letters directly to the search
committee.  applications and letters should be sent via electronic mail to
kaust-search at stanford.edu.  the review of applications will begin
immediately, and applicants are strongly encouraged to submit applications
as soon as possible; however, applications will continue to be accepted
until december 2009, or all 10 available positions have been filled.

in 2008 and 2009, as part of an academic excellence alliance agreement
between kaust and stanford university, the kaust faculty search will be
conducted by a committee consisting of professors from the computer science
department and the institute of computational and mathematical engineering
at stanford university. this committee will select the top applicants and
nominate them for faculty positions at kaust. however, kaust will be
responsible for actual recruiting decisions, appointment offers, and
explanations of employment benefits. the recruited faculty will be employed
by kaust, not by stanford. faculty members in applied mathematics and
computer science recruited by kaust before september 2009 will be hosted at
stanford university as visiting fellows until kaust opens in september 2009.
at stanford, these visiting fellows will conduct research with stanford
faculty and will occasionally teach courses.
