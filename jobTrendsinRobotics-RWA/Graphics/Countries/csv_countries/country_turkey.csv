this project is entitled ""rossi; emergence of communication in robots 
through sensorimotor and social interaction"", and focuses on the 
development of communication between robots and humans 
(http://www.rossiproject.eu).
in particular, the project is addressing the question of how critical it 
is for communicating agents to share the same general view of the world. 
  agents possessing different sensory and motor systems may have 
different views of the world and therefore may have difficulties in 
communicating. we are exploring to what extent and which aspects of 
world models must be shared in order to facilitate communication between 
robots and humans.  we wish to increase understanding of the 
requirements of affordance based world models, shared models and 
communication provided by such models, based on understanding of 
objects, actions, and processes in their environment. the focus of this 
project is the construction of robots that are able to process simple 
commands and to respond appropriately by interacting with different 
kinds of objects and entities in their environment. this project has 6 
partners in italy, germany,  sweden  and turkey, involving psychologists, 
neuroscientists, computer scientists and robotics engineers. we are 
involved in all stages but especially the implementation of the models 
in a robotic manipulation system and the testing and experimentation 
with real application tasks.

we wish to appoint a post-doctoral research associate who will take 
major responsibility for the programme of research in the context of our 
robotics team.  this post is available on a three-year fixed-term 
contract. we expect to appoint for a start date of 1 march 2008.

- applicants should have a doctorate in computer science, artificial 
intelligence, engineering, or a related scientific field, and be able to 
demonstrate research experience.
- the post requires excellent software skills for the implementation and 
running of a range of experimental components.
- the successful applicant will also be involved in writing scientific 
documents and papers and will be expected to travel and give 
presentations as necessary.

27,2021,open postdoctoral researcher positions," *dear all* robotics and mechatronics laboratory at koc university in istanbul is looking for a talented and motivated post-doctoral research fellows in the following areas: a) human-robot haptic interaction b) surface haptics. in addition to have a background in one of those areas, the fellow is expected to have practical experience in machine/deep learning techniques and software libraries. *intention detection for physical human-robot interaction * *using machine/deep learning* cobots (collaborative robots) are designed with the aim to integrate human cognitive abilities and quick adaptation skills with the speed, strength, and repeatability of robots. as cobots penetrate into different domains such as manufacturing, logistics, medicine, home use, etc, it is becoming increasingly clear that the skills expected from them are significantly different from what is expected from industrial robots. in fact, many of these skills centers on the challenge of interacting with humans. in particular, understanding human intention during a collaborative task and then adjusting the interaction controller of the cobot accordingly to comply with human intention is a major challenge in physical human-robot interaction (phri). *the post-doctoral fellow is expected to design human-human and human-robot experiments, collect data from various sensors, and develop models based on machine/deep learning techniques to estimate human intention during a collaborative manipulation task. she/he is expected to have research experience in robotics, ai, and machine/deep learning with background in cs, ee, or me.* *some related references:* 1.     sirintuna, d., ozdamar, i., aydin, y., basdogan, c., 2020, ?detecting human motion

haptic feedback on touch surfaces using machine/deep learning* haptics for interactive touch surfaces, also known as surface haptics, is a new area of research in the field of haptics. the goal of surface haptics is to generate tactile effects on touch surfaces such as those used in mobile phones, tablets, kiosks and information displays, and front panels of new generation home appliances and cars. integration of haptics into touch surfaces will result in new applications in user interface design, online shopping, gaming and entertainment, education, arts, and more. currently, one of the most promising techniques to generate tactile effects on a touch surface is electrostatic actuation.  when an alternating voltage is applied to the conductive layer of a capacitive touch screen, an attractive electrostatic force is generated in the normal direction between the finger and the surface. by controlling the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of the input voltage, the frictional force between the sliding finger and the touch screen can be modulated. in this context, one important aim is to render realistic virtual textures on touch screens (see the figure below). texture information on touch screens would improve the user experience in daily activities. for example, feeling the simulated texture of a jean before purchasing it from internet would certainly be more motivating for online shoppers. despite the current advances in hardware, tactile rendering algorithms have yet to reach the realism necessary to simulate a wide range of textures due to variations in their a) physical attributes (e.g. roughness, kurtosis, skewness, etc.), b) psychological attributes (e.g. fine, course, smooth, sticky, etc.) and c) affective attributes (e.g. cool, wavy, granular, repetitive, elegant, etc.). *the post-doctoral fellow is expected to design experiments to collect data from real textured surfaces and develop machine/deep learning algorithms to generate their virtual counterparts by establishing the links between those attributes. she/he is expected to have research experience in human-computer interaction, surface haptics, texture modeling and rendering, and machine/deep learning with background in cs, ee, or me.* *some related references:* 1.     basdogan, c., giraud, f., levesque, v., choi, s., 2020, ?a review of surface haptics: enabling tactile
