1,2007,post. doc. jobs in active sonar in denmark and belgium,"active sonar perception inspired by bats

... at universiteit antwerpen, antwerpen, belgium, and university of
southern denmark (sdu), odense, denmark in the framework of the eu
project chiroping (01/02/2008 -- 31/01/2011).

chiroping is a multidisciplinary research collaboration between 4
universities in the area of sensing for autonomous systems.

the principal objective of the project is to discover how to engineer
embodied active sonar perception systems which can serve as a complement
to vision and facilitate the deployment of robotic systems in situations
where vision is infeasible.

the project will implement and evaluate two demonstration systems built
as biomimetic models of an insect gleaning and a water-trawling bat
species respectively. it will use a classic biomimetic methodology,
involving close collaboration between bat ethologists and roboticists.
it will proceed by identifying and measuring the relevant acoustic and
morphological parameters of a few carefully selected bat species,
reconstructing from that the bat's acoustic experience as it flies
through natural hunting tasks. from this data, computational models of
how the bat coordinates its acoustic, behavioural and morphological
choices during hunting will be elicited and implemented on appropriate
robotic systems.

5,2009,several phd positions at ghent university,"several fully funded ph.d. positions in machine learning, speech  
recognition, handwriting recognition and robotics are available at the  
reservoir lab (http://reslab.elis.ugent.be) and the speech lab (http://speech.elis.ugent.be 
), both part of the electronics and information systems department,  
faculty of engineering of the ghent university, belgium (http:// 
ugent.be).

project
current state-of-the-art speech & handwriting recognition systems  
still perform much worse than human beings who can effortlessly decode  
the speech or handwriting of most people, even in fairly adverse  
conditions (e.g. the presence of noise in case of speech recognition).  
the fact that the human brain works so efficiently is owed to its self- 
organizing capacity, its deeply hierarchical approach, its adoption of  
unsupervised and supervised learning strategies, its capacity to adapt  
almost instantly to new circumstances, etc. why not try to build an  
automatic speech recognizer and handwriting recognition engine that  
incorporates the same principles? this is exactly what we will do in  
two recently approved projects:

* “self-organized recurrent neural learning for language  
processing” (organic), funded by the european commission within the  
7th framework program. details about the project can be found at the  
preliminary reservoir computing website (http://reservoir- 
computing.org).
* “reservoir computing for auditory pattern recognition” (recap),  
funded by the research program of the research foundation - flanders  
(fwo).

the research concerns the investigation of architectures and  
algorithms for the efficient learning of large recurrent neural  
networks based on the reservoir computing concept (where only a linear  
readout layer is learned in a supervised way whereas the recurrent  
connections are fixed or trained in an unsupervised way). important  
research topics are the unsupervised learning of a large hierarchy of  
recurrent sub-layers, and the integration of various adaptation  
techniques. the application domains are off-line handwriting  
recognition, speech recognition and various aspects of robotics (such  
as robot localization, motion control, ...). so far we were able to  
demonstrate that reservoirs can give rise to the robust recognition of  
digits spoken or written in isolation, but now we want to demonstrate  
that they can also yield robust recognition of continuous speech and  
handwriting (large vocabulary).

requirements
candidates should have a masters degree in electrical, computer or  
physics engineering; or in physics, mathematics or computer science. a  
good knowledge of english is essential. no professional background is  
required, but the ideal candidates have some acquaintance with machine  
learning, programming (python, matlab, ...), statistics, signal  
processing, speech recognition, control engineering, or robotics.

what we offer
we offer an opportunity to perform at least three years of research in  
a new promising domain, and to get a doctoral degree in this domain.  
there will be ample opportunities for establishing international  
contacts (stays at partner universities, participation to  
international conferences). as an employee of the university you will  
receive a competitive salary (starting with a net monthly salary of  
approximately 1.600€) as well as excellent secondary benefits (holiday  
allowance, etc.). belgium was ranked first on the “best countries for  
academic research” worldwide list (the scientist, 2007), and ghent  
university was appointed second place on the “best places to work in  
academia” non-us list (the scientist, 2006).

application and timing
if you are interested in one of the ph.d. vacancies, please send in  
electronic format to benjamin schrauwen (benjamin “dot” schrauwen “at”  
ugent “dot” be): a detailed curriculum vitae, a motivation letter,  
your course program, your grades, two letters of recommendation and,  
if applicable, a publication list and selected publications. do also  
mention your topics of preferences within the projects (e.g. robotics,  
speech, no preference, etc.). some positions start on april 1, 2009,  
others in september 2009, meaning that persons who expect to graduate  
in july 2009 are welcome to apply. applications which are received  
before february 1, 2009 get priority.

10,2011,"phd position in rehabilitation robotics at uclouvain, belgium","phd position in rehabilitation robotics at uclouvain, belgium

the centre for research in mechatronics at uclouvain (belgium) is 
seeking applications for a phd position in rehabilitation robotics, 
offered in the framework of a european project on a cognitive prosthesis 
design. the position should start as soon as possible, and no later than 
the 1st of february, 2012. the position is fully funded and will involve 
strong interactions with the project partners: scuola superiore 
sant'anna (pisa, italy), vrije universiteit brussel (belgium), rizzoli 
ortopedia (italy), and univerza v ljubljani (ljubljana,  slovenia ).

project topic

the goal of the project is to develop an intelligent, cognitive 
prosthesis for lower-limb amputees. this high-performance device will 
combine cutting-edge properties like energy efficient (through compliant 
elements), user-intention detection, intuitive interaction, and 
maximization of the user's safety.
ucl is mainly in charge of the controller design. this work will be 
completed in collaboration with a postdoc and will require the design of 
an advanced controller, multibody, physics-oriented simulations of the 
user/device interactions, and experimental activities (both with healthy 
and impaired participants) carried out with the group of rehabilitation 
& physical medicine (institute of neuroscience) at ucl.

this work will be validated with a novel mechatronic device relying on a 
new type of sensory integration. both will be developed by our partners, 
such that strong interactions will be required during the whole project.

requested profile

we are seeking candidates with an msc degree in mechanical/biomedical 
engineering, mechatronics or a related discipline, with a strong 
background in controls, mechanical simulation (e.g. multibody dynamics) 
and robotics. good programming skills and/or experiences in experimental 
investigations with humans are a plus. good communication skills are 
further required in this project, due to its collaborative framework. 
having the capacity to act independently and to take initiatives is more 
than welcome.

what we offer

- a highly dynamic working environment, in a friendly international 
university city
- a framework to boost intensive collaborations with the project 
partners, but also with other partners at the national and european level
- a competitive salary and social benefits
- a high-quality graduate training in mechanics and/or dynamical systems

how to apply

your application should be sent by e-mail to renaud ronsse

general information
-----------------------------------------------
a phd studentship is available in swarm robotics at the iridia-code, the artificial intelligence lab of the  université libre de bruxelles, belgium. 
swarm robotics is inspired by the observation of social insects (e.g. ants, termites, wasps and bees) which stand as fascinating examples of how collectively intelligent systems can be generated from a large number of simple individuals. as in their natural counterpart, the robots used in swarm robotics are relatively simple, with local and limited sensing and communication abilities. it is a natural consequence of these individual characteristics that the overall systems are robust against failures of individuals and scalable with group size. the student will work within a scenario in which robots are given a task whose solution requires strict cooperation, studying how a swarm robotics system can adapt to different tasks, varying environmental conditions, varying numbers and types of robots, and to different levels of malfunctioning of the robots.

the student we are looking for should possess a degree that allows to embark in a doctoral program (doctoral student positions). the area of  competence should be in at least one of the following disciplines:  computer science, computational intelligence, electrical engineering,  cognitive sciences. a master's degree with research experience is an asset. the student should have a strong background in computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other relevant computational disciplines. in particular, she/he should demonstrate very strong programming skills in one or more major computer languages. good communication and team-working skills are essential.

phd opening, design and control continuum robots for minimal invasive surgical applications, ku leuven, belgium

the department of mechanical engineering at the university of leuven (ku leuven), belgium, is pleased to offer a fully
funded phd scholarship to ""design and control continuum robots for minimal invasive surgical applications"". the successful applicant will
receive a phd scholarship for 4 years.

phd topic:
recent efforts in robotics and automation research have fostered the development of a wide variety of bio-inspired snake-like continuum robots. miniature continuum robots can access confined spaces and, thanks to their compliance, follow complex trajectories exchanging limited forces with the surroundings. these properties explain the appeal of these robots in surgical applications and minimal invasive surgery in particular, where critical tasks are to be executed within the delicate and complex environment of the human body.

compared to rigid robots, precise position and force control of these compliant robots is much more involved. it calls for an integrated approach combining accurate robot proprioception (self-awareness) with improved exteroception and 3d reconstruction of the robot's complex, deformable and often dynamic environment. by looking at new mechanisms for actuation, sensing and control, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and control over the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings. the conducted research will be applied on cardiovascular robotic catheter-based interventions within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.

29,2013,ph.d. position in ethics of robotics (with a focus on robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders),"the department of philosophy of the university of twente in the netherlands
is looking for a ph.d. student in ethics of robotics, with a focus on
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

your profile

a master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy (preferably but not
exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues
relating to  human-robot interaction.  highly motivated to become part of
an international team of researchers and to contribute to the success of
the dream project. good analytical skills. good organizational skills. good
communication skills in english, in writing as well as orally. creativity,
open-mindedness and ability to develop new ideas.

our offer

we offer you a four-year full-time ph.d. position, starting in 2014 (the
exact starting date will be communicated during the interview) and at the
end you should have completed your phd thesis the gross salary is € 2.083,-

professional and personal development, a holiday allowance (amounts to 8%),
an end-of-year bonus (amounts to 8,3%) an a number of additional benefits.
the position also comes with a travel budget.

information and application

for information you can contact the research  leader of the “ethics” work
package, dr. m.j.k coeckelbergh (e-mail: m.j.k.coeckelbergh at utwente.nl)

we propose a theory and a hardware implementation of probabilistic 
computation inspired by biochemical cell signaling. we will study 
probabilistic computation following three axes: algebra, biology, and 
hardware. in each case, we will develop a bottom-up hierarchical 
approach starting from the elementary components, and study how to 
combine them to build more complex systems. we propose bayesian gates 
operating on probability distributions on binary variables as the 
building blocks of our probabilistic algebra. these bayesian gates can 
be seen as a generalization of logical operators in boolean algebra. we 
propose to interpret elementary cell signaling pathways as biological 
implementation of these probabilistic gates. in turn, the key features 
of biochemical processes give new insights for innovative probabilistic 
hardware implementation. we propose to associate conventional 
electronics and novel stochastic nano-devices to build the required 
hardware elements. combining them will lead to new artificial 
information processing systems, which could, in the future, outperform 
classical computers in tasks involving a direct interaction with the 
physical world. for these purposes, the bambi project associates 
research in bayesian probability theory, molecular biology, nanophysics, 
computer science and electronics.

this project is open to an engineer interested to image analysis. vaginal birth leads to a number of injuries to the nerves, fascia and pelvic floor muscles. this project is focused on the early detection of injuries by automated image analysis of pelvic floor ultrasound images, as well on the quantification of repairs, again using imaging (both mr as well as ultrasound). background knowledge of the clinical problem is not needed;

the primary outcome is brain structure and function; secondary measures are lung function. the clinical relevance lays in the current availability to identify fetuses at risk for (late) preterm delivery and predict their risk for neonatal respiratory distress, hence take preventive action to avoid the latter, yet may have an effect on subsequent brain function. required profile: physician, biomedical scientist, image analysis specialist (for the processing of neonatal mr or statistician for pharmacokinetic/dynamic studies. the team is multidisciplinary. the deadline for this application is 31/1/2017, with selection in the months thereafter and start of the contract at the latest 10/2017, yet earlier is possible. you should in the case you are considering the leuven group as the primary place to work, indicate that."

31th, however we will start already the assessment and fill in positions, so please apply fast when interested. the smart innovative training network is recruiting 15 motivated phd students. smart is a joint venture between academia and industry, providing scientific and personal development of young researchers in the multidisciplinary fields of soft robotics and smart materials. smart will realize the technologically and scientifically ambitious breakthroughs to exploit smart, stimuli-responsive material systems with actuation, sensing and self-healing capabilities for intelligent soft devices. this allows the soft robots to interact with dynamic and unknown environments in a smart fashion to avert catastrophic failure and re-establish structural integrity and operational functionality. control intelligence enables interaction with the outer world and structural health monitoring allows the establishment of autonomous healing procedures, where upon sensing of damage or loss of functionality the system will cease operation and start a repair action, followed by the evaluation of the effective recovery of functionality and finally return to operation, thus expanding the service lifetime. these technologies will be integrated in fully functional and autonomous demonstrators to disseminate, benchmark and exploit the results. there is a need for future leaders with excellence in smart material systems and technologically advanced applications such as robotics and automation. the smart itn offers such multidisciplinary training by combining these two emerging fields with meaningful societal and economic impact (t-model). for this purpose, smart brings together 8 beneficiaries and 11 partner organizations including 2 research institutes and 12 private companies, belonging to 7 eu member states, and to 2 associated states (switzerland, turkey). the consortium?s complementarity and multidisciplinarity will enable a top-level educational programme, with special focus on spanning trl levels from innovative fundamentally new concepts to system prototypes and teaching them in a responsible research and innovation (rri) spirit. benefits and salary the successful candidates will receive an attractive salary in accordance with the msca regulations for early stage researchers

invasive procedures (ref.bap-2020-821) *************************************** phd topic: recent efforts in robotics and automation research have fostered the development of a wide variety of bio-inspired snake-like continuum robots. miniature continuum robots can access confined spaces and, thanks to their compliance, follow complex trajectories exchanging limited forces with the surroundings. these properties explain the appeal of these robots in surgical applications and minimal invasive surgery in particular, where critical tasks are to be executed within the delicate and complex environment of the human body. compared to rigid robots, precise position and force control of these compliant robots is much more involved. it calls for an integrated approach combining accurate robot proprioception (self-awareness) with improved exteroception and 3d reconstruction of the robot's complex, deformable and often dynamic environment. by looking at new mechanisms for actuation, sensing and control, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and control over the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings. the conducted research will be applied on cardiovascular robotic catheter-based interventions and fetal surgical applications within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.     key words: novel actuation and sensing methods for catheters and flexible endoscopes, continuum robot control, 3d reconstruction, minimal invasive surgery, human-robot interaction. on the research group: the successful applicant

accurate robotic surgery (ref. bap-2020-806)  *************************************** phd topic: a key motivation for introducing robots in operating rooms has been their ability to deliver superhuman performance. surgical robots are able to execute highly precise gestures that rapidly and stably position instruments in many degrees of freedom (dofs). however, for the vast majority of surgical procedures, robotic positioning precision alone is not sufficient to realize the ""right gesture"". surgical plans are generally only a very idealised sketch of the intraoperative reality which is also defined by patient motion, tissue deformation, bleeding, and the like. therefore, when finally deciding where exactly to make ""the cut"" (or intervene on tissue in any other irreversible manner), surgeons ""disconnect"" from the preoperative plan. surgical teams resort to their own senses and experience. on the spot, based on the interpretation of the limited intraoperative scene, tactical decisions will be made. in this context, for orthopedic applications (e.g. pedicle screw placement), a rich set of sensors that could then form a comprehensive representative of surgical scenes can be utilized to offer the sufficient sensory information for autonomous robotic control. by looking at a wide range of smart sensors and signal processing and modelling algorithms, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings for orthopedic surgeries and formulate a consolidated strategy to fuse multi-modal sensory information and eventually design real-time control schemes. the conducted research will be applied on degenerative spine diseases for diagnosis and surgical interventions within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.     on the research group: the successful applicant will become part of the robot assisted surgery (ras) group
