8,2014,phd position in underwater robotics and experimental fluid dynamics,"ph.d. studentship in experimental fluid dynamics and marine robotics
dear ph.d. student candidate,

centre for biorobotics is a team of 15 young, skilled and well-motivated researchers and engineers in tallinn university of technology, estonia. we seek and like novel, unusual and risky ideas and new applications for underwater technology. our ideas are often inspired by nature or we use technology to better understand how nature works. for example, we have developed a robot that uses flow sensing, inspired by fish lateral line sensing, we have designed a sea turtle-inspired robot that will help underwater archaeologists to explore shipwrecks and we use a fish robot to understand how fish choose their migration routes upriver.
you can find more information about us at  http://www.biorobotics.ttu.ee<http://www.biorobotics.ttu.ee/>
we are looking for a new team member who is equally fascinated in using physics and engineering to solve practical real-world problems. the aim of your work is to give a new sense to underwater robots – flow sensing. the objective is to develop a method for sensing and analyzing flow so that the underwater robot understands the surrounding hydrodynamic environment and can react to the changes.
you are a suitable candidate if you have master degree in physics, math, robotics, computer science, computer engineering and related fields. if you are good in one of those areas, we can back you up with the complementary expertise in our lab. but you have to be good at something. if you have knowledge in fluid dynamics (experimental, analytical or computational) it makes your life a lot easier.
we are looking for someone who has an internal motivation to do good research. while good team-working skills are essential, it is also important that you are able to define your own goals while taking responsibility for achieving them, work independently for some periods, be persistent if things do not work out immediately and dare to ask for help if you are stuck.
you would be part of a large european robocademy marie-curie initial training network that gives you opportunities to access experimental facilities, knowledge and networks of outstanding european research groups and innovative companies.
if you are interested in the opportunity please see below how to apply.
yours sincerely,

young, skilled and well-motivated researchers and engineers in tallinn
university  of technology (taltech). 
we are located in tallinn, estonia, one of the fastest-growing it hubs in
europe. our team is very international and  multidisciplinary but we share
similar interests and values. 

we have two phd positions opened: 

robot locomotion in multiphase environments 

motivation. robots are usually divided into land, underwater and aerial
vehicles all of them having their specific research and engineering
challenges. the challenge almost unexplored so far is locomotion in the
mixture of those environments. 
problem definition. this phd topic explores new locomotion mechanisms for
exploring flooded abandoned mines. it involves the design, prototyping and
verification of robots. the robots will move on solid ground, in water, as
well as in the environments between them; in mud of different consistencies,
clay, oil, wet snow, loose gravel, etc. 
requirements. the successful applicant should have a m.sc. or equivalent in
mechanical engineering or mechatronics with both strong theoretical
background and hands on experience. the work will be conducted in european
union project robominers in an multinational team. we therefore are looking
for people who are good at working with others. you will need to be prepared
for  field tests in unique and challenging environments, such as stone
caves, ice caves and quarries underwater, including possibly unpleasant
weather conditions.


robot sensing in sensory-deprived and gps-denied environments 

motivation. there are extreme environmental conditions where conventional
robot sensors do not work and where there is overall very little information
available to support decision making of an autonomous robot. therefore
robots relying on unconventional sensors that can make decisions based on
very little and unreliable data are necessary.
problem definition. this phd topic involves using unconventional robotic
sensors for environments where the common sensors cannot work (e.g. caves
filled with slurry, ice caves, highly turbid water, etc.). the purpose will
be to build world models and navigate through highly uncertain underground
and underwater environments.   
requirements. the successful applicant should have a m.sc. or equivalent in
computer science, computer engineering, mechatronics or other related areas.
applicants with experience in underwater robotics or mobile robotic
platforms are preferred. apart from a strong theoretical background and
practical skills in robotics and physics, this assignment requires
independent thinking and creative problem solving. the work will be
conducted in european union project robominers in an multinational team. we
therefore are looking for people who are good at working with others.
