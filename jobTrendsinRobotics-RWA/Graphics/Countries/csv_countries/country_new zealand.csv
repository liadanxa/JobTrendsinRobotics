0,2008,one phd position in microrobotic biomanipulation and biomems,"dear all,

 

there is a fully-sponsored phd position at the department of mechanical
engineering at the university of canterbury, new zealand.

 

project description
microrobots with high positioning accuracy (at the scale of nanometers) and
biomems devices with small size (at the scale of micrometers to centimeters)
are widely used to manipulate micron-sized objects such as biological cells.
with their unparallel capabilities of manipulating cells, microrobotic
systems and biomems devices have been receiving increasingly remarkable
attention. recently, we have developed a fully automated zebrafish embryo
injection system, semi-automated adherent cell injection system, and a pdms
elastic device for cell mechanics characterization. more information can be
found at: http://individual.utoronto.ca/wangwenhui

 

field of study
the project will feature one or a combination of the following topics
according to the preference of the student: 

(1) high-throughput microrobotic parallel cell injection;
(2) microrobot-aided high-throughput cloning; 
(3) micro-fluidic devices for cell manipulation; 
(4) mems-based stem cells characterization. 

in (1) and (2), a microrobotic system based on high precision manipulators
is to be developed to manipulate/characterize biological
cells/beads/organisms with high-throughput for large-scale screening
scenarios. a successful candidate should have hands-on experience or strong
background in motion control and computer vision. 

in (3) and (4), biomems devices are to be designed and microfabricated with
the aim to manipulate/characterize biological cells. a successful candidate
should have hands-on experience or strong background in mechanical design,
integrated circuit design, or mems device design and fabrication. excellent
knowledge in sensing/actuating theories, design and simulation software (e.
g. solidworks, ansys) is a plus. 



requirement on qualifications
all candidates with high motivation, enthusiasm, and independent thinking
are welcome to apply. preference is given to students with a strong research
track record from any one of the fields: mechanical engineering, electrical
engineering, computer sciences, automation and control, mechatronics
engineering, or related disciplines. 



funding arrangements
the successful candidate will receive a full scholarship lasting 3 years,
and be expected to start as early as possible. all applications will be
considered immediately until the position is filled.

 

interested candidates please send cv to: wenhui.wang at canterbury.ac.nz.

its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone. while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system. http://www.ntnu.edu/livingintrh/about- norway  http://www.visit norway .com/en/"

communication between auvs and installations, and 4) developing, testing and demonstrating key elements of the monitoring system. the project will employ a phd student dedicated to system analysis, sampling theory and the establishment of technology requirements, and a post.doc researcher with focus on technological solutions including fully autonomous control for sampling.   the phd candidate will contribute to the project within the following areas: system analysis: analysis of the dynamical system (ocean dynamics, release, particle size distributions, transport and settling of material): temporal development, spatial extent and shape of the area of interest. this work will utilize existing mathematical model systems as simulation and test environment. sampling theory: adaptive sampling strategies for drilling scenarios, focusing on what features need to be observed at which spatial resolution to observe the system. use of simplified models through machine learning, and optimization based methods for path planning to maximize expected information value from measurements. establish methods to find optimal sampling strategies. technology requirements: establish methods to calculate the demands put by the system to be observed on the number of observation platforms, their performance and their sensor packages. job advertisement:

year, two-thirds of which are master's or phd candidates. the university has more than 100 laboratory facilities distributed among the different faculties and departments. these are central elements in ntnu's education and research work.  ntnu's research is cutting edge, and many of the technological and cultural innovations that allow  norway  to extract oil and gas from the north sea, grow healthy salmon in fish farms, or interpret the country's 9.000 years of human history have been developed here. the university itself, founded in 1910, has contributed a solid century of academic achievements and discoveries that have shaped norwegian society. itk's founder jens glad balchen is considered a pre-eminent control theorist in the world; norwegian airlines features balchen's image on the tail of a boeing 737. see also

student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture.  newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

this project, we will also explore alternative uses of structural compliance for the development of grasping mechanisms. the devices will be fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques. this project will be done in collaboration with the openbionics initiative and will result in the creation of an open-source repository for the new dexterity lab robot hand designs. 2. robust grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation with adaptive hands description: this project will focus on the formulation of hybrid methodologies that combine analytical methods, constrained optimization schemes and machine learning techniques to facilitate the execution of robust grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks with adaptive robot hands. the project will take advantage of the robotic devices developed in the new dexterity lab (outcomes of project #1). 3. blind robot grasping and haptic object identification with adaptive hands description: this project will focus on blind grasping and haptic object identification with adaptive hands. these goals will be achieved by formulating hybrid schemes that will leverage the benefits of simple, adaptive robot grippers (that can grasp successfully without prior knowledge of the hand or the object model), with simple sensors and advanced machine learning techniques. the applications of this project will be in the fields of industrial and warehouse automation, object quality and environment inspection. this project will take advantage of the robotic devices developed in the new dexterity lab (outcomes of project #1). 4. development of affordable, adaptive, personalized exo-suits and wearable robotic devices. description: this project will focus on the development of affordable, light-weight, adaptive, personalized exo-suits and human augmentation devices (e.g., exoskeletons, bionic gloves, wearable interfaces etc.), that will assist people in everyday life tasks, augmenting their capabilities. the particular devices may facilitate interaction not only with the physical world surrounding us, but also with various electronic devices and/or virtual environments. this project will be done in collaboration with the openbionics initiative. 5. development of novel brain machine interfaces for human-robot interaction, prosthetics and rehabilitation robotics description: this project will focus on the development of novel brain machine interfaces for the control of robotic and bionic devices. the interfaces will take advantage of a combination of sensors and signals, will employ state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies and shared control schemes and they will provide robust, intuitive and minimal effort control to the user. the brain machine interfaces that will be developed in this project will be used for the control of the robotic and bionic devices of the new dexterity lab (outcomes of projects #1 and #4). 6. assessment and evaluation of the anthropomorphism and dexterity of robotic and bionic devices description: over the last decades, a lot of researchers have characterized their robots as dexterous and/or anthropomorphic without really assessing their level of dexterity and human-likeness and without comparing them with similar devices. this project will focus on the assessment and evaluation of the different aspects of anthropomorphism and dexterity of robotic and bionic devices (e.g., appearance, kinematics, compliance, force exertion capability etc.), extracting metrics for design optimization. the design optimization part will focus on the prosthetic and bionic devices of the new dexterity lab (outcomes of projects #1 and #4). 7. analysis and evaluation of the human hand dexterity and grasping capabilities description: the human hand, nature's most versatile and dexterous end-effector has sensory and motor capabilities that endow it with unique properties and a degree of specialization that is not evident in other human body parts. the greek philosophers anaxagoras (~500 - 428 bc) and aristotle (384 - 322 bc) debated in their works, whether the dexterity of human hand helped humans develop a superior brain or the superior brain increased human hand dexterity. the mechanical dexterity of human hand is nowadays recognized, as the major factor that facilitated the development of a superior brain by the homo sapiens. this project will focus on the analysis of the human hand dexterity and on the evaluation of the human hand grasping capabilities. we will investigate the organization of the grasping and manipulation strategies that the humans employ for the execution of everyday life tasks, in order to better understand what makes the human hand so efficient and to provide specifications for the design of new robotic hands and novel grasping and manipulation algorithms. the university of auckland, nz the university of auckland is new zealand's pre-eminent research-led university, based in the centre of the
