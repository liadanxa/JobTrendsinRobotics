0,2005,"post-doc position available at inria rhone-alpes, grenoble (fr) - autonomous navigation in dynamic environments","----------------------
     post-doctoral proposal
     ----------------------

the inria e-motion research project-team at inria rhone-alpes is opening a
post-doctoral position in the field of:

       autonomous navigation in dynamic environments.



o subject description:

mobivip is a french research project whose purpose is to study, evaluate
and experiment technologies revolving around novel forms of transportation
systems based on ""public individual vehicles"" (see
http://www-sop.inria.fr/mobivip for more details).  public individual
vehicles are similar to their european counterparts, the cybercars (see
http://www.cybercars.org).

in this framework, the e-motion group of inria rhone-alpes addresses the
problem of automated driving in open and dynamic environments. an
environment is dynamic when it features moving objects and it is open when
full knowledge about it is not available beforehand (which is typically the
case of most real environments, in particular roadway-like environments).

the inria e-motion research project-team (formerly known as sharp) has a
long history in the field of motion autonomy.  it has been involved in a
number of french, european and international programmes and has
demonstrated in various occasions different autonomous driving skills with
real vehicles (parking, platooning, obstacle avoidance).  e-motion has
developed a number of techniques in fields as different as perception,
localisation, map building, motion planning, sensory-motor coupling and
reactive motion execution.

e-motion is currently exploring a motion planning scheme called ""partial
motion planning"" (pmp) whose purpose is to explicitly deal with the
constraints imposed by a dynamic environment, in particular the real-time
constraint imposed by the dynamicity of the environment: the motion planner
has a limited-time only to compute a motion.

given the intrinsic complexity of motion planning, fulfilling such a
real-time constraint is in general impossible to guarantee (even with the
most efficient randomised motion planners existing today).  one way to cope
cope with this issue is to compute a partial motion only, ie the best
partial motion given the time available.  in a way, pmp can be seen as a
compromise between pure motion planning and reactive approaches.

pmp, like reactive approaches, raises a safety issue: what guarantee do we
have that the robotic system will never find itself in a dangerous
situation yielding a collision in the future (this issue is critical in
dynamic environments).

to solve this problem, we believe that the concept of ""inevitable collision
states"" (ics) can be useful.  an ics is a state such that no matter what
the future trajectory of a robotic system is, it eventually collides with
an obstacles.  this concept is general and permits to take into account the
dynamics of both the robotic system and the moving objects.  clearly, for
its own safety, a robotic system should never be in one of these ics.

a first version of the pmp algorithm has been developed and implemented on
the experimental vehicle of the inria research unit located near paris (phd
of stephane petti).  the primary purpose of this post-doc position is to
integrate this algorithm onto the experimental vehicle of inria rhone-alpes
and then to further the work on pmp and ics so as to demonstrate the
validity of the overall concept on a real car-like vehicle.


o requirements (educational and technical background, knowledge of
  specific material):

  the experimental component of this post-doc will be significant.  it will
  involve a lot of development on the e-motion experimental platform, a
  cycab vehicle.  candidates should be motivated and definitely have a
  taste for this kind of work. former experience in real-time programming
  and control theory is a plus.

  mobivip being a french programme, fluency in french is very much welcomed
  (although not technically required).


o starting date: as early as possible (december 2005 would be great).


o duration: one year.


o wages: approximately 1800 euros per month, including standard health
   coverage.

description

the successful candidate will be required to implement and  validate 
algorithms which lead to autonomous navigation of a mobile  robot in an 
urban environment using an onboard monocular vision sensor.  initially, 
the navigation environment will be regarded as free of any other moving 
objects with only the vehicle to be controlled.

the work proposed is in the continuity of anthony remazeilles 
(http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/anthony.remazeilles-eng.html) phd 
thesis. the approach consists in using a database of images acquired 
during a preliminary learning step. the navigation involves jointly 
using the database and the current image acquired by the camera for 
determining the movement of the vehicle using qualitative visual 
servoing control laws.

a postdoctoral fellow is currently generalizing the approach, to deal 
with a non holonomic vehicle and an urban environment. the candidate 
will continue this work, in order to obtain robust and real-time 
algorithms for:
- the tracking of a set of points of interest along the image sequence 
acquired  by the camera,
- the matching of these points of interest with respect to the image 
database,
- the control law of the mobile robot using visual servoing techniques.

the implementation of the work will be integrated, tested and validated 
on the cycab vehicle

international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

9,2006,"postdoc position: laas/cnrs, france, advanced temporal models for autonomous robots","laas/cnrs is opening a postdoc position on the following subject.

advanced temporal models for autonomous robots

description:
currently, most autonomous systems, such as autonomous exploration  
rovers, integrate complex sensing and acting functionalities,  
controlled by complex deliberation mechanism (e.g. planning and  
execution control). nevertheless, this integration currently follows  
simple rules of thumb which do not rely on any clear v&v approach.   
at the functional level, a worst case empirical analysis is made and  
the developer tunes delays, priorities and cycles duration based on  
this analysis and the host machine. at the decisional level, some  
more formal methods are used (e.g. logical or constraint programming)  
and offer some temporal representation and reasoning (during  
deliberation but also execution).

moreover, the autonomy requirement of these systems keeps rising, and  
they need a more flexible approach to handle the resources used (in  
particular the cpu). thus it seems rather interesting to have a finer  
execution control model of the various functional components, based  
on their temporal interactions and relationships. such a model could  
then be used to guarantee that some temporal constraints remain  
valid, but also to better control the execution of the various  
modules while keeping the model valid. similarly, at the decisional  
level, the study of timed automata approaches could cast a new light  
on the planning and execution control problem.

the candidate will  focus his research on the following areas:

- study of existing autonomous systems
- timed automata as an unified model
- controller synthesis and  scheduling
- runtime verification and monitoring

the goal of the project is to improve the v&v aspect of current  
autonomous systems, in particular with respect to time.

this study is conducted in the framework of an anr project (amaes,  
advanced methods for autonomous embedded systems) which is jointly  
conducted by verimag, laas and liafa. part of the study will be  
implemented,  tested and demonstrated on a software  testbed.

requirements: there is no specific requirement, except having a phd   
in a related field (ai, robotics, v&v, timed systems, etc). the  
applicant should have some programming skills.

starting date: september/october 2006

duration: two year

image segmentation and modeling soft tissue deformation

this thesis will take place in the asclepios team at inria
sophia-antipolis in france within the framework of the european 
marie-curie research and training network entitled “3d anatomical human”.


description :
==============

the objective of this research and training network is to increase the
development of technologies and knowledge around virtual representations
of human body for interactive medical applications.
the network has a specific goal: developing realistic functional 3d
models for the human musculoskeletal system, the methodology being
demonstrated on the lower limb. partners of this network include the
epfl (switzerland), university of geneva (switzerland), crs4 in pula
(italy), aalborg university (danemark), ucl (uk), vrije universiteit
brussel (belgium).

the objectives of the proposed thesis are twofold. first, it consists in
segmenting anatomical structures of the lower limb (muscles, bones,
ligaments) from static and dynamic mr images. because of the variability
of those structures, the segmentation will be performed by combining
non-rigid image registration with segmentation based on deformable models.

in a second stage, the research activity will consist in developing
efficient soft tissue and muscle models that can be validated on
rheological datasets. those models should be based on continuum
mechanics and the finite element method and a procedure of estimating
mechanical parameters from rheological experiments should be developed
within the scope of the thesis.

the thesis will include training periods at some sites of the european
partners cited above.


requirements :
===============

the candidate should have a background in mathematics, mechanics or
computer science. good programming (preferably with c++) and
mathematical skills are essential. experience with numerical analysis,
modelling, medical image analysis, muscle physiology or image processing
would be an advantage. english written and spoken is necessary.

criteria on nationality, age and qualification apply. the candidate must
preferably be citizen of the european union but must not be a french
citizen or should not have spend more than 12 months in france for the
last 3 years.

we strongly encourage the application of women candidates.

** subject

numerical models of human walking as well as numerical methods of
optimal control are now reaching enough maturity [1, 2, 3, 4] for
considering seriously the development of fully functional predictive
models of normal and pathologic walking gaits that could become in
the near future powerful tools in therapies of gait disorders [4].
the purpose of such a model would be to help predicting the outcome
of a given medical act on the gait disorder of a person and therefore
help the medical staff deciding which medical act should be
preferred. a driving problem for this thesis could be for example the
surgical treatment of spasticity disorders in young children. such a
treatment regularly consists in modifying the kinematics of the
musculoskeletal system by applying surgery to the muscles, tendons
and bones of the person so as to relieve the disorders induced by the
spasticity. the predictive model we're looking for would help
deciding which surgery to apply and how.

the first step in developing such a predictive model would be to
decide of the underlying musculoskeletal model to consider, and
especially of the muscle contraction model [5] that could cope
properly with spasticity disorders. this physiological model will
form the basis of the predictive model itself and will need to be
balanced therefore between completeness and complexity. the second
and major step is to define the functional model of walking, that is
to effectively predict how a given physiological model will walk. the
building block here will most probably be optimal control [2]: we
suppose that walking amounts in one way or another to minimizing some
measure of discomfort and fatigue. the question then is to find which
optimal control problem can adequately predict the walking gaits
which are observed on a given set of patients.

there will be a major need here for a general identification
procedure to tune the model to each patient: knowing how a person
walks, with measures coming for example from traditional motion
capture methods and electromyography, tuning the different lengths
and coefficients of the physiological model, but most of all tuning
the different parameters of the functional model (the optimal control
problem) so as to obtain a ""prediction"", a numerical ""explanation"" of
why this person walks the way he or she walks. this problem of
parameter identification will mostly induce a problem of inverse
optimal control: find which optimal control problem gives as a
solution the gait that we can observe for a given person. this is
both a theoretical and a numerical problem.

once this tuned predictive model is obtained, the final goal will be
to apply it to the medical problem presented earlier, that is to
check the outcome of different surgical acts on this numerical model
of the person's gait, propose the results of these simulations to the
medical staff and validate their appropriateness.

microrobots.

the post doc will take charge of the microfabrication in clean room and 
will use the microfabrication facilities available in femto-st.
the candidate must be ph.d graduated and have an experience in clean 
room microfabrication. a good knowledge in the design of mechanical 
structures and in microsystems is required.

interested candidates should submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of the

20,2008,post-doc offer at inria tao in learning algorithms for collective robotic experiments,"tao team is hiring a *post-doc* and/or a *phd student* to work in learning
algorithms for collective robotic experiments.

*context*
the symbrion project <http://www.symbrion.eu/> is a european *integrated
project* that aims to build self-addembling robotic organisms from
autonomous individual small robots.
within symbrion, the tao team will investigate learning mechanisms in a
multi-scale perspective, distinguishing adaptive learning (life-time
learning, or on-line learning) and optimization (at an evolutionary
time-scale).

*tasks*
the task will be to design and implement machine learning algorithms under
limited resources on the hybrid paltform (software and hardware) provided by
the project partners. the stress will be put on dealing with huge robotic
logs and learning to construct efficient controller modules.
a first task will consist in applying some learning and/or data mining
techniques to multiple robot logs, while the robots are driven either by a
human being or by a manually written controller. this should allow to
automatically generate controller modules — off-line.
a second task will then be to design a high-level controller to perform the
action selection among different modules, either hard-coded or automatically
designed by the off-line procedure. this controller will be optimized either
off-line using evolutionary computation, or on-line using some algorithms
inspired from the multi-armed bandit techniques.

the ultimate goal of the project is to design on-line protocols to allow
open-ended evolution at both scales of high-level controller and generation
of new low-level modules.

*expertise*
knowledge in machine learning and statistics is of course mandatory, as well
as excellent programming skills (c++ and java). previous experience in
robotics and/or evolutionary computation is welcome.

*practical information*
the tao team is part of inria cri orsay île-de-france and its offices are in

are what they are, but include medical coverage.

21,2008,phd position - high-speed vision-based control - deadline 14/07/08,"phd position:

dynamic control of parallel kinematic manipulators using high-speed vision


1 context and motivation

this position is open within the robotics and autonomous complex systems 
group (rosace), interested in the control of robotic systems. this group 
is part of the ""laboratoire des sciences et matériaux pour 
l’electronique et d’automatique"" (lasmea) in clermont-ferrand, france. 
the scholarship is funded through the french research agency's (anr) 
”young researcher” project virago dealing with the vision-based control 
(or visual servoing) of parallel kinematic manipulators.

parallel kinematic manipulators, as opposed to serial kinematic 
manipulators, are composed of a mobile platform linked to its base by 
several kinematic chains. they thus allow for greater speed 
manipulation, higher loads and higher repeatability than serial 
kinematic manipulators. however, their control is made harder since one 
has to take into account the closure of the various kinematic chains. a 
way to by-pass much of the associated control difficulties is to perform 
eye-to-hand based visual servoing since it alleviates the problem of 
solving the theoretically hard forward kinematic problem. nevertheless, 
classic visual servoing is essentially a kinematic control scheme that 
assumes sufficiently low speeds to neglect the dynamic eﬀects due to 
inertia or coriolis forces. this is not realistic in the case of 
parallel kinematic manipulators designed for high-speed.

therefore, we have been developing a formal framework for high-speed 
vision-based computed torque control, where vision copes with the high 
control frequencies and the control laws with the rigid body dynamics. 
the approach has been validated on the orthoglide prototype in nantes and
accelerations of 1g were reached. the phd candidate will have to extend 
this framework to take into account ﬂexibilities that can not be avoided 
at really high speed. in particular, the experimental validation will 
take place on the new adept quattro robot which reaches 20g accelerations.

2 prerequisites

• good mathematical background
• good mechanical engineering background (multi-body dynamics, robot
control)
• basic knowledge in computer vision
• programing skills
• preferably ﬂuent french but ﬂuent english can be accepted

title: obstacle avoidance algorithm in dynamic environment

general background
this subject takes place in the context of researches drives on mobile robots
navigation under uncertainty in the frame of tims (technology and information
support systems for mobility and safety) research federation in
clermont-ferrand, france. more particularly, the thesis position will take
place between lasmea (research theme rosace ) and cemagref (research theme most
) and will aim at increasing the autonomy of unmanned vehicle with respect to
uncertainty linked to the robots environment, thanks to the development of
algorithms enabling dynamic obstacles avoidance. numerous works have indeed
been completed in this research context, in particular related to mobile robot
localization and control with uncertain dynamics, but neglecting yet the
interaction with obstacles. the algorithm to be developed will then take
benefit of the algorithms already available and is expected to be based on a
global approach including:

* the mobile robot localization in a known environment. related to the previous
and on going works, several techniques can be used with respect to the vehicle
state. using absolute and known 3d maps, or based on a previous learning and
updating map, these various approached are based on several and various sensors
and often attached to a control approach.
* obstacle detection, description and tracking. this detection has to be focused
on motionless obstacle (building, sidewalk, trees, hole) and dynamic one as well
(such as pedestrian, animals). the detection has then to account for obstacle
motion and dimensions, but also the capability of mobile robots with respect to
its estimated state issued from the monitoring.
* monitoring of the vehicle state and its interaction with environment. the
navigation under uncertain dynamics (in particular in an off-road context)
requires the estimation and reconstruction of both the interaction behaviour
between vehicle and its environment (such as adherence, perturbations,
stability) but also the internal robot operation (such as fault detection).
* reference path and corridor generation based on known map. the motion control
of mobile robots requires in an assumed to be known environment requires the
knowledge of a nominal path to be followed including margin (corridor) pending
on environment and robot capability.
* navigation strategy and control of vehicle motion for obstacle avoidance.
several control strategies are available for obstacle avoidance accounting for
the robot motion control, the efficiency of which depends on the environment
context and robot state. the selection of an appropriate strategy with respect
to the estimated robot configuration and respecting the navigation goal (path
tracking, velocity preservation) is a key issue of this subject.

work objectives and methodology
the proposed thesis will contribute to the design of a navigation system
dedicated to mobile robots subject to uncertain dynamics. several strategies
for obstacle avoidance will then be proposed pending on the robot
configuration, state and its interaction with the environment. based on works
related to the localization, motion control and detection already in
development. more particularly, the work will be focused on the modelling of
robot interaction with its environment and potential obstacle allowing to
derive a dynamic obstacle definition. coupled with the motion control, several
techniques (such as path deformation or potential field) will be studied,
improved and evaluated to allow the robot navigation ensuring its integrity.
the interaction with trajectory tracking control laws will also be study to
preserve motion accuracy with respect to a desired path, preliminary defined.

theoretical developments will be tested in full scale experiments thanks to the
experimental platforms available in the research federation. the electrical
autonomous mobile robots aroco (for natural environment) and cycab (dedicated
to urban environment) equipped with numerous exteroceptive and proprioceptive
sensor will be more particularly used to show the capabilities of proposed
algorithm.

knowledge of a nominal path to be followed including margin (corridor) pending
on environment and robot capability.
* navigation strategy and control of vehicle motion for obstacle avoidance.
several control strategies are available for obstacle avoidance accounting for
the robot motion control, the efficiency of which depends on the environment
context and robot state. the selection of an appropriate strategy with respect
to the estimated robot configuration and respecting the navigation goal (path
tracking, velocity preservation) is a key issue of this subject.

work objectives and methodology
the proposed thesis will contribute to the design of a navigation system
dedicated to mobile robots subject to uncertain dynamics. several strategies
for obstacle avoidance will then be proposed pending on the robot
configuration, state and its interaction with the environment. based on works
related to the localization, motion control and detection already in
development. more particularly, the work will be focused on the modelling of
robot interaction with its environment and potential obstacle allowing to
derive a dynamic obstacle definition. coupled with the motion control, several
techniques (such as path deformation or potential field) will be studied,
improved and evaluated to allow the robot navigation ensuring its integrity.
the interaction with trajectory tracking control laws will also be study to
preserve motion accuracy with respect to a desired path, preliminary defined.

theoretical developments will be tested in full scale experiments thanks to the
experimental platforms available in the research federation. the electrical
autonomous mobile robots aroco (for natural environment) and cycab (dedicated
to urban environment) equipped with numerous exteroceptive and proprioceptive
sensor will be more particularly used to show the capabilities of proposed
algorithm.

is available immediatly in the area of medical robotics. scientific  
description of the research activities are detailed below and  
contacts are given

title

instrument-organ interaction modeling for physiological motion  
compensation using force and us-image measurements.

location

the montpellier laboratory of informatics, robotics, and

address: laboratoire lirmm, département de robotique

   161 rue ada 34392 - montpellier - france


project description

the position is available within the national framework « uscomp »  
founded by the anr (french research agency) in 2008.

in this research project, we want to provide methods and solutions to  
perform real time motion compensation of organs using ultra-sound  
(us) images.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the us-probe position  
with respect to the physiological motion of the observed patient  
structure. this allows the surgeon to work on stabilized image and to  
perform thus a surgery of quality.

to do so, the us-probe (a 2d or 3d probe) will be held by a vision- 
force controlled surgical robot. to enhance the performance and the  
robustness of the system, we propose to use in the controller loop a  
model of the interaction between the us-probe and the patient skin.  
since this interaction model is patient specific, it must be  
estimated in-line based on the measurements given by the force sensor  
and the us-probe.

the main goals of this work are:

·      to model the interaction between the us-probe and the patient  
soft tissues (superficial and underling layers)
·      to propose a patient specific protocol to estimate in-line the  
parameters of the model
·      to identify the relationship between the applied forces and  
the tissues deformation
·      to use the calculated model to control the contact interaction  
between the us-probe and the patient skin
·      to implement the model in a predictive force controller: this  
allows maintaining the contact between the probe and the patient skin  
and offers to the surgeon stable and good quality us-image despite  
the physiological motion of the organs
·      coupling the force measurement and the us-image information  
within a hybrid vision/force controller. here, the control and the  
coupling strategies are to be defined (hybrid approach, data fusion,  
dynamic projector, …)

requirements

candidates with excellent background in biomechanics and/or living  
tissue modeling and/or medical robotics are encouraged to apply. c++  
programming is also requested. qualifications include ph.d., m.d.- 
ph.d., or equivalent doctoral degree. french language is not required.


starting date / duration / salary


the position will be available at the earliest convenience for a  
maximum 18 months duration. the salary will be around 2200€ per month.

starting date: september 1, 2009 or october 1, 2009

duration: 20 months

monthly salary: 2357 euros (1923 euros free of tax)

context:

this post-doctoral position is part of the research project anr contint 
uscomp funded by the french national research agency (anr).
this project involves a collaboration with the visages project-team in 
rennes, lsiit in strasbourg and lirmm in montpellier.
its goal is to provide methodological solutions allowing real-time 
compensation of the motion of living soft tissues during ultrasound 
imaging.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the displacement of a 2d 
or 3d ultrasound sensor in such a way to stabilize the observed
image thanks to a robotized probe holder.
this project deals with the complete signal process of the system, 
including perception of the environment and robot control.
the problematic concerns more specially the use in the control scheme of 
the per-operative ultrasound image,
the interaction force between the probe and the soft tissues and the 
measurements of external signals providing the breathing state of the 
patient.

mission:

the main goal of this postdoc is to propose new visual servoing 
techniques based on ultrasound images to automatically synchronize
the displacement of a robotized ultrasound probe with the soft tissue 
motion.

activities of the postdoc are:

- to determine the visual features that can be extracted from live 
segmented ultrasound images
and that are pertinent to perform the robotic task of soft tissue motion 
stabilization.

- to model the interaction that links the variation of the retained 
visual features to the probe displacements.

- to design a kinematic control law using the developed interaction 
model in order to move the robot holding the probe
in such a way to automatically follow a soft tissue element of interest.

- to implement the proposed methods and the developments performed by 
the lirmm and lsiit partners related to the control part of the robotic 
system.
these developments respectively concern the force control of the 
robotized probe and the extension of the control with a predictive 
control scheme
using the measurement of physiological signals of the patient for fast 
motion compensation capability.

the developed methods will be tested and validated on an experimental 
setup made up of an ultrasound probe mounted
on a six degrees of freedom “hyppocrate” medical robot. in first 
experiments a six-axis “adept viper” robot will also be used to apply
simulated physiological motion to ultrasound phantom in order to 
simulate soft tissue motion.
if first results are convincing, experiments on human will be performed 
using the “hyppocrate” safe medical robot.

requirements:

- competences in robotics and in computer vision are strongly required.
- competences in visual servoing, control and image processing are 
highly recommended.
- an excellent practice in c++ programming is also required.

applications:

applications must include a letter of candidature, a brief vitae, a 
publication list and a letter of recommendation.
applications have to be sent by e-mail to alexandre.krupa at irisa.fr

35,2009,"phd position urgent - multi-view slam for the control of space robots - cnrs-i3s, sophia antipolis, france","the computer vision and robotics group at the cnrs-i3s, 
sophia-antipolis, france is seeking an outstanding phd candidate for a 
cnrs funded scholarship. candidates are asked to apply rapidly as the 
project should begin in october 2009.

the position is under the supervision of dr. andrew comport and 
professor tarek hamel and is associated with a project developing new 
techniques in real-time simultaneous localisation and mapping (slam) 
using multi-view computer vision. this project will focus on applying 
these techniques to space exploration in collaboration with thales 
alenia space. this will involve the study of autonomous navigation of 
space robots in unknown environments and safe landing.

the primary part of this study concerns developing a visual perception 
system that localises the spacecraft with respect to reference bodies 
and performs visual servoing to achieve environment mapping and safe 
landing. the interest here will be to use the theory of multi-view 
differential geometry to perform closed-loop visual servoing control. it 
will be necessary to develop an analytic relationship between the 
movement of the space vehicle and the movement of external bodies such 
as asteroids and planets perceived by the visual sensors. this will also 
include identifying pertinent control parameters that adhere to a 
rigorous set of criterion (robustness, stability, precision, efficiency) 
along with the choice of technical constraints such as the optimal 
placement of the cameras. in particular, it will be of interest to 
develop a global task function which allows the aircraft to behave 
correctly in accordance with the online dynamics (for example, the 
movement of an asteroid), changing illumination conditions (according to 
the luminosity and the visibility), perturbations (such as varying 
temperatures) or large differences in perceived scale of the environment.

the second part will involve developing algorithms for mapping the 
environment both in an off-line learning phase and an online update 
phase. the former case will allow to reduce the computational complexity 
of the online problem by performing the bulk of the computational effort 
off-line. this will involve creation of a navigational framework that 
allows the creation of image-based maps within which a robot is to 
execute a global task. given a set of training measurements, task 
planning consists in constructing optimal representations of these maps 
in such a way that localisation and control of the aircraft may be 
perform precisely whilst remaining invariant to dynamic changes in the 
environment. the online map will be updated and integrated into the 
control objective when new and better quality measurements become 
available such as during a landing phase where higher resolution images 
are available closer to the ground.

the candidates for the phd position are expected to have an engineering 
msc degree (ee, cs or physics/maths). strong programming skills in c, 
c++, matlab or equivalent are required and experience in computer vision 
and robotics is desirable. applicants demonstrating excellence in other 
related areas are encouraged to apply. international applications are 
encouraged and will receive logistic support with visa issues. the 
salary is 1757 euro/month gross and will be indexed with inflation.

research group: lagadic http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html

address: inria rennes - bretagne atlantique - campus universitaire de 
beaulieu - 35042 rennes - france

starting date: at your earliest convenience

duration: 20 months

monthly salary: 2357 euros (1923 euros free of tax)

description of the post-doc position is also available at 
http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/documents/position/2009-postdoc-uscomp.html

context:

this post-doctoral position is part of the research project anr contint 
uscomp funded by the french national research agency (anr).
this project involves a collaboration with the visages project-team in 
rennes, lsiit in strasbourg and lirmm in montpellier.
its goal is to provide methodological solutions allowing real-time 
compensation of the motion of living soft tissues during ultrasound 
imaging.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the displacement of a 2d 
or 3d ultrasound sensor in such a way to stabilize the observed
image thanks to a robotized probe holder.
this project deals with the complete signal process of the system, 
including perception of the environment and robot control.
the problematic concerns more specially the use in the control scheme of 
the per-operative ultrasound image,
the interaction force between the probe and the soft tissues and the 
measurements of external signals providing the breathing state of the 
patient.

mission:

the main goal of this postdoc is to propose new visual servoing 
techniques based on ultrasound images to automatically synchronize
the displacement of a robotized ultrasound probe with the soft tissue 
motion.

activities of the postdoc are:

- to determine the visual features that can be extracted from live 
segmented ultrasound images
and that are pertinent to perform the robotic task of soft tissue motion 
stabilization.

- to model the interaction that links the variation of the retained 
visual features to the probe displacements.

- to design a kinematic control law using the developed interaction 
model in order to move the robot holding the probe
in such a way to automatically follow a soft tissue element of interest.

- to implement the proposed methods and the developments performed by 
the lirmm and lsiit partners related to the control part of the robotic 
system.
these developments respectively concern the force control of the 
robotized probe and the extension of the control with a predictive 
control scheme
using the measurement of physiological signals of the patient for fast 
motion compensation capability.

the developed methods will be tested and validated on an experimental 
setup made up of an ultrasound probe mounted
on a six degrees of freedom “hyppocrate” medical robot. in first 
experiments a six-axis “adept viper” robot will also be used to apply
simulated physiological motion to ultrasound phantom in order to 
simulate soft tissue motion.
if first results are convincing, experiments on human will be performed 
using the “hyppocrate” safe medical robot.

requirements:

- competences in robotics and in computer vision are strongly required.
- competences in visual servoing, control and image processing are 
highly recommended.
- an excellent practice in c++ programming is also required.

applications:

applications must include a letter of candidature, a brief vitae, a 
publication list and a letter of recommendation.
applications have to be sent by e-mail to alexandre.krupa at irisa.fr

marie curie (upmc)–paris 6 (http://www.upmc.fr/) under prof. edwige
pissaloux supervision (edwige.pissaloux at upmc.fr)


the position will be founded within the frame of a fp7 ict european project.

thesis title is “detection and tracking of 3d scene features”.

thesis summary.

 the isir (institute of intelligent systems & robotics) (former
laboratoire de robotique de paris) of the upmc (university pierre and
marie curie, former paris 6 university), through various national,
european and international research projects, studies neuro-cognitive
human-space interaction in order to design and realize prototypes of
intelligent systems, robotics and mechatronics systems, highly autonomous
and/or able to assist healthy and handicapped in performing everyday life
tasks.
 the ability to interact with the environment, and especially to move in
it, is a key element for human and robot autonomy. the autonomous
navigation seems to be mainly supported by vision and balance which,
conveniently combined, allow the elaboratation of adequate motor stimulis
for the interaction progressing.
the precise process of human vision and balance data combination when
navigating is unknown; however it is hypothesized that the vision detectes
& helps to memorizes 3d scene (not only geometric) features, while balance
selects pertinent features and tracks them in image sequence.

this thesis aims to design and prototype a system - a new nomad
eye-tracker- which detects and tracks image geometric and cognitive
features of a 3d scene when navigating, ie. which determines the gaze
direction of subject carrying the system at any time. new hardware system
will be designed and prototyped with commercially available components.
the dedicated software will encompass new and spatio-temporal optimized
algorithms for feature detection and tracking and for vision & inertial
data combination; both classes of the algorithms could be bases upon
present knowledge of neuro-cognitive sciences for which a new
computational models will be designed.
a new nomad eye-tracker will be validated through real applications which
aim to assist the interactions of arm and hand motor handicapped people in
execution of everyday tasks. finally the designed system (simulating
partly the human head) will be integrated in the asterics system.


key words: feature and gaze detection and tracking in images and 3d
scenes, visual perception, inertial data, vision and inertial data
combination, particle filter, assistance of the control of the environment

47,2010,"engineer / post-doc position at ensta-paristech ""embedded vision on parallel computing platform""","the electronics and computer science laboratory of ensta-paristech 
(http://www.ensta.fr), carrying out academic and industrial research in 
robotics and vision, offers an engineer / post-doctoral position to 
develop, characterize and optimize vision applications on off-the-shelf 
parallel computing platform.

instances of such platform range from gpu (e.g. nvidia fermi) to low 
power multimedia circuit embedded in cell phones (e.g. ti omap). they 
use dedicated development environments and operating systems, that will 
need specific learning efforts, possibly including some hardware aspects.

applications will be related to mobile robotics or video surveillance. 
more specifically, object characterization and recognition, or visual 
cartography and navigation for autonomous vehicle will be considered. 
parallel computing will naturally be used to accelerate the most 
intensive tasks, such as feature extraction (e.g. salient points), or 
the implementation of machine learning techniques. a key issue will be 
to manage irregularity in data processing.

algorithmic choices, in particular those dealing with the target 
application or the adequation with the chosen architecture, will be made 
in collaboration with one or more faculty members, and the resulting 
works are vowed to be published.

neuromuscular modeling for joint torque - position - stiffness control 
using co-contraction strategies and biosignals feedback

location:
  demar project
  lirmm-inria sophia antipolis
  montpellier, france

starting date:
  september 2010
  
environnement
demar research interests are centered on the human sensory motor system, 
including muscles, sensory feedbacks, and neural motor networks.
the main scientific axes of demar are then:
- modelling the sensory motor system, since designing efficient control 
schemes and performing realistic simulations need for modelling. the 
scientific approach is to develop multi scale models based on the 
physiological microscopic reality up to a macroscopic behavior of the 
main parts of the sensori motor system : muscles, natural sensors and 
neural structures.
- controlling the sensory motor system through the fes technique. 
advanced control strategy such as high order sliding modes, nonlinear 
model predictive control, high level hybrid approaches based on 
continuous control and event triggered commutation of strategies, 
movement trajectory generation, etc. are studied.
- interfacing artificial and natural parts through neuroprosthetic 
devices.
 
missions
the applicant will have to model the ankle joint includings tibialis 
anterior soleus and gastrocnemius muscles with the advnaced model we 
proposed. then the applicant will be asked to:
- theoretically analyse the model (sensitivity of the parameters, force-
position-stiffness controllability depending on the context of use)
- propose adapted model to the problem
- propose control strategies
- propose experimental validations protocol on paraplegics / healthy 
subjects
 
activites will be theoretical such as model design, control scheme 
analysis (stability, performance, commandability), but also software 
developments (matlab-scilab and middleware for modeling, real time 
programming with stimulators and sensors acquisition). experimentations 
will be performed with healthy and spinal cord injured patients. 
 
complementary information
a msc degree is required in control eng. or related topics. software eng.
, scientific computing, model parameter identification are extra needed 
knowledge.
some experience with experimental validations (robots or fes) will be 
appreciated. great ability to work within a team in close collaborations 
with other members in clinical partners.

active compensation of pathological tremor using fes

environnement
tremor is defined as the involuntary rhythmic or semi rhythmic 
oscillation of a body part resulting from alternating of simultaneous 
contractions of antagonistic muscle groups. the tremor frequency may 
change but motion is always sinusoidal. tremor is the most common 
abnormal motion encountered in human pathology. it is classified 
depending on the source and can be a rest tremor or an action tremor 
(kinetic or postural). the origin, the functional consequences and the 
treatment may change depending on the pathology. pathological tremor 
affects 5-9% of the population age 40 and above. common causes of 
pathological tremor include parkinson’s disease or cerebellar 
dysfunctions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke, etc.). not only does this 
involuntary movement impair the activities of daily living of many 
patients, it also often leads to social embarrassment and even 
isolation. the lifetime economical and social cost as a result of a 
reduction in independence is an enormous burden to an individual, as 
well as the society.
the main objective of the project is then to propose an alternate 
solution to actual pharmacological or surgical therapies that may have 
limited results. this alternate solution is based on the active tremor 
compensation of the upper limbs via functional electrical stimulation. 
the tremor project is composed of 4 subsections (two scientific, one 
technological and one clinical) which are successively i) modeling of 
pathological tremor, ii) synthesis of algorithms for active tremor 
compensation, iii) design of a prototype for a wearable orthosis and iv) 
clinical evaluation.
it involves a research laboratory (lirmm) through the research teams 
dexter and demar, a company (mxm) expert in functional electrical 
stimulation and two clinical partners (chu of montpellier, neurology 
department, and propara rehabilitation center).

missions
currently, tremor modelling and filtering algorithms have been developed 
to better understand the physiological phenomenon of tremor and to 
separate voluntary motion from disturbed motion subject to tremor. we 
are now in the phase of developing closed loop control algorithms and 
testing clinically all the proposed algorithms.

activities
within the duration of the post-doctoral position, the main goals to be 
achieved are then:
•to evaluate first the feasibility and efficiency of fes to reduce upper 
limb tremor in open loop. the outcome of this will be a set of 
strategies in terms of stimulated muscles and fes parameters adapted to 
given patient profiles.
•to implement new closed loop control algorithms for compensating tremor 
based on inertial sensors (e.g. accelerometers) and physiological 
sensors (e.g. emg),
•to evaluate clinically the filtering and control algorithms in closed 
loop on a large set of patients
all experiments have been submitted to the authorization of the ethical 
committee obtained in september 2009.

55,2010,"postdoc and phd positions in parallel robotics in montpellier, france","[apologies for multiple postings]

dear colleagues,

a 12-month postdoctoral position and a three year phd position in 
parallel robotics are available within the dexter project team of the 
lirmm robotics department in montpellier, france.

both the postdoctoral researcher and the phd student will be involved in 
the project cogiro, ""control of giant robots"", which deals with parallel 
cable-driven robots having very large workspaces and possibly heavy 
payloads. cogiro is a three-year project (2010-2012) funded by the 
french national research agency (anr). the partners of the project 
consist of three french research labs (lirmm, lasmea and inria sophia 
antipolis) and one company (fatronik france).

a parallel cable-driven robot consists mainly of a mobile platform, a 
set of winches and a number of cables connecting in parallel the 
platform to the winches. generally, the winches are fixed to the ground 
(or to walls, to a frame, ...) and each cable is attached to the mobile 
platform at one end. at its other end, the cable is wound by means of 
one of the winches. the control of the length of each cable allows the 
control of the position and orientation of the mobile platform. cable 
actuation enables the realization of robots having very large 
workspaces, potentially allowing the automation of tasks which can 
hardly be accomplished by conventional robots.

56,2010,postdoc position: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment,"development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera 
in soc environment

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.
in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.
the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.
in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

*title of post-doc: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for 
ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment*

* *

*description*

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.

in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.

the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.

in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

more details about the phd subject:

the first task will consist in designing a specific embedded system for 
the perception and tracking of local deformations in non-rigid objects. 
in this way, a structured light system coupled to a customsmart camera 
will be used. the main objective will be then to increase the 
flexibilities of the perception system by controlling the available dofs 
to improve  its accuracy and robustness. the perception capabilities of 
the system can be dynamically impacted by changing both its internal 
state (relative position between structured light and camera, focus ...) 
and its external state (spatial position of the whole system). for 
example, potential occlusion of the deformable surface can be avoided by 
positioning adequately the sensor apparatus. in addition, the camera 
systems or the processing accuracy can be managed (increased or 
decreased to manage the computational cost) by modifying the internal 
state of the perception system. sensor‐based control laws acting on the 
internal/external states of the perception system will be used to fit 
this goal."

more details about the phd subject:

curent visual simultaneous localisation an mapping (slam or vslam) 
algorithms have some shortcomings when they are applied to large scale 
environments. first the algorithmic complexity grows quadratically with 
the size of the map, and large scale maps are intractable. moreover, 
maps generated with slam or structure from motion (sfm) algorithms have 
some large scale drift coming from error accumulation.

however, in the case of mobile robot navigation, local maps are 
sufficient to allow autonomous navigation. large scale drift doesn't 
matter because the robot sensors can only see nearby landmarks. on the 
other hand, for tasks such as path planning, using the whole map is 
mandatory. the same is true for matching locations between the slam map 
and a geographical information system or an aerial image. in those 
cases, the map needs to be topologically correct. that means the 
transformation between the map and the real world should be bijective 
and bicontinuous. to achieve that, it is necessary to solve the well 
known problem of the loop closing.

the objective of this thesis will be to propose a slam system able to 
deal with the above mentioned difficulties. two main problems have to be 
adressed. first the representation of the map should be able to decouple 
the local geometry from large scale structure and topology. the map 
should be able to accept large scale deformations or loop closures with 
a low computational cost and without modifying the local geometry. the 
second problem to solve is the detection of loop closures. this can be 
done by combining 2d photometric information from images and 3d 
information from the local geometry."

rehabilitation 

project:
inria is the french national institute for research in computer science 
and control. the institute's strategy closely combines scientific 
excellence and technology transfer.
demar project's research interests are centered on the human sensory 
motor modeling, including muscles, sensory feedbacks, and neural motor 
networks. final goal of this team is oriented towards the development of 
advanced neuroprotheses to restore deficient functions.
http://www.lirmm.fr/demar/

research direction:
identification of biomechanical dynamics and muscle dynamics for 
neurologically damaged patient is already challenging as the system 
response can drastically vary depending on the degree of the patient 
deficiencies. in fes (functional electrical stimulation), movement 
synthesis and control are still a challenging task due to the complexity 
of whole body dynamics computation and the nonlinearity of stimulated 
muscle dynamics. one of the challenge concerns the feedback (torque, 
emg, joint angle) that can be used to control joint angle, torque or 
stiffness. moreover, control strategies have to be designed in order to 
be performed on portable architecture and tuned through advanced 
modeling and simulation.
in order to obtain stimulation patterns for a given movement 
corresponding to current patient posture condition, both off-line 
optimization for movement synthesis and online closed control are needed.
 in this context, the goal of this phd work is to study the 
optimization-based motion synthesis and real-time control framework 
which can generate stimulation patterns from the pre-computed motion 
synthesis database. motion capture system together with the estimation 
of the center of mass would be used to assess the strategies. this work 
aims at the development of automatic method to establish deficient limb 
stability in computer-aided rehabilitation.

************************************************************************
subject : modeling and control of reconfigurable parallel robots





context :

because of the heavy economic pressure, most of the companies are  
forced to quickly modify their means of production (manufacturing  
tools, machines, robots
) in order to ensure a high productivity, a  
high flexibility and to increase their production capacity. therefore,  
the principle of reconfigurable manufacturing system answers the needs  
of agility and productivity and permits to substantially extend the  
tool use so as to be suitable for the production of a great range of  
products.



according to this report, new machines, mechanisms and robots appear  
such as new parallel robots which are able to change their  
configuration or operating mode in order to increase their workspace  
and/or modify their kinematic structure. however, even if this kind of  
mechanisms could be used to increase the manufacturing system  
productivity and agility, new phenomena (parallel and serial  
singularities
) are introduced and locally reduce the robot  
controllability which affect the robot workspace and making the robot  
reconfiguration more difficult.



thesis objectives :

the main objective of the thesis is to develop a new control law  
(based on advanced modeling) dedicated to parallel robots  
reconfiguration. the algorithm would permit the parallel and serial  
singularities crossing for both increasing the robot workspace and  
allow the change of robot configuration without using additional  
actuators (no redundancy). therefore, it consists of using an optimal  
and/or variable modeling of the robot coupled with calibration  
algorithm, observers and advanced control laws (multi-model control  
algorithm
) so as to ensure the robot stability close to the robot  
singular position. as a consequence, the main goal is to increase the  
robot workspace and to ensure the robot stability (mechanical and  
automatic stabilities point of view) by managing on-line the robot  
reconfiguration/change of posture in function of the task to be done.



the technical objective consists of carrying out the parallel and  
serial singularities crossing on each actual robots located at ifma  
(french institute of advanced mechanic): the parallel robots 3crs[1]  
and 3rrr[2]. in the case of the 3crs robot, the aim is to reconfigure  
the robot so as to modify its kinematical structure from 3crs to 3prr  
in order to permit the realization of new tasks. in the case of the  
3rrr robot, the goal is to show how the theoretical developments are  
used to improve the robot workspace in order to decrease product cycle  
time.

scientific locks identified give the thesis a multidisciplinary aspect  
which transcend mechanic, automatic, computer science and electronic.

·         which mechanical modeling can be used for singularity crossing ?

·         how the quality of motion transmission close to a  
singularity point can be evaluated, which criterion is adapted ?

·         which control law is adapted to ensure the robot stability ?

·         how many observers have to be used for motion variables estimation?

·         how the trajectory is modified or influenced by the  
singularity crossing ?

·         how the robot reconfiguration is managed according to the task ?



the thesis originality is also characterized by the formulation of a  
new control law algorithm (based on an advanced modeling) experimented  
on actual robots and used to manage on-line the robot reconfiguration  
according to the task so as to increase the manufacturing tool agility.

88,2011,phd thesis proposal: towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics,"*phd thesis proposal*

towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics

*context*

high precision industries, such as semi-conductor industry, are in need 
of machines combining high accuracy and high throughput. to date this 
need has been covered mostly by standard equipment such as x-y tables; 
however this approach is now reaching its limits in terms of maximum 
speed and acceleration. on the other hand, robots have been designed for 
pick-and-place industries which can reach very impressive accelerations 
but none of them have demonstrated enough accuracy to satisfy the 
semi-conductor industry requirements.

indeed designers are facing two scientific and technological barriers: 
serial machines suffer from high inertias limiting their acceleration 
capability; parallel mechanisms suffer from poor stiffness limiting 
their accuracy.

this thesis aims at advancing those frontiers and will be developed in 
synergy between the etel company (switzerland) and lirmm (france).

*research approach*

at first the research work will be guided by generic needs coming from 
industrial applications. starting from this, innovative concepts of 
kinematics, actuation systems, measurement and control strategies should 
be searched for. modeling of various inaccuracy sources (joints, 
transmissions, vibrations, control, etc) should be carried out so that 
their impact on the global system can be clearly understood. in this 
research work, both mechanical design and control issues should be 
investigated. along the project, assessment of results and proof of 
concepts should be made by designing and operating prototypes.

*environment*

etel is the world's leading supplier for direct drive and motion systems 
with research, development and production facilities in môtiers, 
switzerland; lirmm is a joint laboratory of université montpellier 2 and 
cnrs, and is installed in montpellier, france. research will be mostly 
done in montpellier but frequent visits and stays in môtiers are 
foreseen. ph.d. dissertation shall be written in english to facilitate 
dissemination among etel employees.

academic adviser will be dr. françois pierrot

91,2011,phd position at inria sophia-antipolis : life long navigation and map learning,"title: life long navigation and map learning

subject: the objective of this phd, funded by astrium/eads, is to 
investigate
the general problem of visual mapping of complex 3d environments that evolve
over time. this requires explicitly taking into account the variability of
viewing conditions and content within a 3d geometric and photometric 
model of
the environment. a central objective will be to investigate how to 
efficiently
and accurately represent this model. the aim is to build models that remain
usable over long periods of time for navigation tasks (localisation and path
following) for autonomous systems or for people that require guidance. this
research problem, which is already active in the vision community, has only
just begun to be investigated by the robotics community via the new 
perspective
of incremental slam (simultaneous localization and mapping).

now that the problem of modelling large-scale environments is well 
understood,
the next major technical challenge on the horizon is the problem of 
being able
to maintain a valid environment representation over a long period of 
time. this
problem is referred to as life-long learning. this topic is in 
continuity with
the research carried out conjointly between p.rives from the arobas team at
inria sophia-méditerranée and a.comport from cnrs-i3s unsa

the implementation of the work will be integrated, tested and validated on
robotic platforms available at inria sophia-antipolis and partner 
laboratories.


requirements : for this position, candidates must be enrolled in a masters
stream with a focus on computer vision, visual servoing, and/or automatic
control. the candidate should have also good abilities for software 
development
and report writing.

title: robot behavior adaptation based on audio/visual perception for human-robot social interaction

short description:
the main goal of this work is to embody social and cognitive capabilities in a robot (nao robot and/or meka robot) so as
to create stimulating and engaging interactions. the successful candidate will work on developping a multi-modal
interaction process that aims to determine the user’s state as well as to produce the adequate response (e.g. empathy,
interest). this process will involve several channels: verbal, nonverbal, physiological, human and robot personalities.
hence, beyond traditional interaction technologies such as user localization, tracking, speech and gesture recognition,
the project investigates scientific methodologies for showing interest, paying attention, interpretation of intentions,
emotional states which are fundamental elements for initiating, maintaining and regulating interaction. verbal and non-
verbal communicative signals interpretation and attention mechanisms will be used to ensure a continuous interaction.

candidates:
interested candidates should have a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, and human-robot interaction.

offer for a post-doc position at inria (france) on navigation in dynamic and human-populated environments

title: 
------- 
navigation system in dynamic and human populated environments to improve the mobility of frail people. 

key words: 
--------------- 
robotics, navigation systems, perception, prediction, human aware navigation, assistance to frail people. 

summary: 
------------- 
this postdoc takes place in the scope of the inria large scale initiative action 
aen pal (personally assisted living http://pal.inria.fr/) which gathers the research activities 
of several inria research teams to improve the autonomy and the quality of life for the elderly 
and fragile persons. the action aims to create a research infrastructure that will offer 
technology solutions to improve the quality of life of frail people and their proximity circle. it 
focuses on the autonomy of the elderly in home health care by securing, preserving or 
restoring their functions necessary for everyday life. 

subject: 
---------- 
the objective of this postdoc is to develop navigation technologies adapted to the 
mobility assistance of aging or disabled people. the core of this work relies on 
complementary skills of arolag and e-motion inria projects concerning mapping, 
localization and safe navigation in dynamic and human populated environments. 
autonomous robotic systems are progressively moving from controlled laboratory 
environments towards real-world applications. state of the art approaches now endow robots 
with the ability to navigate within complex real-world environments by taking into account 
both the robot's surroundings and its position within the environment. additionally, the 
perceptual capabilities of these systems have recently been augmented through the use of realtime 
visual sensors that provide a very rich source of information [meilland10]. 
one of the major problems remains the capability to deal with large variations of the scene 
over time. 
a first objective will be to develop a novel approach to capture and characterize the 
information shared by different views of a dynamic and evolving environment registered 
under different conditions of observations. doing this, we expect to get a representation well 
adapted to autonomous navigation tasks and robust to the changes in the environment. 
relying on this representation, a second objective will be to develop navigation strategies that 
allow the robot to safely move in changing environment, with a socially acceptable behaviour. 
in the scope of the postdoc, we propose to integrate previous works developped both in 
arolag and e-motion research teams adressing the navigation decision process [fulgenz10], 
the spherical robot-centered representation of the environment described in [meilland11], 
abilities to predict the near future of this perceived environment [mvavasq 2007], and social 
conventions [irosrios 2011]. 
the core of the work will be focused on dynamic and evolving environments. by dealing with 
dynamic environment, we think of objects present in the environment moving in the scene 
(for example people) during the robot navigation. by evolving environment, we consider that 
configurations of the scene can change during time (door open or closed, chair, medical 
devices…) 
robustness, adaptability and cost of implementation of the developed technologies will be a 
major requirement. 
the approaches will be implemented on two experimental platforms: an automated 
wheelchair (inria platform at grenoble) and a smart walking aid (inria platform at 
sophia-antipolis).

*context*
the purpose of the project is to design a mobile communicating
companion robot, to provide assistance, and to ensure follow-up of
impaired people (elderly, disabled…). the role of the robot is to
perceive the situations of the “accompanied” person, his behavior and
needs, based on various sensors placed on both of them. the overall
objective is that the robot should be able to accompany and assist
impaired persons in a “natural” way, at home or during a walk, and
raise alerts in case of detected problem (fall, weakening…).
the work falls under the context of cooperation between two research
laboratories: lig (teams ama, magma, getalp) and gipsa-lab (team agpig).

*topic*
the work for the proposed phd will concentrate on the development of
perception and information processing system, which involves the
development of models for the dynamic analysis of complex situations.
the robot has been acquired in the framework of another university
project. it is built upon a robosoft robulab10 mobile platform
equipped with a robopec reeti expressive head, and video and audio
sensors to perceive its environment and analyze the followed person’s
movement and behavior. it is further able to capture physiological
data (heart and breathing rates…) from the sensors attached to the
person assisted.

data fusion techniques will be developed to analyze this
multidimensional heterogeneous information and to describe the person
situation, in terms that are physiological (emotional state, stress,
weakness…), behavioral (difficulty moving, fall…) and environmental
(presence of crowd, obstacles, ambient noise…). to cope with
uncertainty, incompleteness and inconsistency of the data, hypothesis
management and uncertainty models will be designed.

various problems are to be solved:

  * setting up the sensor and data transmission infrastructure for the
    robot and person assisted
  * low-level data processing (filtering, sampling), high level
    semantic information extraction (location characteristics, audio
    ambiance…)
  * setting up scenarios to create a learning database reflecting the
    various situations

 >from a more theoretical standpoint, the issues are:

  * fusion of heterogeneous data streams (video, audio, physiological
    sensors…)
  * modeling dynamic situations (transitions, events)
  * developing models to cope with data uncertainty, incompleteness
    and inconsistency and manage multiple hypotheses
  * development of active learning methods
  * designing methods for the detection of abnormal a priori unknown
    situations

111,2012,phd position in handibio laboratory in toulon - south east france,"hello,

a phd position is now opened in our biomecanics and rehabilitation  
robotics laboratory.
the applications should be sent before the 30th of july for a start  
september the 1st.



phd position in rehabilitation robotics and human motion analysis.
(claire dune, philippe gorce handibio and jean-pierre merlet inria-coprin)

clinical evaluation of frailty in the elderly is the first step to  
decide the degree of assistance they require. this evaluation is  
usually performed once and for all by filling standard forms with  
macro-information about standing and walking abilities, eg by  
measuring the time taken to walk 10m.

in this project, a new frailty evaluation tool will be developed,  
based on a standard  zimmer-frame. the basic idea is to equip a  
standard medical device with sensors (force, vision, laser) to track  
the evolution of elderly walking ability in their every day life.

the first challenge is to model the human-walker system in order to  
find relevant biomechanic indices that indicate the degree of frailty.  
the second point is to estimate these indices using the data acquired  
by the walker. the results will be compared to those obtained with  
standard human motion analysis systems.

requirements:
- masters degree in computer science, electrical engineering with honors,
- experience in robotics, signal processing,
- good programming skills in matlab/python c/c++
- a strong mathematical background is desirable

environment:
the handibio laboratory and the inria coprin research team are located  
in the south-east of france, respectively in the university town of  
toulon and sophia antipolis. since 2011, handibio as joined the inria  
national research project pal (personnaly assisted living), lead by

112,2012,"phd position in medical robotics at lsiit laboratory, strasbourg, france","the lsiit laboratory in strasbourg, france, offers a phd position in  
the avr research group (automatic control, vision and robotics) for a 
thesis project proposition named :
""developpment of measure solutions for medical flexible endoscopy""

*context : robotized assistance to flexible endoscopy
*
this phd position concerns the field of robotic assistance to medical 
interventions. we aim
at assisting procedures involving flexible systems such as flexible 
endoscopes. flexible systems are largely used in the medical field 
because they have the capability to reach distant areas of interest 
through tortuous and restricted natural channels (oesophagus, colon, 
urethra, veins, etc.). nowadays these systems are used for complex tasks 
such as complete surgical
operations. for these new uses the required positioning accuracy is 
important and in this context motorization and robotization appear as 
interesting solutions for manipulation problems. for instance 
robotization allows teleoperation modes or autonomous assistance.

however, in practice the automatic control of these flexible systems is 
difficult. because of the transmission of motion through long flexible 
shafts, often under constraints, non-linear behaviors are observed, 
which are dependent on multiple parameters. it is then difficult to 
obtain good models and consequently open-loop model-based control is not 
satisfying. for obtaining a good positioning accuracy in the operational 
space the use of an additional sensing system seems mandatory. up today 
most of works in this direction use electromagnetic sensors. they allow 
to quickly assess control schemes in the laboratory, but they are not 
directly usable in vivo.

*objectives : use of embedded camera for accurate positioning
*
in this phd thesis work we aim at exploring the possibilities offered by 
embedded vision for controlling robotized flexible systems and their 
instruments. three kinds of problems can be
studied :
     * positioning of the flexible system holding the camera with respect
     to the environment,
     * positioning simple instruments (without dof) passing through a
     channel of the flexible system with respect to this system and with
     respect to the environment,
     * positioning flexible instruments (with dofs) with respect to the
     flexible system and the environment.

the requirements will be mainly focused on accuracy but we will also be 
interested by the bandwidth, which is interesting for tracking 
physiological motion. besides the endoscopic images, data from motors 
encoders and flexible systems models will be used.

these approaches will first be assessed in the laboratory using the 
flexible robotic systems of lsiit and isir, for application to 
teleoperation and automatic motion. the solutions will also be
compared to the use of additional sensors usually proposed in the 
literature but not applicable in vivo, such as accelerometers or 
magnetic sensors, in order to show feasibility and / or limitations of 
the use of images.

the final objective is to assist the medical staff during operations 
using flexible systems. two main applications are planned: intraluminal 
surgery for electrosurgical cutting and ureteroscopy for laser lithiasis 
destruction.

*research environment : lsiit / isir collaboration inside the cami
       ""excellence laboratory""
*
the phd student will mainly work in the avr group in strasbourg, france
(newlsiit.u-strasbg.fr/avr_fr/index.php/accueil). he will be located on 
the medical robotic platform at the ircad in downtown strasbourg. ircad 
(www.ircad.fr) is a world-renowned
institute of research on digestive cancers.
the work will be realized in collaboration with the agathe team at isir 
(paris) inside the ""excellence laboratory"" cami (computer assisted 
medical intervention) a french multi-platforms laboratory dedicated to 
computer-assisted interventions (www.cami-labex.fr/).

the avr group has developed several robotic prototypes for intraluminal 
surgery. the isir team has also developed a motorized urological 
flexible system. the phd student will have access to these systems at 
the beginning of the thesis.
the thesis project is also partly integrated in the scope of strasbourg 
ihu (institut hospitalo- universitaire) mixsurg. the phd student will be 
able to perform in vivo validations at the ircad.

*expected candidate profile
*
the candidate must have a master degree or should have graduated from an 
engineering school with major in computer vision, robotics or image

113,2012,"phd student position and scholarship ""formal validation and verification of robotic systems"", verimag grenoble and laas/cnrs toulouse, france","a phd scholarship in the area of ""formal validation and verification of robotic systems"" 
is being offered jointly at verimag, grenoble and laas-cnrs, toulouse, for the fall 2012,
under the joint supervision of saddek bensalem and felix ingrand.
application deadline: july 31

formal validation and verification of robotic systems

verimag and laas started a few years ago an effort to provide a framework to deploy robust and formally verifiable robotics software. they combined a state of the art tool for developing functional modules of robotic systems (genom) with a component based framework for implementing embedded real-time systems (bip).  over the years, they have successfully developed a first version of the genom/bip component based design approach and applied it to the functional level of a complex exploration rover. this original approach allows to :
- produce a very fine grained formal computational model of the robot functional level; 
- run the bip engine on the real robot, which executes and enforces the model semantics at runtime; and 
- check the model offline for deadlock freedom, as well as other safety properties using tools such as d-finder.

the latest evolution of genom (genom3) is templates based, and while retaining the ""codels"", execution automata organization to implement functional module services and posters, it allows now to produce modules for different robotics middlewares (cslib, ros com, etc). in parallel, recent evolutions of the bip framework and toolset allow the use of timed models and models distribution over more than one cpu, and provide a realtime bip engine which is able to execute these models on the targeted platform.

the objective of this phd is to pursue the joint genom/bip effort to allow the development of robust and verifiable functional layer for robots, as well as to study the extensions of this approach toward the decisional level of the robot (planning/supervision). this will be applied to different platforms, in particular on a pr2 (willow garage) robot at laas but also on a fleet of uav each running its own genom/bip model, with execution coordination (performed in bip) among them. 

required candidate background:
- major in computer science
- software engineering and good programming skills (c/c++)

background knowledge in the following areas would be a plus.
- robot programming (fluency with tools like ros, genom, orocos, bcm, etc would be a plus)
- formal methods for validation and verification

the phd candidate will be mostly based at verimag in grenoble, but will make long visits (few months each year) at laas (toulouse) to implement and test its work on the various robotic platforms (pr2, uav, etc).

microscope) environment

contacts: *yassine.haddab at femto-st.fr ou philippe.lutz at femto-st.fr***
research institute: *as2m department of femto-st institute (besançon, 
france)**

the aimof the thesis is the development of advanced control, adapted to 
control systems in an sem for manipulation and characterization of 
micro/nano-objects. the planned work can be divided into two parts: the 
first one will focus on the characterization and modelling of noise 
inside a sem and the second will involve the control of microrobots end 
effectors to perform micromanipulation tasks on delicate components with 
small sizes (some dimensions may be as small as 100 nanometers or less). 
theseend effectors can be either microgrippers or tools developed at 
upmc / isir and femto-st.

the thesis is part of the anr project ""nanorobust"" bringing femto-st in 
besançon, the isir in paris, the lpn in marcoussis and irisa in rennes. 
thales research technologies is also involved in this work. the overall 
objective of nanorobust is to provide a robotic platform for 
nanomanipulation and physical characterization by scanning electron 
microscope.

the control ofmicrorobots and microsystems faces many difficulties 
related to the miniaturization. these difficulties are due on the one 
hand in researchinghigh performance in terms of resolution and accuracy, 
and partly to the high sensitivity of these systems to environmental 
conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) and noise. moreover, in these 
dimensional scales, the signal/noise ratios are unfavorable because of 
very low amplitudes of the useful signals. the actuation in micro/nano 
world is mostly done with active materials (piezoelectric, shape memory 
alloys, etc.) or deformable structures associated with a physical effect 
(electrostatic actuators, etc.). controlling the interaction force 
between the gripping tools and the nano-objects is essential to perform 
nanomanipulation and characterization. dynamic modelling of noise is an 
essential step to enable ultra precise control needed for handling and 
characterizing nano-objects.

*skills expected:* the candidate should havegood knowledge of control 
and signal processing. knowledge to use will be adapted based on the 
evolution of the thesis but a good starting point would be : state 
representation and state feedback control, observers and estimators 
synthesis, robust control, sensitivity analysis, noise filtering, 
optimal filtering (kalman, etc.) fourier analysis and digital signal 
processing using matlab and simulink. of course, some of these skills 
may be acquired during the thesis through training. furthermore, a first 
experience in micro/nano systems is welcome but not essential."

team:
the mean research objectives of interactive robotics group at uvsq is to
address open issues in the field of safety interaction, cooperation between
active systems and passive systems, redundancy and improvement of the energy
consumption of interactive robots.
our team has been investigated since 2005 a new actuating technology named
""integrated electro-hydraulic actuator"". the ieha's principle is based on
the possibility of producing the hydraulic power independently for each
joint in the robotic systems.
a humanoid robot named hydroïd based on ieha technology is under
development. ieha system was is covered with an international patent
(wo2009118366). three other internationals patents were achieved on the
hydroïd's mechanisms ( wo2009135694) ( wo2009144320) and ( wo2009147243).
mission:
context: although, many lower extremity prosthesis devices have been
realized during the last years, the development of the «perfect» prosthesis
is still an open question. transtibial and transfermoral amputees need
sophisticated prosthesis to make them regaining walking normal movement.
furthermore, we believe that, today, a suitable prosthesis must optimize the
used energy during the walk, and a comfortable connection with the living
part of the leg.
subject: the objective of this work is to build a testing machine for
transtibial and transfermoral prosthesis. the needed machine must be able to
reproduce the same dynamic and kinematics conditions applied on the
prosthesis during the normal use. special attention have to be paid for the
instrumentation of the contact surface between machine and the tested
prosthesis.
analyzing transfered force via this surface, will help us optimizing the
prosthesis's connection to the living leg.
a simulator of the machine need to be built under dynamic simulation
software like adams. a low-level and high-level control have to be done to
ensure the functionality of the system.
the hydroïd’s hip mechanism can play key role on the production of the
movements in this machine. hydraulic actuation helping production of high
force, hence the possibility to test a variety of prosthesis with a variety
walk speed and profile.
the scientific results of this work will be, the definition of the
theoretical and the technical criteria needed to build optimal transfermoral
and transtibial prosthesis.
candidates profile:
candidates, phd graduated, should justify full knowledge in theoretical
developments and in experimental techniques for mechatronic systems design.
experiences in the fields of hydraulic systems, dynamic simulations and
control well be greatly appreciated for this application. according to
project's context, the candidate is expected to contribute to the management
of the project, co-supervise thesis works and attend the meetings with
partners. the ability to work autonomously, creativity, and team spirit are
imperative.

124,2012,"post-doctoral position in medical robotics / computer vision, strasbourg, france","*the university of strasbourg (france) offers a 24 months post-doctoral 
position in the field*
*of medical robotics / computer vision, on the following project :

*""*event detection in non-vascular interventional radiology*""

the project aims at developing guiding and monitoring tools for medical 
procedures in interventional radiology, by combining computer vision and 
haptic feedback.

/keywords/: real-time registration, computer vision, fluoroscopy, haptics

the proposed project consists in developing visual/haptic supervision in 
non-vascular interventional radiology. the work will be applied to 
cement injection in vertebroplasty procedures. vertebroplasty is a 
minimally invasive interventional technique, which improves the 
treatment of patients enduring vertebrae fractures due to osteoporosis 
or bones tumours. it consists in injecting orthopaedic cement through a 
needle inserted in the vertebra cavity. the injection is monitored in 
real-time using an x-ray fluoroscope in order to continuously control 
cement diffusion. a solution for limiting the radiologist exposure to 
x-rays consists in developing robotized tools to inject the cement at a 
distance.we have already developed a master-slave system, which provides 
haptic feedback to the user for assisting such gestures. an ambitious 
project now consists in augmenting the radiologist perception rather 
than just providing injection efforts feedback. this post-doctoral 
project hence focuses on developing monitoring and guidance tools for 
improving cement injection, especially for allowing real-time detection 
of cement leakage outside the vertebra cavity, which can lead to embolism.

we propose to automatically detect cement leakage by coupling analysis 
of fluoroscopic images and monitoring of injection pressure. the 
objective is to make the detection as fast as possible but also to limit 
the risk of non detection which could result from a bad positioning of 
the imaging device. data fusion between image detection and pressure 
measurement can be obtained in different manners. image detection could 
be correlated with pressure variation measurements to confirm 
abnormality detection. conversely the point of view could be modified 
when pressure changes are detected but not coupled with visible leakage 
in the images. detection will be coupled to a haptic strategy, which 
will allow to stop or to adapt cement injection to make the gesture safer.

*working environment. candidate profile and funding*
the candidate will work at the medical robotic platform of the lsiit 
laboratory located at the ircad in the centre of strasbourg. he/she will 
have access to siemens interventional ct-scanner and siemens zeego 
robotized fluoroscopy system, both available at the mix-surg ihu (joint 
institute of hospital and university). the candidate shall have a 
succeeding research experience in computer vision, preferably in the 
medical context. knowledge and experience in automatic control, robotics 
or signal processing will be beneficial. inclination for experimental 
work and strong background in c/c++ programming are mandatory.

the project is supported by the idex (excellence initiative of the

job description:

based on its long experience in teleoperation (see [1]), the interactive
robotics laboratory (lri) of the cea list is pursuing research in the field of
operator gesture assistance. for that purpose, the laboratory developed a
robotic 3d supervisor in order to realize interactive physical simulations and to prepare missions. if the simulation is well suited to mission planning, 3d supervision is of interest only if the model and the location of the simulated environment accurately reflect reality.
various works within the lri and more generally within the cea list / diasi
participated in refining cad model parts using vision or force sensing (autonomous or supervised methods). this allows to locate the robot in its
environment and thus to assist the operator in manipulation or grasping tasks.
the main objectives of this post-doc are: 
1. to evaluate the existing localization methods, 
2. to contribute to the improvement of these methods, if necessary, 
3. to introduce a mixed approach of localization using vision and effort.

to do this, the candidates will have at his disposal experimental robotic means and software platforms for vision refinement and virtual reality, coming from different laboratories of cea list diasi (computer vision laboratory http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm, virtual reality laboratory
http://www.kalisteo.fr/lsi/en).
the post-doc will work in collaboration with laboratories mentioned above. the fields of application foreseen are autonomous manipulation, as well as
teleoperation and comanipulation.

     ""planning and acting in robotics"" 

is being offered at 

               laas-cnrs, university of toulouse, france

for the fall 2013, under the joint supervision of felix ingrand and malik ghallab.

this subject is at the intersection of ai and robotics. its objective is to explore and further develop in a systematic way the hierarchization approach to deliberation, from planning of abstract tasks to the triggering concrete commands. a first step is to study planning methods such as hierarchical task network (htn) and angelic hierarchical planning (ahp), and to extend them towards the needs of deliberate action in robotics. htns offer a convenient representation and practical algorithms beyond classical planning assumptions [1]. ahps follow a novel and promising approach for hierarchical planning with bonding techniques of reachable sets of states [2]. both approaches need however to be extended for the purpose of this project along several dimensions, among which:
• opportunistic and context dependent refinement techniques for htn and/or ahp, integrating execution control, supervision and plan revision mechanisms at various levels.
• durative actions with explicit time and temporal constraints between actions and exogenous events,
• uncertainty with different levels of inaccuracy and non-determinism at the different refinement levels,
• continuous and hybrid state variables and action variables along a hierarchy corresponding to the refinement hierarchy.
an important issue in this approach is to clarify what needs to be synthesized on-line in order to deal with new missions and environments, what can be synthesized off-line, parameterized and reused on-line for handling stable robot capabilities. htn, ahp and other planning techniques can be developed for performing these syntheses.
another concern to be taken into account is how to specify or acquire the environment and the robots models needed by planning and acting. ideas such as “compiling down” frequently performed tasks from a computationally expensive process into lower level skills and commands may be considered.

the research topics of the phd will cover one or several of the above scientific issues of deliberate actions in robotics, with conceptual and theoretical contributions as well as experimental validations. the latter will be deployed on one of the indoor robot platforms of laas, in particular on the pr2 robot.
the work will be carried out mainly within the ris group at laas-cnrs. this group is involved with partnerships with several robotics and ai labs in the world. one or several internships abroad during the thesis remain possible.

the persee project's objective is to robotize the deployment of a 
confocal endomicroscopic probe in a patient's abdomen to perform optical 
biopsies. a confocal endomicroscopic probe is a 2mm diameter flexible 
tubular device, which, when stably put in contact of an organ, provides 
real time video stream (12 images / sec) of the tissue at the cell scale 
(resolution=1 micrometer; image size=200x200 micrometers). to produce 
larger images, which are required for cancer diagnostics by 
pathologists, it is necessary to sweep the organ surface thanks to a 
robotic mechanism, to record the images, and then to assemble perform 
mosaicing.
based on the first results obtained in both the design and control of 
the device, see e.g. [1], the objective of the successful applicant will 
be to robustify the mosaicing algorithm thanks to the a priori knowledge 
of the motion of the probe produced by the robotic device.

147,2013,ph.d. position in ethics of robotics (with a focus on robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders),"the department of philosophy of the university of twente in the netherlands
is looking for a ph.d. student in ethics of robotics, with a focus on
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

your profile

a master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy (preferably but not
exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues
relating to  human-robot interaction.  highly motivated to become part of
an international team of researchers and to contribute to the success of
the dream project. good analytical skills. good organizational skills. good
communication skills in english, in writing as well as orally. creativity,
open-mindedness and ability to develop new ideas.

our offer

we offer you a four-year full-time ph.d. position, starting in 2014 (the
exact starting date will be communicated during the interview) and at the
end you should have completed your phd thesis the gross salary is € 2.083,-
per month in the first year going up to €2.664,- in the fourth year.
additionally, the university of twente provides excellent facilities for
professional and personal development, a holiday allowance (amounts to 8%),
an end-of-year bonus (amounts to 8,3%) an a number of additional benefits.
the position also comes with a travel budget.

information and application

for information you can contact the research  leader of the “ethics” work
package, dr. m.j.k coeckelbergh (e-mail: m.j.k.coeckelbergh at utwente.nl)
your application should contain the following documents: a letter of

topic: humanoid walking on deformable terrains


humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and poly-articulated
robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat surfaces,
slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated walking
gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic locomotion are
still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily flat) supports in
the environment. humans and animals however are capable to walk on
deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on highly
deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains: the first
ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or mud), the
second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least) part of it
when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).

in the frame of the forthcoming koroibot fp7 eu project (starting in october
2013), the topic of the thesis is to make current humanoids capable to walk
on such deformable terrains, by developing adequate models and controllers.
one particularity of the koroibot project is to measure human strategies
that may possibly inspire the strategy of the controllers. this study will
be performed at one of the koroibot team and the interested candidate will
be involved in the recording and the interpretation of motion capture data
of human walking on different deformable terrains. these data can be
exploited to design the control strategy for humanoid walking. once
implemented and experimented (under similar human measurement conditions),
we will compare the results and assess the robustness and the quality of the
humanoid robot walks.

these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging
scenarios involving the hrp-2 and hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the thesis will be conducted at the cnrs-aist joint robotics
laboratory, umi 3218/crt at tsukuba, japan and also partly at the cnrs-um2
lirmm at montpellier, france. 3 months shall be spent at one of the
partners’ laboratory to conduct human-motion capture data.

context and environment

---------------------------------

the french government has decided to invest over 2 years 10 million euro 
for the equipment of national research platforms in various domains of 
robotics. (investissements d’avenir).

this national network of platforms is called robotex. the main goal of 
robotex is to setup coherent infrastructures of technical equipments in 
order to:

· promote scientific exchange and development of collaborative work 
between academic research teams, companies and end-users, and provide 
durable and reusable expertise and know–how,

· give researchers high-level equipments with a facilitated access,

· increase the visibility of the french robotics academic research and 
its international impact. it particularly concerns the strengthening of 
its european scientific leadership, and the increase of collaborative 
works with leading european countries as well as at an international level,

· boost the competitiveness of french companies and open new markets 
based on robotic technologies.

the experimental platforms of the robotex national network mostly belong 
to joint cnrs-university laboratories with strong research and 
development activities in robotics, and having the necessary human 
resources to give access and provide optimal exploitation of the 
platforms. this national network links together most of the leading 
academic robotics research teams in france.

robotics team at irccyn is organized around 4 main research areas: 
mobile robotics,

title: *human robot physical interactions with an exoskeleton for
rehabilitation: sharing of control in joint articular dimension and
sensorimotor reinforcement.


*phd topics :*
the project is to develop, setup and evaluate some innovative control modes
dedicated to the neuro-rehabilitation of upper limbs in hemiparetic
patients. it is based on the exoskeleton platform able (cea-list) and on an
innovative control principle in joint space developed in the laboratory
during the project anr-psirob brahma.
the main objective is to develop a set of controllers allowing the
exoskeleton to apply different types of constraints on the human arm,
independently in the joint space or in the end-effectors’ space. a new
control mode aiming to impose a different coordination schema (synergy) has
already been developed. this exploited both the redundancy of the
exoskeleton with 4 dof in a simple pointing task (3 dof) and the use of
viscous fields in the perspective to correct abnormal synergies in the
patients. the aim is now to improve this innovative mode, which is the only
one taking advantage of the structure of the exoskeleton by reference to
the modes developed for the structures with a single contact point with the
human.

*the main objectives of the thesis are :*
- to investigate the possibility to use force fields in the joint space of
the human arm.
- to develop a set of tools for the analysis and the quantification of the
movements produced by a human wearing/using an exoskeleton.
- to evaluate the sensorimotor consequences of the human-robot interaction
with an exoskeleton during elementary gestures in a virtual environment

more generally, the principal objective of this thesis is to develop two
kinds of robots' control modes either assistive (i.e. guiding arm
coordination) or disturbing (inducing sensations and encouraging active
corrections) along with with associated methodology for evaluation. these
modes will be experimented in healthy subjects and their proof of concept
will be tested in patients thanks to clinical collaborations. finally, the
aim will be to prepare a clinical evaluation and comparison of these
control modes in a clinical setting.

*required qualifications :*
- b.s. or m.s. in mechanical/electrical/computer engineering;
- knowledge in programming (c, c++), real-time control architectures for
robots and data analysis (matlab);
- highly self-motivated and persistent with strong critical and analytical
thinking skills.
- ability and desire to conduct experiments with humans and for the
analysis of experimental data.

*preferred qualifications :*
- knowledge in virtual reality, man-machine interfaces and haptics ;
- past experience in rehabilitation or assistive robotics.

an early start in december 2013 is desired, therefore the application
deadline is the 5th of november 2013.

*application instructions:*
phd application should be sent by email to jarrasse at isir.upmc.fr and should
include the following attachments:
- statement of motivation and relevant experience
- cv (curriculum vitae) / resume
- copies of university certificates
- list of attended classes and grades

department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of safety compliant behavior for humanoids in haptic interaction   


in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program active compliance behaviors of a humanoid robot in haptic interaction with the environment or a human. tasks carried out in contact with the environment or humans call de-facto for safety issues. not only should the human partner not be harmed in any situation, but the robot must also ensure its own safety (since the human can be a strong source of perturbation to the robot). this challenging problem is of prime importance. while studies in particular at dlr in germany have considered this issue in previous (phriends, viactors) and current (saphari) european projects, none of them has considered the problem of safety in human-humanoid interaction that is linked to the potential of falling with a human. of course fundamentals in terms of admissible impedance, impulse forces, compliant hardware reported in robotic safety will be considered. but additional ones, namely humanoid falling when being in close physical contact with a human, calls for a different approach in terms of reflex strategies and the control that is to be implemented in addition to non-harming contacts in direct interaction. we will investigate a set of strategies to guarantee safety of the haptic interaction in most critical circumstances. aldebaran partner will provide knowledge related to norms and standards to be considered and will use the results of this project to improve the understanding of this very new kind of man-machine interaction. a lot has been told about safety in robotics but real experiments with humanoids are still missing, and this research will bring new valid data into the discussion. in order to do so, we will identify situations where the motion is not viable (i.e. the interaction is not controllable) and having human-in-the-loop adds difficulty to this process. assuming this, we will propose taxonomy of these critical situations and devise for each a set of rules/guidelines/policies to avoid it and another set of rules/guidelines/policies to deal with it in conjunction with the available norms and standards.

159,2013,post-doctoral position at cnrs/aist jrl,"*topic*: *humanoid walking on deformable terrains *





humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and
poly-articulated robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat
surfaces, slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated
walking gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic
locomotion are still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily
flat) supports in the environment. humans and animals however are capable
to walk on deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on
highly deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains:
the first ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or
mud), the second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least)
part of it when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).



in the frame of the koroibot fp7 eu project, the topic of this post-doc is
to make current humanoids capable to walk on such deformable terrains, by
developing adequate models and controllers. one particularity of the
koroibot project is to measure human strategies that may possibly inspire
the strategy of the controllers. this study will be performed at one of the
koroibot team and the interested candidate will be involved in the
recording and the interpretation of motion capture data of human walking on
different deformable terrains. these data can be exploited to design the
control strategy for humanoid walking. once implemented and experimented
(under similar human measurement conditions), we will compare the results
and assess the robustness and the quality of the humanoid robot walks.



these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging
scenarios involving the hrp-2 and hrp-4 humanoid robots.


 *locations*: the post-doc will be conducted at the cnrs-aist joint
robotics laboratory, umi 3218/crt at tsukuba, japan and also partly at the
cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. 3 months shall be spent at one of
the partners’ laboratory to conduct human-motion capture data.


*duration*: 2 years, possible extension to 3 years.



we are looking for a candidate with a good background in humanoid walking,
automatics or mathematics. a fair knowledge in c++ and python would be a
plus for the experimental part.

166,2014,one postdoc position in bci motor mapping in inria south france,"postdoctoral position: adaptive brain-motor mapping

  neuroprosthetics is an interdisciplinary field related to 
neuroscience, bioelectronics and biomedical engineering, which aims to 
substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive function that might have been 
damaged as a result of an injury or a disease. one of the challenging 
issues in motor prosthesis is the large variety of patient situations 
depending on the type of neurological disorder. to overcome the current 
limited performance of such systems, a robust bio-signal processing and 
a model-based control taking about the actual sensory motor state with 
biosignal feedback would bring a break-through and allow to progress 
toward adaptive neuroprosthesis.
 recent advances of brain-computer-interfaces (bci) have opened a new 
communication channel for patients, who can transmit their movement 
intention via brain signals. 
the functionality and controllability of motor prosthesis can be further 
improved by taking advantage of computational mapping between emg 
(electromyography) of muscle, eeg (electroencephalography) of brain, and 
other modalities of biofeedback information.

the first objective is to enhance the classification algorithm to 
extract the subject's motor intention from eeg signal in motor-imagery 
based bci. the computational modeling between multichannel emg and eeg 
will involve advanced feature extraction, dimension reduction and 
classification algorithms. moreover emg signals of multiple muscles and 
muscle modeling including skeletal dynamics models will help in 
obtaining the detailed motion intention of the subject.

the second objective is to develop a bilateral learning architecture. in 
bci, adaptive decoding of eeg signals is desirable because brain signals 
change over time during the learning of the task. in motor control, it 
is also known that we change how we use our joints and a way to deal 
with redundancy problems in articulation. in emg analysis, the change of 
motor usage can be captured. adaptive modeling of emg allows the 
evaluation of skill acquisition.

by jointly analyzing both the eeg and emg modifications, we investigate 
how eeg signal may change along with actual motor coordination changes. 
by modeling both of these adaptive features, this framework will try to 
capture the bilateral learning architecture of both the brain and the 
motor system.

this project is associated with inria openvibe project (http://openvibe.inria.fr/
)

required skills: a strong background in signal processing, control, and 
machine learning is required. fluency in english, and excellent

----------------------
thematic:

this thesis is in the field of medical robotics and focuses on the 
development of solutions for tracking the deformations of organs using 
medical imaging devices based on scanning imaging technologies 
(ultrasound and oct). the interest is to allow future implementation of 
robotic applications for assistance during minimally invasive surgical 
procedures, such as needle insertion for biopsies, localized treatment 
of tumors [1] or in the context of minimally or non-invasive surgical 
microrobotics. to this end, taking into account tissue deformations due 
to the patient's physiological movement and physical interaction of 
surgical instruments with the targeted anatomical element is a crucial 
step to ensure a safe and effective robotic assistance [2].

----------------------
context:

ultrasound imaging and oct can provide 3d ​​images in real-time in 
opposite to magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and are not invasive for 
the patient in contrast to x-ray imaging. therefore these imaging 
modalities are well appropriated to allow biopsies and surgical 
procedures in interventional radiology [3].

3d ultrasound and oct work on a very similar principle that consists in 
sending an ultrasonic or optical infrared (for oct) wave along a scan 
line and measuring the signal that is reflected by the interfaces of 
tissue traversed by the wave. the 3d image is then reconstructed by 
automaticallysweeping the wave along successive scanning lines on the 
area of ​​interest.

however the scanning is performed sequentially thanks to an 
electronic/mechanical sweeping which produces artifacts in the 
reconstructed image in case the observed anatomical structure moves and 
deforms due to the physiological motion of the patient.
----------------------

research work:

this thesis will focus on the development of an approach able to 
compensate these artifacts by controlling the sweeping in a clever 
manner that will allow a more accurate tracking of the organ 
deformations [4]. the idea is to control the direction of each scanning 
line in order it intersects on specific points in soft tissue and to use 
the wave response time to directly estimate the motion speed of the 
anatomical structure. to this end, we plan to use a preoperative digital 
model of the targeted organ acquired by mri or ct. the deformation of 
the model will be online adapted during the intraoperative imaging 
performed with ultrasound or oct thanks to observations obtained during 
the monitored sweeping of the wave.
----------------------

expected results:

the main contribution of this thesis would be a novel approach that 
automatically performs an intraoperative registration of a deformable 
model with an observed soft tissue structure while compensating the 
artifacts induced by the scanning imaging technology.
----------------------

competence:

knowledge in computer vision and applied mathematics are required, as 
well as good programming skills in c++.

robot navigation testing in virtual worlds

laas-cnrs seeks to hire an outstanding doctoral researcher in robotics and dependability in toulouse, france. the successful candidate will collaborate with the ris (robotics) and tsf (dependability) teams to develop a systematic method for simulation-based testing of autonomous robot software.

an autonomous robot should perform a variety of tasks without any human supervision, in various, complex and uncertain environments. in order to deploy such systems in human or critical environments, rigorous validation is of paramount importance. the tests, for safety and cost constraints, must first be realized using simulation in virtual worlds. morse (modular openrobots simulation engine) is a simulator developed at laas-cnrs to serve that purpose. it provides the right level of simulation (perception/action) to validate the execution of complex plans. the objective of the phd work is to develop a test method that exploits such simulation facilities to place the robotic system in a wide variety of operational situations and observe how it faces them. the method will be based on the automated generation of virtual worlds, like worlds generated in video games. the main contribution will be on how to synthesize the virtual worlds in such a way that they exhibit the safety-relevant corner cases, and ensure adequate coverage of the functionalities deployed on the robot. the method will be applied to navigation functionalities developed in genom, which are deployed on real mobile robots at laas. a demonstrator will be implemented using the morse simulator.

desired profile and role
-----------------------
the candidate is expected to:
- have a master in computer science,
- have some background and interest in robotics and/or software validation,
- be fluent in english (written and spoken).

the main tasks of the phd student will be to:
- get acquainted with the morse robots simulator and the genom3 module generator tool
- propose a framework for morse world generation and selection according to test criteria
- define plans and scripts which will be tested in simulation
- conduct a case study and evaluate the proposed solution

179,2014,postdoc opening at lirmm montpellier: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts,"laboratory: lirmm (cnrs/university montpellier 2), montpellier, france
department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts   

in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program a haptic observer returning the localization and magnitude of external contacts on the humanoid body. this will be done through fusion of the information from sensors embedded on the robot (including tactile sensing when available). such a haptic observer will first be developed based on classical available sensors, that are: force sensors at the ankles and hands’ wrists, accelerometers, gyro, inclinometers, desired postures (desired joints), imu and motor torques’ estimation. eventually, an extended haptic observer will also be developed to integrate tactile and force sensing if available, on parts of the humanoid robots. one of the distinguishing issues we would like to deal with is the integration of rgbd vision as part of the haptic observer. change in vision viewpoint, flow, may provide a lot of information on contact. needless to say that in some configurations, vision can also assess the localization of a non-desired or desired contact. the resulting robust whole-body haptic sensing observer will ideally return: the number of contacts, their localization on each link, the external wrench per link, distributed pressure per contact and force estimation (include tangential one) per link. the proposed observer must meet robustness and real-time performances to be used in closed-loop control for tasks such as: multi-contact stabilization, visio-haptic motion control and multi-contact planning.

candidates with background in estimation/identification, observers design in control theory, signal processing are preferred. further details can be obtained during the interview.

these researches and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assistance scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organised in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

198,2015,"two phd positions in visual-based  navigation and control for uavs at inria/irisa-cnrs, rennes, france"," the lagadic group at inria/irisa-cnrs rennes, france http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html has *two* open phd positions in the field of visual-based navigation and  control for uavs. **************      phd topics      ************** 1) visual predictive control for uavs -- description -- visual servoing is a well-known class of techniques meant to control the  pose of a robot from visual input by considering an error function  directly defined in the image (sensor) space. these techniques are  particularly appealing since they do not require, in general, a full  state reconstruction, they typically grant good robustness against  miscalibrations and model inaccuracies, and are computationally cheap  w.r.t. a full state estimation step. the goal of this phd scholarship is to investigate how to exploit the  visual servoing framework for effectively controlling the pose of a  quadrotor uav equipped with an onboard camera imu and embedded  processing power. the intended applications span precise positioning  over ground (moving) objects, trajectory following and formation  control. because of the quadrotor underactuation and inherent sensor  limitations (mainly limited camera fov), a special emphasis will be  placed on the use of model predictive control techniques (or similar  ideas) for explicitly dealing with this kind of constraints during flight. a full, sound (and onboard) implementation of all the developed schemes  on the quadrotor platforms available in the group will also be part of  the phd goals. -- candidate's expected profile -- the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of robotics, estimation and control. familiarity with quadrotor flight  control, visual-based control, predictive/optimal control, optimization,  image processing are a plus. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, engineering, applied mathematics (or  related fields) is required. ue or swiss nationality is also required  for applying to this position. -- salary -- full-time 3-year position paid according to french salary schemes. 2) robust visual state estimation and sensing for uavs -- description -- the goal of this phd position is to develop robust (and real-time)  computer vision algorithms for recovering the ""state"" of a quadrotor uav  from onboard sensing (mainly 2d/3d cameras and imu) and processing  power. here, the term ""state"" serves as a placeholder for, e.g.,  relative position w.r.t. other uavs in the scene, identity of  neighboring uavs, relative position w.r.t. surrounding obstacles,  velocity over ground, and so on. in summary, any relevant information  needed for controlling the quadrotor motion over ground, for avoiding  obstacles, and for keeping desired relative displacements with nearby  quadrotors (for the sake of formation control). the developed algorithms should possess a good degree of robustness  w.r.t. real-world conditions, for instance by avoiding, as much as  possible, the use of special markers or other artificial aids for  segmenting the environment or neighboring uavs. while the main  application will be indoor flight, extension to outdoor scenarios will  also be considered. -- candidate's expected profile -- the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of computer vision (for robotics applications), image processing and  pattern matching/classification. familiarity with the use of vision in  the context of quadrotor navigation/flight control (e.g., visual  odometry, visual slam) is a plus. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++, ros, and of the  relevant computer vision libraries (visp, opencv, pcl). scientific  curiosity, autonomy and ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, engineering (or related fields) is

environments* without the  possibility of resorting to ?external aids? besides the team own skills. the goal of this postdoc is to advance the state-of-the-art by  contributing to the conception, development and actual testing of novel  algorithms for allowing a group of multiple robots to autonomously  navigate in unknown, unstructured and cluttered environments by solely  resorting to their *""local skills""*, that is, *local onboard sensing*  (mainly vision) and *local communication*. quadrotor uavs equipped with  onboard cameras, imus and local communication capabilities will be the  target robotic platform for all algorithms. a rough list of possible  topics envisaged during the postdoc is as follows: - decentralized formation control from visual feedback  (*bearing-formation control*) for a group of quadrotor uavs - decentralized localization from visual feedback  (*bearing-localization*) for a group of quadrotor uavs - exploitation of graph theoretical tools (e.g., *connectivity* and  *bearing-rigidity*) for cooperatively estimating global quantities of  interest (e.g., common inertial reference frame, relative pose of the  agents in the group) - robustness against sensor limitations (e.g., limited camera fov,  occlusions) - robustness against delays, noise, packet losses and link failures - anonymity and correspondence-less cooperative control and estimation the initial postdoc duration is *12 months* but with the possibility of  extending it in case of mutual interest. *********** candidates' expected profile *********** the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of robotics, estimation and control with a focus on multi-robot  formation control and cooperative localization and, in general,  familiarity with the relevant multi-robot and multi-agent literature.  previous experience in visual-based control/estimation is a plus.  previous experience with quadrotor uavs is a plus but not strictly required. the candidate is expected to contribute mostly on the algorithmic side  (conception, analysis and design of cooperative formation  control/localization schemes from onboard measurements). however, an  implementation on the quadrotor platforms available in the group is also  welcome. co-supervision of the phd students involved in the project is  also welcome. the candidate should be knowledgeable about c/c++, ros and  matlab/simulink. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and ability to  work independently are also expected. a phd degree in computer science,  engineering, applied mathematics (or related fields) is required. *********** salary *********** full-time position paid according to french salary schemes. ***********  environment *********** the lagadic group, headed by francois chaumette, http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experiences in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision and sensor-based control for robotics  applications. the facilities available in the group include three 6-dof  manipulator arms, a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a state-of-the-art  human-size humanoid robot (romeo), a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an  indoor large testing arena instrumented with vicon. the candidates will be under the supervision of *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/paolo.robuffo_giordano.html and will work in close collaboration with other members of the lagadic  group involved in the project. the lagadic group is part of the inria/irisa lab that spreads its  activities in 30 research teams working in computer science, signal  processing, and control. it involves about 650 people, including 120  professors and assistant professors, 100 full-time researchers, 80  administrative staff, and 250 phd students. ***********  how to apply  *********** interested candidates must send to dr. paolo robuffo giordano (prg [at]  irisa.fr) the following material: - motivation letter - detailed cv - name of at least two referees - any relevant information for proving a good match with the postdoc  description and expected profile of the candidates the positions will remain open until a satisfactory candidate will be found. --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) lagadic team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/paolo.robuffo_giordano.html youtube: http://www.youtube.com/user/mpirobotics"

205,2015,phd position - femto-st institute,"    phd position in microrobotics location: as2m dep, femto-st institute, france full description: handling objects smaller than 100?m remains a challenge that is of  utmost importance for several application fields, from electronics to  biology. microrobotics has developed contact based techniques using  tools usually inspired from their macrometer size counterparts, such as  grippers. however these tools are most of the time dedicated to objects  larger than 100?m. when smaller objects are considered non contact  actuation is commonly used. it is based on force fields produced by  remote sources. several actuation principles have been investigated,  among which magnetophoresis, acoustic waves, optical tweezers and  dielectrophoresis. these techniques differ by the nature of the objects  that can be handled (for example magnetophoresis can only be applied to  magnetic objects), the level of force that can be applied on the objects  and the technical constraints induced by the actuators (compactness of  the final prototype). to ensure long range displacements, in particular  for conveying of the parts before characterization or assembly, fluidic  flows inside microchips are often used. objectives the goal of this thesis is to perform active control based on  dielectrophoretic actuation. compared to state of the art systems this  work will implement closed loop control of the trajectory of the objects  inside the chips. enabling precise positioning control is a necessary  prerequisite to perform complex operations inside the chip in the  future, such as the mechanical characterization of the objects  (stiffness measurements for example) before sorting or the assembly of  different parts (figure 1). two key scientific and technological problematics will be addressed in  this project: (i) the trajectory and positioning control of the objects  and (ii) the integration of all the functions in a unique integrated  device. to be competitive compared to the current systems, two major  challenges should be addressed: (i) the system should not necessitate  any complex preliminary step to be used by (it should be plug and play)  and (ii) thousands of objects must be handled each second. it  necessitates high speed trajectory control. first proofs of concept have been demonstrated in the as2m department of  femto-st institute with high speed closed loop trajectory control of  artificial beads using dielectrophoresis actuation in a petri dish  (figure 2). dielectrophoresis consists in applying a non-uniform  electric field to dielectric objects. these objects will experience a  force either attractive or repulsive depending on the frequency of the  electric field and of characteristic constants of the objects and the  medium. electrodes are commonly deposited on a glass wafer to produce  the electric field. this technique can be used in combination with  microfluidic channels. this first step has shown the relevance of the  approach but several major changes must be made to adapt it to the  current system. the dielectrophoretic trajectory control should now be  included into microfluidic channels. in addition trajectory control is  usually based on visual feedback. however it requires a delicate  alignment between the camera and the chip, as well as adequate  lightening conditions. to avoid these cumbersome steps this thesis  proposes to use impedance spectrometry measurements to perform  trajectory control. impedance spectrometry consists in measuring the  variation of impedance due to the presence of an object between the  electrodes. description of the work this thesis will rely on the expertise of as2m department in femto-st  where the phd student will be located and the prof. p. renaud team in  epfl (switzerland) for the impedance spectrometry measurements. they  have recently shown proofs of concept of morphological measurements of  cells using this technique. similarly the impedance spectrometry  measurements also vary according to the position of the cell with  respect to the electrodes, and thus can be used as a position sensor.  tight collaborations with epfl (that is located 2 hours away from  besancon) are forecasted. several scientific challenges will be tackled: -    the modelling of the chip including both the fluidic aspects and  the dielectrophoretic ones used to move the objects. this model will be  used for: (i) the definition of design rules for the chips (including  the fluidic channels and the electrodes) and (ii) getting a model of the  system that will be inverted in real time to compute the input of the  system for closed loop control, -    the determination of control laws dedicated to the non linearities  of the dielectrophoretic field and to the low inertia of the objects  inducing large accelerations, -    the study of detection and tracking algorithms dedicated to  innovative position sensors (impedance spectroscopy measurements) which  guarantee the compactness of the chip. in particular the model giving  the position based on the impedance measurements will be studied , -    the realization of an experimental prototype (made in clean room  facilities). all the methodologies proposed during this thesis will be validated  experimentally. a prototype will be fabricated by the phd student  (assisted by the staff of the clean room of femto-st) and tests will be  performed on artificial beads. as a first proof of concept the final  prototype of this chip will be validated by a cell sorting operation. research institute femto-st institute is a joint research unit which is affiliated with the  french national centre of scientific research (cnrs), the university of  franche-comt? (ufc), the national school of mechanical engineering and  microtechnology (ensmm), and the belfort-montb?liard university of  technology (utbm). femto-st is active in different fields of engineering  science: computer science, mechanics, optics and telecommunications,  mechatronics, i.e. micro/nanorobotics and advanced control,  time-frequency, energetics and fluidics. femto-st hires around 700  persons, and is organized according to seven research departments. it  also runs a microfabrication technology centre, which is recognized  nation-wide, for mixing technologies from microelectronics and  micromechanics. the thesis will be done in the as2m department, automatic control &  micro-mechatronic systems. the research led in as2m department deals  with automatic control, robotics, mechatronics and industrial  engineering. this department has been working on microrobotics for more  than fifteen years, notably for micro/nanomanipulation and assembly,  development of components, systems and control methods to achieve tasks  at the microworld. with around 30 persons involved in microrobotics,  as2m is the biggest team in the world on microrobotics and is usually  involved in several european and national projects. the department has knowledge on non-contact manipulation and on high  speed trajectory control which will be exploited in this phd. the  candidate will get access to all the scientific equipment, including  finite element modeling software, micromanipulation platforms, clean  room facilities, etc. he/she will get the opportunity to present his/her  work in international conferences and journals. application the candidate should have a strong motivation for experimental work as  well as for team work. background in one of the following areas would be  appreciated: robotics, control, micromechatronics, microfabrication.  however, any application presenting a strong scientific background will  be considered. the candidate will work in a french laboratory, but the working language  will be either french or english according to the candidate skills. contacts: to apply, send a curriculum vita, a motivation letter and if available  the master grades to: michael.gauthier 'at' femto-st.fr aude.bolopion 'at' femto-st.fr before may, 12th 2015 --  aude bolopion as2m department - femto-st institute 24 rue alain savary, f-25000 besan?on, france +33 (0)3 81 40 29 25 -- view this message in context: http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/jobs-phd-position-femto-st-institute-tp5711333.html sent from the robotics-worldwide mailing list archive at nabble.com."

207,2015,phd positions available at the italian  institute of technology to work on the icub," dear roboticists, this is to advertise the following phd positions with scholarship at the icub facility, istituto italiano di tecnologia. the positions are available through the phd course of bioengineering and robotics, curriculum on advanced and humanoid robotics. successful applicants will join the icub facility department at the istituto italiano di tecnologia in genoa (http://www.iit.it/icub). for additional details please check: http://www.iit.it/en/openings/phd-calls.html ******** theme 1: articulatory information for automatic speech recognition in human-robot verbal interaction tutors: giorgio metta, leonardo badino description:  state-of-the art automatic speech recognition (asr) systems produce remarkable results in some scenarios but still lags behind human level performance in several real usage scenarios and perform poorly whenever the type of acoustic noise, the speaker's accent and speaking style are ""unknown"" to the system, i.e., are not sufficiently covered in the data used to train the asr system. the goal of the present theme is to create a robust speaker-independent key phrases recognition system where commands delivered by a user to a robot (i.e., the key phrases) have to be recognized in unconstrained utterances (i.e., utterances with hesitations, disfluencies, additional out-of-task words, etc.), in the challenging conditions of human-robot verbal interaction where speech is typically distant (to the robot) and noisy. to improve the robustness of the recognition system to intrinsically challenging and/or unknown conditions we will create recognition systems that combine acoustic features with predicted vocal tract articulatory movements (canevari et al. 2013) thus exploiting the articulatory representation of speech where phonetic targets (i.e., the articulatory targets necessary to produce a given sound) are largely invariant and complex phenomena observed in speech are can be compactly modeled. requirements:  the successful candidate will have a degree in computer science, bioengineering, physics or related disciplines. a background in speech and language processing is a plus. reference:  [1] canevari, c., badino, l., fadiga, l., metta, g., ""cross-corpus and cross-linguistic evaluation of a speaker-dependent dnn-hmm asr system using ema data"", interspeech workshop on speech production for automatic speech recognition, lyon, france, 2013. contacts: leonardo.badino at iit.it, giorgio.metta at iit.it ******** theme 2: whole-body real-time motion planning and control in compliant humanoids: theory and implementation on the icub tutors: francesco nori, giorgio metta, daniele pucci description:  the icub is among the few humanoids capable of whole-body motion control while being compliant to perturbations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrpbssqer3a). these capabilities are possible thanks to the icub peculiar sensors such as whole-body distributed tactile and force sensing. these sensors allow the icub to simultaneously control joint movements, joint torques and interaction forces. within this context, motion control is still an open research activity since previous approaches mainly dealt with kinematic movement planning. the icub instead needs a dynamic planner to simultaneously plan movements, torques and interaction forces. the goal of the proposed theme is to develop a kinematic and dynamic motion control software. given a control task, the foreseen controller will compute not only the kinematics (i.e. joint trajectories) but also the dynamics (i.e. joint torques and interaction forces) to perform the task. among the various solutions to the problem, optimal control will represent a primary focus of attention. specific tasks will include multi-contact motion planning [2], whole-body motion planning [3] and non-rigid contact motion planning. the project will be conducted within the context of a european project and the candidate will be asked to spend a six months experience in a foreigner country as a visiting ph.d. student. requirements:  candidate is requested to have a background in control theory, computer science and/or robotics. specific background in optimal control will be positively evaluated. special requirements: this theme is supported by an itn-h2020 research grant (secure). candidates should satisfy the eligibility criteria of the marie sk?odowska-curie actions. the position is suitable for candidates who have not have resided or carried out their main activity in italy for more than 12 months in the last 3 years preceding their recruitment. note: the position is associated with a considerably higher salary than a regular studentship and offers many opportunities to travel to the other european partners in the network. reference: [1] f nori, s traversaro, e jorhabib, f romano and d del prete a.;

point of the  trajectory is a key element, which allow to give priority to the  temporal definition of the trajectory, or alternatively to the tracking  accuracy of the associated path. similarly, the temporal evolution along  the trajectory at the controller level can be parameterized to accept a  delay or not. for example, following to an unforeseen event that  generate a delay along the trajectory, the robot can choose to trigger  an error, to continue with a delay or to continue compensating the  delay. these functionalities are presented here for the movement; one  aspect of the proposed work consists in the extension of these concepts  to temporal functions describing forces and stiffnesses. it would be interesting to realize numerous interactive manipulation  tasks, both for service and industrial cooperative robotic. a study  carried out among quadriplegic people as part of the anr-assist  <http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?projet=anr-07-robo-0011>  project showed that these persons are very interested in recovering  their privacy. help with dressing, for example, cannot be described only  in terms of motions. it is necessary to precise acceptable stiffness,  position and force limits. we had to deal with the same kinds of  problems for an industrial collaborative assembly. the description of  the interactive motions to define the controller includes not only the  trajectory, but also stiffness and force evolution. the aim of this work is to define temporal models for interactive  manipulation tasks and then to show that planners and controllers based  on these models offer interesting possibilities. these models should  also help to improve communication between different robot modules, for  example a planner and a controller. experiments and validations will be carried out with the robots of the  laas robots platform <https://www.laas.fr/public/en/robots-platform>,  such as two pr2 from willow garage and jido equipped with two lwr-4 kuka  arms. the team is also involved in different research project related to  robot interaction (saphari <http://www.saphari.eu/>, spencer  <http://spencer.eu/>, mardi). to apply, please send your cover letter and cv to: daniel.sidobre at laas.fr looking forward to your applications.      daniel. -- daniel sidobre   ma?tre de conf?rences ?

                   integrate viewpoints dealing with mas requirements, and cover all aspects of multi-agent systems, including agent models, interaction, communication (i.e. fipa mas standards ), and organization paradigms. ?

225,2015,open phd position - 3d mapping and  localization of fast vehicles," open phd thesis position: 3d mapping and localization of fast vehicles with non-global   acquisition cameras (rolling shutter, dynamic roi) context dense 3d reconstruction of extremely fast moving objects could   contribute to various applications such as 3d scene interpretation and   accident avoidance, body structure analysis and so on. many consumer   cameras sold today are equipped with cmos sensors with rolling   shutter. these cameras are renowned for being both low cost, low power   and fast. these qualities are especially popular for embedded   applications. however, sequential exposure of the pixels in these   cameras causes geometric distortions in the image when either the   camera or the scene moves, making classical structure from motion   algorithms less accurate or even inadequate. recently, 3d   reconstruction methods taking into account these distortions have been   proposed. some approaches require continuity and ""smoothing"" of the   movement during the shooting but also between the views thus imposing   an acquisition at very high frequency. other approaches consider   specific movements such as pure translation for example. objectives the work in this thesis concerns simultaneous 3d reconstruction and   localization using fast cmos cameras, with non global shutter   acquisition mode such as rolling shutter or dynamically reconfigurable   rois (region of interest), embedded on a vehicle or an uav. we aim to   develop a technique based on the smallest amount of data (ideally a   one-shot method) that reconstructs instantaneous 3d shape and motion.   this will allow a location at high speed without latency. moreover,   motion estimate will introduce a prediction model to be used for   feature tracking algorithms in order to effectively boost the matching   of features between images. the first objective is to propose methods such as bundle adjustment   which take into account the effect of the rolling shutter or   sequential roi acquisition, and which operate under the same shooting   conditions than conventional methods (that is to say with a sequence   of images taken at more or less remote poses). one possible solution   consists in taking into account the vehicle evolution model (for   example non-holonomy constraint) in order to compensate the loss of   rigidity of the scene assumed in all classical structure from motion   techniques. a second challenging task is to adapt the methods of feature matching   between the images to make the reconstruction as dense as possible.   indeed, existing methods consider that local effects of rolling   shutter are non significant and thus use the same algorithms and   descriptors to match the points of interest between views from a   sequence. the objective of this thesis is therefore to define a local   model for pattern distortions induced by the rolling shutter in the   vicinity of a points of interest. modeling the impact on known   descriptors such as sift or surf is also planned to improve the   robustness and the efficiency of the matching process. the candidate should have a good image processing and computer vision   basis. he must also master programming in matlab and/or c++. academic context comsee is a computer vision research team based at pascal institute, a   joint research unit of cnrs (french nat?l research council), ubp   (blaise pascal university), and ifma (french institute of mechanics).   moreover, several comsee members are linked to the universit?   d?auvergne. comsee is part of the pascal institute/ispr group, which   focuses research in perception, robotics and computer vision. it is   located near clermont-ferrand in the central region of france. comsee has been prospecting for computer vision and photogrammetry   based solutions for 3d localisation, 3d reconstruction, sensor   calibration and real-time tracking for about 20 years. it has been   involved in the creation of several companies : poseidon, dxo, ... comsee focuses on two main research paradigms : image matching and 3d   reconstruction and is structured as follow: ?	visual geometry and 3d reconstruction ; ?	image matching, recognition and tracking. more details at http://www.ip.univ-bpclermont.fr conditions: the monthly net salary is approximately 1650? for a 3-year contract. the phd would ideally start in september/october 2015. contact: o. ait-aider  (institut pascal cnrs / universit? blaise pascal   clermont ferrand ii) t?l. +334 73 40 55 67 email : omar.ait-aider at univ-bpclermont.fr to obtain further information or to apply (providing a cv) -- "

234,2015,post-doctoral position at inria-crisam 	on gait analysis using walker apparatus," gait analysis is classically used by the medical community for functional and cognitive assessment of frail people. indeed gait alteration may reflect compensations for underlying pathology such as musculoskeletal disorders, vision alteration, neurological disorders such as parkinson and depression. in addition this alteration  may lead to falls which is a major leading cause of accident for people over 65. the demographic evolution makes this last  problem particularly important both for the individuals, but also for the entire society through its financial consequence. this advocate for a carefully and regular evaluation of the gait in particular for aging persons. this evaluation  is usually performed at hospital or during a doctor's visit, and in addition to be time consuming for the medical staff, cannot be done frequently enough for an early detection of a risk factor. continuous gait monitoring may constitute an efficient solution for a timely detection of gait alteration. for that purpose the hephaistos team has developed several devices such as instrumented walkers and canes allowing a  continuous measurement of gait parameters such as speed, number and  length of the steps and support forces but also of other new indicators (maneuvering area, trajectory deviation, ....) that have been shown to be very sensitive to gait alteration. furthermore our first results have shown that the measurement of gait parameters with these devices are usually quite accurate, while not requiring expensive systems. the aim of this postdoctoral position is to process the data generated by the team's devices in order to produce significant risk indicators. especially we are interested in developing a two steps methodology for risk assessment: 1- taking into account measurement uncertainties for gait quantification, thereby producing minimal interval for the indicators values that are guaranteed to include the ground truth, with the additional advantage that the width of the interval characterizes the quality of the measurement 2- perform a statistical analysis of the interval gait parameters for providing an interpretation of gait alteration and therefore identifying possible risks step 1 is performed using the mathematical method of interval analysis for which the hephaistos project have an expertise. data for step 2 will be obtained with the help of several medical teams with which the team has a long standing collaboration. serious competences in c programming and in statistical analysis is required. knowledge in medical procedure, biomechanics and signal processing would be appreciated, while an intensive formation on interval analysis will be provided by the team. for more information on the team see :  http://www.inria.fr/equipes/hephaistos <http://www.inria.fr/equipes/hephaistos> duration : 24 months starting autumn 2016. location : inria, hephaistos team, sophia antipolis, france. scientific supervisors : jean pierre merlet, odile pourtallier. for more information please contact odile pourtallier  (odile.pourtallier at free.fr <mailto:odile.pourtallier at free.fr>) by november 6th 2015."

269,2016,phd position in control of parallel 	robots," ""please forward this email to anyone who might be interested"" the lirmm at cnrs/university of montpellier is looking for graduate students interested in pursuing a phd degree in control and robotics with focus on control of parallel robots. description : parallel kinematic manipulators (pkms) have gained an increased  popularity in the last few decades. this interest has been stimulated by  the significant advantages of pkms compared to their traditional serial  counterparts, with respect to some specific industrial tasks requiring  high accelerations and accuracy. however, to fully exploit their  potential and to get the most of their capabilities, a long path is  still to be covered. in addition to mechanical design, calibration and  optimization of the structure, efficient control development plays an  essential role in improving the overall performance of pkms. however, most of the proposed control schemes in the literature are  often inspired from those of their serial counterparts, while neglecting  friction, actuators dynamics, transmission and motor drivers. the objective of this thesis is to look for the necessary tools to  improve the performance of parallel robots, in terms of precision,  motion speed and robustness. in this framework, we wish to propose a new formulation that allows  estimating and compensating errors coming from: -motor drivers, -actuators dynamics, -transmission system, -friction in the articulations. indeed, it should be a technological feat, which relies on recent  advances in automatic control and robotics. the study will start first  on one articulation of the robot, and then it will be generalized to the  case of the whole robot with the complete chain including motor drivers,  actuators, transmission system and the articulations. however, such a solution will not be trivial, since pkms are known for  their highly nonlinear dynamics which increases considerably when  operating at high accelerations, often leading to mechanical vibrations.  moreover, uncertainties are abundant in such systems due to model  simplifications, the wear of the components of the robot and the  variations of the environment. furthermore, their highly coupled dynamics, singularities and actuation  redundancy in some mechanisms give rise to very complex and challenging  control issues. consequently, the developed control schemes should take  into account all the previously mentioned issues and challenges. to this end, estimation and identification techniques (online and  offline) will be proposed in this study and integrated in a new global  formulation relying on adaptive control strategies. the proposed formulation will be first validated in numerical  simulations, then through real-time experiments on different available  pkms at lirmm. two case studies will be performed: non-redundant pkms (case of veloce  and adept quattro robots), and the redundantly actuated pkms (case of r4  and arrow robots). real-time experiments will be performed in different operating  conditions (nominal case, external disturbances rejection, robustness  towards uncertainties, change of operating conditions, etc) to show the  effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution in terms of global  performances of the parallel robot.    *requirement:*candidates should have a master degree (or equivalent) in  automatic control, robotics, or a closely related area, preferably with  a focus in automatic control and robotics. he/she is expected to have  good skills in control and robotics as well as in simulation and  programming (matlab/simulink, c/c++, etc). a background in parallel  robotics would be appreciated. *thesis beginning:*1^st of october 2016 for 3 years. *laboratory: *lirmm umr cnrs/university of montpellier, france. *how to apply?: *interested applicants should send a motivation letter,  a detailed cv, current transcript and recommendation letters to: ahmed.chemori at lirmm.fr and through the doctoral school i2s website (link ?phd proposals?) https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.edi2s.univ-2dmontp2.fr_&d=dqifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=mzasgxozmn5gx9rhctumwllmtgthnuygvs9ot7pje5o&s=ejbf2ee0gqdbgmmbqzr3nacwlct0epnwcsiauvtau5c&e=  kind regards a. chemori --  -------------------------------------- dr. ahmed chemori cnrs researcher universit?

273,2016,phd position in medical microrobotics  at lirmm (montpellier) and icube (strasbourg) france," applications are invited for a fully funded phd position (36 months) in  medical microrobotics in france. students with a strong background in mechanical engineering, compliant  mechanisms or microrobotics are encouraged to apply. topic ------- microrobotic systems for diagnosis and gastrointestinal therapies context ----------- since the appearance of the first endoscopic capsules for the  observation of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, a lot of work has been  done to increase the performance of these devices by giving them new  functions [1].  initially as mere inert capsules, these systems have  evolved gradually into real micro-robots with new functions as  locomotion and in situ intervention (drug delivery, biopsies, sample  extraction, etc.). however, the fabricated prototypes are generally  designed by miniaturization of mechanical principles initially thought  for conventional-size robots, which leads to major difficulties in  clinical operations. the recent development of 3d printing processes  using biocompatible materials and progresses in microrobotics and  micro-mechanisms based on flexible structures allow considering the  development of new approaches for the design of micro-robots transiting  through or staying inside the digestive tract with a major objective:  clinical application on a large scale and at low cost. for this purpose, the lirmm (laboratoire d'informatique, de robotique et  de micro?lectronique de montpellier - umr cnrs 5506) and icube  (laboratoire des sciences de l'ing?nieur, de l'informatique et de  l'imagerie - umr 7357) propose this phd position. these two laboratories  are recognized in the field of medical robotics and in the design of  robots, and offer this thesis in the labex cami  context (computer  assisted medical interventions). the aim is to develop a new generation  of microrobots exploiting the possibilities of biocompatible additive  manufacturing (3d printing) to design and implement micro-robots based  on flexible structures for applications in diagnostic and  gastrointestinal therapies, designed in partnership with the laboratory  timc-imag (techniques de l?ing?nierie m?dicale et de la complexit? ?  informatique, math?matiques et applications de grenoble, umr cnrs 5525). ph.d. objectives ---------------------- the objectives are to study and develop new robotic solutions at the  centimeter scale to propose devices with mobility capabilities, in order  to perform motion in the gi tract, and also to perform tasks such as  delivery of active substance, sample collection, and more generally to  contribute to the diagnostic and treatment of digestive pathologies. technological developments will be mainly based on the use of 3d  printing techniques for the manufacturing of biocompatible flexible  structures. current additive manufacturing techniques offer a large  freedom in the design and they constitute a solid basis for building  miniaturized devices with a bottom-up strategy, instead of a classical  top-down process. in this latter case, robotic solutions are elaborated  from well-known solutions at the macro scale. this can be a strong  limitation with assembly or friction issues that are not encountered  with solutions developed initially at the micro scale, on which we will  rely. in other words, we intend to use design principles issued from  micro and nano robotics to develop at a meso scale robotic devices that  can be exploited in the gi tract environment and that are able to  generate sufficient forces and displacements. for this ph.d. work, the student will benefit from the expertise of the  advisors in the field of compliant mechanisms, robotic systems,  microrobotics and in medical robotics. a whole set of experimental  facilities will be available within the dexter group at lirmm and avr  group at icube, as well as apparatuses from timc-imag. the three groups  also have close interactions with the medical environment. work program -------------------- the ph.d. work will take place in montpellier and strasbourg, two very  attractive cities, at lirmm and icube, two outstanding research  environments for the development of such medical microrobots. mobility  during the 3-year program will be needed in order to develop the ph.d.  project. in a general way, the foreseen work program can be described in the  following way: -          state of art on gi robotics -          study of the gi environment and selection of relevant tasks  for the applicative context -          assessment of biocompatible 3d printing processes -          elaboration of mechanical concepts based on compliant  mechanisms for the design of meso robots -          design, integration and evaluation of new flexible structures -          design, integration and evaluation of new microrobots -          experimental assessment in lab conditions -          preclinical trials, depending on the performances obtained  during lab evaluation the time spent in montpellier and strasbourg will be defined after  discussion with the ph.d. applicant, the goal being to optimize the  interactions with scientific experts and the use of experimental  facilities on the two sites. during the 3 years,  montpellier-strasbourg-montpellier or strasbourg-montpellier sequences  can for instance be considered. applicant profile ---------------------- the ph.d. applicant needs to have a mechanical engineering or  mechatronics background. he/she will hold a m.sc.in one of these fields,  or an equivalent diploma (engineer degree). skills in the medical  robotics/compliant mechanisms would be a plus. expected beginning -------------------------- beginning of the ph.d. thesis is expected in october 2016 for 36 months. advisors ------------ yassine haddab professor, university of montpellier lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477 161 rue ada, f-34095 montpellier cedex 5 france e-mail: yassine.haddab at lirmm.fr t?l. : +33 4 67 41 85 57 pierre renaud professor, insa strasbourg avr ?

 robotics is a rapidly evolving technology that allows for fast, low-risk  and low-cost tasks with a worldwide market of over 80 billion dollars  over the next few years. in particular, aerial robots, also known as  drones, provide a breakthrough to easily image and access all sorts of  terrains and situations and are useful for instance in surveillance and  forensics, emergency industrial inspection or a search and rescue  operation. a major difficulty for their global acceptance is the  difficulty for controlling their flight and interacting with them. indeed, aerial robots are generally operated using a (central) ground  station which is not compatible with the time pressure required by  emergency conditions, for instance when rescuing a person out of reach with the ground station. this phd project  aims at concealing such obstacles and construct an aerial robot which is  able to be autonomously and interactively controlled by simple human  gestures, for instance that of a rescuer. the main scientific challenges  are (i) to embed in the aerial robot all the electronics for the visual  system from the retina to the control signals to the propellers, (ii) to  very quickly recognize a variety of simple gestures on-board using a  neuromimetic architecture and (iii) to make the robot react in real time  to these gestures. as such, this project is inter-disciplinary by  positively combining advanced algorithms from event-based bio-inspired  computer vision and the latest technology in aerial robots. first, the project will aim at using bio-inspired methods to remove the  three mentioned obstacles. biological vision, contrary to conventional  processing, is not using frame-based information or clock-based  processing. indeed, it is computationally more efficient to take full  advantage of the dynamic nature of the visual scene: biological vision  is relying on neurones working in parallel networks and coding the  spatio-temporal information of the visual scene into asynchronous spike  trains. thus, biological visual processing, starting at the retina, is  totally asynchronous and event-driven, and their artificial counterparts  can be efficiently modelled [1]. event-based dynamic vision provide a  novel and efficient way for encoding light and its temporal variations  by registering and transmitting only the changes when they occur.  neuromorphic vision sensors mimic biological visual processing by using  an array of interconnected neurons to simulate the neural network [2]  and such systems can output dynamic decision making signals which can be  used to steer the propellers. second, we intend to detect simple human gestures based on the semaphore  system which is based on characteristic hand and body movements. these  are well adapted as they are simple, fast and efficient to categorize  thanks to their unique spatio-temporal signatures. previous authors used  computationally intensive frame-based visual processing and classifiers  to recognize patterns made with different face poses and hand gestures  onboard uavs [3]. differently, we hypothesize that dynamic human  gestures contain characteristic statistics with respect to still images  such that they are more easy to categorize within these neuromimetic  systems. as a consequence, the present phd proposal will provide with a method to  control an aerial robot with hand and body gesture using a bio-inspired  asynchronous electronic architecture. we will first design the  neuromorphic retina able to generate spikes adapted to gesture vision.  then, the phd project will focus on signal processing methods to  identify human presence and associate efficiently series of spikes to  its body movement. the electronic architecture processing the visual  signals will be strongly inspired by the architecture of neural  networks, and therefore will be preferably using clock-less  microcontrollers (such as the verilog-based tiempo clockless 16-bit  microcontroller) or at least an asynchronous computational unit (such as  fpga). an algorithm will then transform the perceived body movement into  control order to the aerial robot. last but not least, experimental  studies will be conducted using the mocap vicon system inside the  marseilles? flying arena.

280,2016,post-doc position on collective  response in self-organizing systems available at utc (compiegne - france)," ?apologies for multiple postings? a fully-funded 1 year (renewable for at least another year, contingent on performance) postdoc position in self-organizing systems is available at the laboratory of excellence (labex) at the universit? de technologie de compi?gne (utc) in france (www.utc.fr/labexms2t). the successful candidate will work with dr. eliseo ferrante on exciting topics at the interface between self-organized artificial life, robotics systems and statistical physics. the postdoc position is expected to start in fall 2016 or later (flexible) and is open until filled. project description: our lab considers self-organizing systems from a unique interdisciplinary point of view that combines artificial life, engineering, statistical physics, and biology.  we study how various biological and technological components can collectively achieve complex dynamics using only simple rules and no centralized control. examples include bird flocks, insect and robot swarms, and bacteria colonies coordinating to achieve collective motion. one of the fundamental challenges of self-organizing systems is the integration of local and global dynamics. while individual components are mainly linked to local sensing and actuation, coherent global responses are required for the organism or group to perform and survive collectively. in order to achieve this collective response, those systems need to have correlations in at least some of their individual state variables that scale up with the system?s size. various processes may provide mechanisms for this coherent collective response. for example, the addition of few long-range interactions is enough to produce integrated dynamics in small-world networks. furthermore, in absence of long-range interactions, systems in a critical state (between order and disorder) naturally display long-range correlations that can achieve coherent system-level dynamics. finally, there could also be other types of interaction modes responsible for reaching coherent collective response. the project undertaken by the candidate will be focused on understanding self-organizing system that must simultaneously manage local and organism-level dynamics. the candidate will study systems in which a collective response is generated at the collective scale, as a function of stimuli that are exerted at the local scale. the candidate will explore whether this property is already present in existing self-organization mechanisms, and potentially develop novel models in which collective response is generated by the interplay between three different mechanisms: small-world topologies, criticality, and self-organization. potential applications include collective exploration and surveillance with technological devices such as drones, which will take advantage of this collective response in order to have a fast reaction to a discovered resource. the candidate will be using tools such as multi-agent simulations and mathematical models to study collective systems with different types of interaction patterns. she or he will focus on scenarios where global and local dynamics needs to be integrated in a group of agents, in order to achieve specific collective goals involving collective response, such as: mapping an unknown environment, achieving collective response to the discovery of a feature in the environment, performing dynamic agent re-allocation in the environment, etc ? in order to do so, the candidate will focus on analyzing the interplay between the different mechanisms able to achieve collective response, in order to find which configuration is best for each scenario. candidate?s profile: the candidate must have earned a doctorate degree in computer science, statistical physics, complex systems, or relevant disciplines, and must be self-motivated and able to work autonomously. the candidate is expected to be proficient in programming languages such as python, java, c++ and to have solid knowledge of scientific software packages such as matlab, r, mathematica. the candidates must have experience with large-scale multi-agent simulations, and familiarity with mathematical modeling of collective systems using several techniques (odes, mean field approximations, chemical reaction networks, fokker-planck equations, langevin equations, etc ?) will definitely be a plus. candidates with an interdisciplinary background that are interested in questions at the interface between science and engineering will be highly preferred. fluent english (written and spoken) is required, and only applications in english will be accepted. above all, the applicants must be motivated, autonomous, and able to learn quickly and work effectively on challenging research problems. documents required to apply: to apply, you can send the following documents to eliseo.ferrante at hds.utc.fr: - curriculum vitae - at least two references and/or recommendation letters - a statement of research experience and interests - publication record stating impact factor (if present) and number of citations for any informal enquiry about the eligibility conditions, as well as for more details about the position, please contact eliseo ferrante <eliseo.ferrante at hds.utc.fr>. --  eliseo ferrante, phd labex ms2t junior research chair joint laboratory heudiasyc labex ms2t umr cnrs 7253 universit?

 has an open postdoc position for developing active perception schemes  for mobile robots, and for combining them with the concurrent execution  of tasks of interest (e.g., navigation, exploration, coverage, and so on). ********************************************* note: i will be attending iros. please contact me if you would like to  meet me there. ********************************************* *context and roles* one of the main problems in mobile robotics is the need of estimating  some states/parameters of interest during motion exploiting the sensors  available onboard. typical examples are localization for ground robots,  pose/attitude estimation for flying robots, online calibration of sensor  parameters, or more complex tasks such as slam. however, these estimation problems are often nonlinear and, therefore,  the observability properties of the state/parameters to be estimated  strongly depend on the particular trajectory followed by the robot. some  trajectories may be unobservable, while other ones may result in high  information gain. in recent years, an increasing interest has arisen around the problem of  devising active perception schemes in which the robot motion is  optimized offline/online in order to maximize some observability  criterion related to the states/parameters to be estimated. in this context, the postdoc is then expected to address the conception  and implementation of active perception algorithms for quadrotor uavs  with onboard cameras. the main focus will be about the *online*  generation of optimal trajectories with maximum information gain for  addressing, e.g., localization and scene reconstruction. concurrent execution of other tasks of interest may also be considered,  thus creating the need of trading off between task execution and  information gathering during the robot motion. finally, extensions to a multi-uav case will also be part of the  activities, in which the multi-uav group needs to cooperatively estimate  some global property of interest in an optimized (perception-aware) way. *skills* the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in control  and/or state estimation theory and, possibly, experience with state  estimation for mobile robotics (ground/flying), and with trajectory  optimization techniques. a ph.d. degree in robotics, computer science, applied mathematics (or  related fields) is required. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink, with the quadrotor uav platform, and with  camera-based navigation algorithms are also a plus. scientific  curiosity, large autonomy and ability to work independently are also  expected. finally, a good level of written/spoken english is also required in  order to interact with

299,2016,"doctoral research position on 	""governing automated vehicle behavior"""," phd thesis proposal  general information: ? title : governing automated vehicle behavior  ? contract duration: 36 months  ? funding: avethics project (anr - french national research agency) & vedecom* institute   ? application: as soon as possible  ? phd supervisor : raja chatila - raja.chatila at isir.upmc.fr  ? vedecom supervisor :  ebru dogan  - ebru.dogan at vedecom.fr  ? academic partner: institute for intelligent systems and robotics (isir), universit? pierre et marie curie (upmc)  ? industrial partners: renault s. a. & psa peugeot citro?n  ? location: universit? pierre et marie curie (upmc), paris and vedecom* institute , versailles. deadline: november 30, 2016 (please note that an fcfs policy will be followed in the evaluation of the applications until a suitable candidate is appointed.) description: a. context:  automated vehicles (avs) will soon share roads and streets with other users and vehicles ? automated or not ? and in crowded urban environment, with pedestrians, cyclists and other mobile objects. the av decision-making system will have to cope not only with actual traffic conditions, abide by traffic rules, stop on traffic lights, yield to traffic with higher priority, etc. but also avoid obstacles and correctly react in unusual and unpredicted situations, such as pedestrians suddenly crossing the street or other vehicles abnormal motions. when all vehicles will be automated and connected, such situations will tend to decrease, but deployment of avs will probably be gradual, and there will remain pedestrians on the streets. it is therefore of prime importance that the avs is equipped with a decision-making system that enables it to manage its driving at all times and in all situations.  this thesis proposal is in the framework of the anr avethics project, ?ethics policy for automated vehicle?, granted to vedecom institute, the institute of intelligent systems and robotics (isir) at university pierre and marie curie, and university paris-sorbonne. the focus is the ethical conduct of an automated vehicle during its driving in usual conditions, but also when facing situations wherein it must take decisions involving ethical choices (greenblatt, 2016), i.e., decisions that all have negative consequences, but that have nevertheless to be made.  b. objective: the objective of the current thesis to conduct research in robotics and artificial intelligence to design and validate a decision-making system, which will be used as a research tool to model the properties of an artificial ethics in order to test the interactions of an av with other road users in dilemma situations.  there are several moral theories that try to explain or to guide human decisions (deontic, utilitarian, casuistic ?) that could be applied as such to machine decisions. one of the first tasks of the candidate will be to study moral theories and to become acquainted with their philosophical foundations. simultaneously, literature on machine ethics will be also studied (allen 2006, chauvier 2014), specifically in the context of autonomous vehicles (lin 2015, bonnefon 2015). an artificial moral agent implementing different moral theories as well as casuistic and pragmatic approaches will be then developed and implemented (mclaren 2006). driving is typically in uncertain and evolving conditions. not only perception and interpretation of situations is uncertain, but also actions are not deterministic and their consequences cannot be predicted exactly due for example to vehicle motion (e.g., skidding) or other vehicle reactions. research will therefore explore and implement uncertain representations, e.g., bayesian representations and bayesian networks (ferreira 2013) and decision-making approaches, e.g., markov processes or game theory, in the context of multi-agent systems, in which each agent have partial information, non-identical and maybe conflicting goals and interests, as well as different computational capacities. this is a major objective of the thesis.  the work will also include the development of a simulation environment to study scenarios and situations for characterizing different ethical approaches, and enabling to study human reactions as well. furthermore, the work will investigate how the system could be able to adapt its behavior by learning from user decisions, instead of merely applying its own policy. the simulation environment will have to embed this capacity. research will be performed to propose an appropriate learning approach from acquired data on the situation and driver decisions (droniou 2014, sutton 1998). this will also enable to provide a comparative study on human and artificial ethics.  seeked profile: ? master in computer science or electrical engineering,  ? background in robotics, perception, probabilistic and bayesian reasoning ? strong programming skills (c, c++, other).  ? experience in serious games and simulation environments is a plus.  ?

347,2017,postdoc position in robotics at  university college london," postdoc position in robotics at university college london (job reference: 1685656) available for immediate start, initially funded until 31 march 2021 application deadline: 20th november 2017 this post is part of a large collaborative project called ?assistive devices for empowering disabled people through robotic technologies? (adapt). the adapt project is funded by the european interreg va fce program and comprises a total of 16 partners equally distributed between france and the united kingdom. ageing societies and chronic disabilities are irrevocable trends in the eu, which usually result in a loss of autonomy and a breakdown of social relations. in some cases, the use of an electrical powered wheelchair (epw) is the only way to provide autonomy and improve social inclusion. at present many people with complex disabilities face increased isolation due to loss of independent mobility because of difficulties of getting assessed for provision of an epw and the availability of an appropriate epw. therefore, this project has 4 key aims: 1.        develop a smart electrically powered wheelchair; 2.        develop a corresponding powered wheelchair training simulator; 3.        train healthcare professionals in this novel assistive technology; 4.        pave the way towards production and market adoption of the developed assistive technology. as such the consortium includes a range of universities/research institutes; hospitals; companies and charities. the postdoc at ucl will be managed by dr tom carlson and will be housed in the aspire centre for rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__ucl.ac.uk_aspire-2dcreate&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=cb1kpxdszvi_pppjwz3b7q54esu2wbqql3ztobytl64&s=tvuxd5p-h20gfmugyiyttj4ljiap5_qz0w1cmn7dtdu&e=). aspire create is physically located on the ucl stanmore campus and is integrated into the royal national orthopaedic hospital and the aspire charity, which gives us unprecedented access to clinicians, patients and assistive technology providers. ucl?s main responsibilities within the project are in the development and testing of the shared control algorithms that will provide appropriate amounts of assistance to the user when driving the epw in typical activities of daily living. the postdoc will contribute to the co-design of both the wheelchair and the corresponding simulator platform, in close collaboration with several consortium partners. full job description: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__goo.gl_dmn7jy&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=cb1kpxdszvi_pppjwz3b7q54esu2wbqql3ztobytl64&s=nccggkkxqjzpq_xx4azx3soaks1gioqq23zumu9q36y&e= apply here: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__goo.gl_9scnuu&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=cb1kpxdszvi_pppjwz3b7q54esu2wbqql3ztobytl64&s=lbmb7vz2lsry-uj8isxdkdaka7r9j2eu29hn31c_bic&e= informal enquiries can be made to tom carlson <t.carlson at ucl.ac.uk<mailto:t.carlson at ucl.ac.uk>> ? dr tom carlson, phd dic meng acgi mieee miet senior lecturer aspire create - centre for rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology programme director rehabilitation engineering and assistive technologies msc educational lead stanmore campus +44 (0) 208 385 3048 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.ucl.ac.uk_aspire-2dcreate&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=cb1kpxdszvi_pppjwz3b7q54esu2wbqql3ztobytl64&s=qg-glq3tf-caqegwhmpjw5tiwuk7-_xxfrezx-wn7se&e= https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__people.itcarlson.com_tom&d=dwigaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=cb1kpxdszvi_pppjwz3b7q54esu2wbqql3ztobytl64&s=4zfcwnr5zso3qmg4gk4vp6k2isbttclojue0s5zaejw&e= @uclaspirecreate t.carlson at ucl.ac.uk<mailto:t.carlson at ucl.ac.uk>"

366,2018,"internship in machine learning for  optimization of human-robot movements in inria, france"," the larsen team in inria nancy (france) is offering a research internship position for master students. **** internship at master level title: machine learning for optimization of human-robot movements with energetic/ergonomics criteria duration: 6 months, starting asap ****** the goal of this internship is to combine state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to whole-body controllers of simulated humanoid robots and human-like characters, to optimize the movement with respect to ergonomics and energetic criteria. the internship is realized in the context of the european project andy [1], focused on human-robot collaboration. one of our objectives is to provide the robot with the capabilities to optimize its actions so as to take into account the ergonomics comfort. for doing so, a human operator will be equipped with inertial and force sensors (xsens mvn link suit and force plates) to record some demonstrations of pick & place whole-body motions. the motions will be replayed in a simulation and control framework, using a whole-body qp controller, where the human is approximated by a rigid body model using a urdf description, as we did in [2]. the whole-body controller will be parameterized, as well as the trajectories for the pick & place task, computed from the human demonstrations. the objective is to apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to optimize some parameters of the controller and/or of the motion trajectories, with respect to energetic and ergonomics criteria. a possible solution will be to take on a reinforcement learning approach, where a measure of performance of the whole movement is computed and used to optimize the parameters, as we did in [3] for humanoid motions. particular attention will be devoted to try data-efficient algorithms that enable a fast optimization in few trials, developed in the context of the resibots project [4]. the student will develop software modules interfacing our machine library limbo [5] with our control framework based on opensot [6]. the next step will be to test his/her optimization module online with the icub robot, helping a real human in the pick & place task by optimizing the location of the object to be picked from the robot (handover). active collaboration with the researchers in the andy and the resibots projects will be required.  demonstrations with the icub robot handling an object to a human wearing the xsens suit are expected at the end of the internship. the intern will be supervised by serena ivaldi in close interaction with jean-baptiste mouret and pauline maurice.  references: [1] andy project: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__andy-2dproject.eu_&d=dwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=e21hpxgcfcvbbhlwc9obqjvcscaoez_fa_p6d6bxra8&s=2yxnel-opcp-qb2pzhyhwjfat1kow7oytdslboz3p7c&e= [2] otani, k.; bouyarmane, k.; ivaldi, s.

369,2018,phd opening in visual/force control for  advanced robotic manipulation," the rainbow team at inria/irisa rennes, france https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=drpudrtuu9dc0numex6tplttszdgmqrywqtzwyu1zgq&e= has an opening for a phd position in visual/force control for advanced  robotic manipulation. *********** description of the activities *********** force and vision are the typical sensing modalities for realizing modern  robot manipulating systems. force/torque sensing allows fine control of  the forces exchanged between the robot and the environment (including  humans), and is a key technology in the recent soft robotics revolution.  vision (in all its forms, e.g., mono/stereo, 2d/3d) is needed for  perceiving the external world and coping with all the unavoidable  uncertainties of unstructured environments. research of force/torque  control and in visual control (also known as visual servoing) for robot  manipulator has spanned the last decades, albeit quite often these two  sensing modalities (and associated control problems) are addressed  separately. this is probably due to the very different characteristics  of the two sensors: torque/force sensors usually provide very high rate  measurements that require little processing/interpretation. vision  sensors, on the other hand, run at much slower rates and their  measurements require high levels of processing for being usable by  control algorithms. the goal of this phd is to study how to optimally combine vision and  force/torque sensing into a common control framework for advanced  manipulation tasks with a robot manipulator. in particular, our goal is  to extend the well-known sensor-based control framework for robot  manipulators (of which the classical visual servoing is a typical  example) to directly take into account force/torque sensing. possible  research directions are: - how to express and model robotics tasks directly in the sensor space:  most works on vision/force coupling exploit vision for reconstructing  the 3d pose of an object of interest (to be grasped), and then apply  standard force/torque control algorithms for motion and interaction  control. however, as typical in visual servoing, 3d pose reconstruction  is often not needed, and one could directly reason in the sensor space  without the explicit need of solving an inverse (3d reconstruction)  problem which is poorly robust to miscalibrations - the very different update rates of vision and force sensing (up to two  orders of magnitude) motivates the development of advanced  estimation/control schemes for coping (at runtime) with this  discrepancy. for instance, model-based filtering can be used for  interpolating at high rates between consecutive vision measurements, and  predictive schemes (as in mpc) can be used for anticipating the  robot/environment behavior when no measurement is available; - when approaching an object to be grasped, the end-effector will  typically occlude part of the object and prevent the extraction of the  needed visual features. indeed, in many cases the last  approaching/grasping phase is executed blindly without using the vision  sensor. assuming partial, but not total, occlusions, one can still  exploit modern model-based tracking schemes for still recovering a good  estimation of the object pose (possibly exploiting a known object  model). this would allow exploiting vision during all phases, and not  only when far from the object; the control algorithms developed during the ph.d. will be validated on  the franka robot available in our lab. this robot has 7 dofs and is  equipped with torque sensing in all its joints. *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink and/or relevant computer vision library (e.g.,  visp, opencv, pcl) are a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the rainbow team https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=drpudrtuu9dc0numex6tplttszdgmqrywqtzwyu1zgq&e= is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experiences in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision and sensor-based control for robotics  applications. the facilities available in the group include three 6-dof  industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof torque-controlled backdrivable arm,  a 7-dof torque-controlled robot arm (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile  robot, two humanoid robots (romeo and pepper), a fleet of quadrotor  uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with vicon. the candidates will be under the supervision of *dr. francois chaumette* https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_team_francois-2dchaumette_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=lpcomabzdwvqwwqbsafyq3x6zmpkbyizswrv8xsruho&e= and *dr. paolo robuffo giordano*. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_team_prg_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=z7bwqsv7vqux4xea0hrt_23xjqtr4nekwhysh9z1bzm&e= and will work in close collaboration with other members of the rainbow  group involved in the project. the rainbow group is part of the inria/irisa lab that spreads its  activities in 30 research teams working in computer science, signal  processing, and control. it involves about 650 people, including 120  professors and assistant professors, 100 full-time researchers, 80  administrative staff, and 250 phd students. ***********  how to apply  *********** interested candidates are requested to apply via this form https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_appl-2dform-2dphd-2dvisual-2dforce_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=icpszmtx8oqhjdlihbfhsmezqxxv3z1j6ryutrobmcq&e= the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__team.inria.fr_rainbow_team_prg_&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=z7bwqsv7vqux4xea0hrt_23xjqtr4nekwhysh9z1bzm&e= youtube: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_channel_ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-2d9zalju8w&d=dwicaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=5cpfwwz4gnuuoqohmjlbwyywokei5_5n8u-yjrgeqjm&s=u5suhg0xfpiufelqubvm77xbspi8uvygjzibassm0eg&e="

372,2018,"phd position in humanoid robotics at  lirmm, france"," we are looking for applicants to a phd position in humanoid robotics at lirmm, france. duration: 3 years starting date: october 1st, 2018 topic ----- in the current state of the art, motions realized on humanoid robots usually alternate between fixed contacts with the environment. fixed contacts have been sufficient to describe a number of scenarios, including walking. yet, they also impose strong restrictions on the range of motions that humanoid robots can realize. imagine humans climbing a steep staircase: when a ramp is available, they are likely to keep a hand sliding on it, increasing their overall stability with the ability to squeeze the ramp whenever necessary. far from this, in current stair climbing experiments, robots are grasping the ramp at predefined locations (see e.g. references [1] and [2] below), resulting in slow and overly conservative (hence power-consuming) motions. the reason for this conservative behavior is that non-fixed contact ""modes"" (for instance, sliding contacts) are not handled by state-of-the-art humanoid controllers today. the goal of the successful phd candidate will be to develop this new capability. in this endeavor, s/he will design new contact models and control software that will be tested on the hrp-4 humanoid robot used in our lab (see e.g. our team's youtube channel [4]). about the team -------------- the idh team [4] is part of the cnrs?um montpellier laboratory of computer science, robotics, and microelectronics (lirmm), montpellier, france. it works in close collaboration with the cnrs?aist joint robotics laboratory (jrl) located in tsukuba, japan, with which frequent exchanges of people, know-how and software take place. as part of the team, the candidate will be surrounded by a group with strong expertise in humanoid motion planning and control, where we value both theoretical developments and their application to the real robot. our team collaborates closely with airbus group as part of the comanoid project [5]. in the course of the phd, the candidate will therefore interact with practical scenarios expected to have a strong return in the years to come. profile ------- master in robotics, computer science or automation with strong programming skills (c++ or python preferred). linux fluency is a plus. application ----------- https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__scaron.info_phd-2doffer-2ded-2d2018_&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=j9tnsjpd6alczwoevc5vzci3a3ylcn78a4pyvziq9jk&e= references ---------- [1] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal.archives-2douvertes.fr_hal-2d01203507_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=mvo2ogmj-dc4o1eeybvc50ffbej9ely9qxotpdu8r-c&e= [2] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal-2dlirmm.ccsd.cnrs.fr_lirmm-2d01256512_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=k2ynxpyy69ygu6wv0-zxcdjctbqgu70zqa1oi_gpfq0&e= [3] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__hal.archives-2douvertes.fr_hal-2d01276934_document&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=mz53ngod4kztdxl-ii1a3cjrocqpne8edbrh2bbqh0y&e= [4] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_channel_ucycrcw6xsxytsxon6btbf8w&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=hzezsmiwrd7yldec5p3net6zf3ifwuny-trd_npr4to&e= [5] https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__comanoid.cnrs.fr&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=_eywlc3m5k9uqnyk3phnvg41p6by47434tg9nbfcoya&e= best regards, --  st?phane caron cnrs?um lirmm, montpellier, france https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__scaron.info&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=qoskjfwuuwhzffkqxweghk_rk3j3bhigyrb4gcvdg4g&s=xrhzqnnifbbqz8qv31shhvxdjijrpdfbuxhfuvygbio&e="
373,2018,"phd position on state estimation for  robotics at inria, france"," we are looking for applicants for a phd position in robotics at inria nancy. topic ----- autonomy of robots often requires an internal representation of the current state of both the robot and his environment. many state estimation techniques rely on a probabilistic representation wherein a probability distribution over the state space is recursively computed based on some observations and a model of the evolution of the system. there are several techniques (kalman filters [1], hmm [2], particles filters [3]) that have been applied in robotics for various problems ranging from robot state estimation [4,5] to mapping the environment [6,7]. the aim of this phd project is to advance the state of the art of filtering techniques in robotics along two principal dimensions. the first objective is to find way to propagate information between the different kind of filters: how to do efficient bayesian inference with distinct distribution representations? an approach of this question could typically come from approximation techniques such as sampling or moment matching. the second objective will be to combine those model-based filtering techniques with machine learning. indeed the models are never complete or correct and several techniques require approximations to become tractable. there are therefore systematic errors that could potentially be corrected by model-less learning techniques such as deep neural networks. finally, the emphasis will be laid on the experimentation and validation methodologies. the algorithms developed should be demonstrated and applied to concrete robotics problems, for instance in the context of the smart apartment. this experimental setup is a small flat equipped with a wide range of sensors from pressure tiles on the ground to rgb-d cameras. we dispose of several mobile robots from turtlebots to a pepper robot as well as a motion capture system that can provide ground truth information for the pose of the robots and of humans. right now, we can separately locate the robot, build a map of the obstacles, locate sound sources, locate people and assess their current activity, etc. the aim is to build an integrated representation of this all and to leverage the synergies to improve their respective estimates.

380,2018,"phd position in medical microrobotics  at lirmm, montpellier, france"," applications are invited for a fully funded phd position (36 months) in medical microrobotics in france.  students with a strong background in mechatronics are encouraged to apply. skills in instrumentation, signal processing, and/or medical robotics would be appreciated.  topic  -------  artificial palpation elastography for increased perception in transoral cancer surgery of the base of the tongue.  context  -----------  in the context of cancer treatment, minimally invasive robotic surgery (mirs) allows the resection of tumours that are difficult to access using conventional techniques, with an increase in the quality of resection and functional consequences. in particular, for cancer of the base of the tongue, surgery is the preferred primary treatment. for tumours affecting rigid organs such as bones, preoperative imaging (ct or mri), combined in particular with intraoperative navigation, enables the tumour and its borders to be reliably located during the operation. this is not the case with soft tissues such as the tongue. indeed, the soft and largely extensible tissues constituting this organ lead to an imprecise recognition of the limits of the tumours during the operation with a risk of insufficient or incomplete resection or, on the contrary, the removal of healthy tissues.  for this type of tumor, traditional resection methods (without robotic assistance) are performed using an open surgical approach. palpation with the finger of the base of the tongue is performed by the surgeon in order to identify, intraoperatively, the contours of the tumour and thus guide the resection procedure. indeed, this procedure allows the surgery to establish a link between the mapping obtained by tactile sensation and the results of preoperative imaging. this identification is possible thanks to the difference in the elastic properties of tumour tissues and healthy tissues.  in mirs, the oral canal is blocked by the introduced robotic instruments and by the endoscope which allows a visualization of the intervention site. intraoperative identification of the tumour by direct palpation of the finger (as done in open surgery) is then impossible without removing the instruments (thus temporary stop of the surgery in progress) and any tactile sensation is lost.  the lirmm (laboratoire d'informatique, de robotique et de micro?lectronique de montpellier - umr cnrs 5506) and the chu (centre hospitalier universitaire) of montpellier are joining forces for the proposed work which consists in designing, fabricating and operating an artificial palpation device for medical applications. the thesis is funded by isite muse (montpellier university of excellence). https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__muse.edu.umontpellier.fr_en_muse-2di-2dsite_&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=zln84wupopcadqxdvru7to1urcz_hbc4opme5xzxoaq&s=tl1m66ehqhveyfnyidojzpkuem156jar-iitlx2bgua&e=  ph.d. objectives  ----------------------  the objective of this thesis is to develop a device allowing the palpation of the base of the tongue to identify the contours of a tumour intraoperatively, which can be used for robotic surgery and therefore in an obstructed environment. the proposed concept, very different from existing devices, uses principles derived from microtechnologies to obtain a miniaturized device for mapping the tongue base. the development of such an innovative device represents a real international positioning opportunity that can be extended to other palpation applications in confined medical environments.  to carry out his work, the phd student will rely on the skills of the management team (lirmm dexter team) in the fields of design, implementation and control of systems for medical applications and on interactions with hospital practitioners (montpellier university hospital).  work program  --------------------  the work planned within the framework of this phd thesis could be structured around the following guidelines:  - state of the art on artificial palpation ;  - study of the characteristics of healthy and tumoral tissues;  - proposal of concepts for artificial probing devices ;  - design, implementation and evaluation of new devices;  - tests on artificial benches;  - preclinical tests based on laboratory performance.  the phd student will be located at the lirmm (montpellier - france) but will occasionally have to move to the medical faculty of the university of montpellier and to the montpellier university hospital. they are all close to each other.  applicant profile  ----------------------  according to the characteristics of this phd proposal, the applicant must have a background in mechatronics or a related field. he must hold a master's degree or equivalent (engineering degree). skills in instrumentation, signal processing, and/or medical robotics would be appreciated.  expected beginning  --------------------------  september 2018. duration: 36 months.  advisors  ------------  yassine haddab  professor at universit? de montpellier  laboratoire lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477  161 rue ada, 34095 montpellier cedex 5  france  e-mail: yassine.haddab at lirmm.fr  phone: +33 4 67 41 85 57  nabil zemiti  associate professor at universit? de montpellier  laboratoire lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477  161 rue ada, 34095 montpellier cedex 5  france  e-mail: nabil.zemiti at lirmm.fr  phone: +33 4 67 41 86 78  --  ------------------------------------------------------  yassine haddab  professor at universit? de montpellier  laboratoire lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477  161 rue ada, 34095 montpellier cedex 5  france  e-mail : yassine.haddab at lirmm.fr  phone : +33 4 67 41 85 57 "
381,2018,ph.d. position in 3d modeling and robot  perception," a ph.d. position is available as part of the scanbot project. the ph.d. is co-funded by onera, the french national aerospace research center, and by the hauts-de-france region. the prospective student wil be enrolled in the doctoral program of the university of picardie jules verne in amiens, and he/she will spend his/her time at onera, palasieau, and at the mis laboratory, amiens, france. description of the project: 3d digital technologies play a key role in our society today, and they are essential for preserving, promoting and understanding the historical and cultural heritage. in particular, 3d laser scanners (lidars) allow to analyze the surface of complex structures (e.g. the facade of a building) and to extract detailed information about its geometry and appearance. the laser measurements are traditionally processed offline to build a 3d virtual model for the end-user. however, in spite of recent technological advances, the 3d reconstruction pipeline (from point-data collection to 3d modeling) is far from being automatic and it requires a high degree of human intervention, which has a strong impact on the costs and on the length of a measurement campaign. other challenging issues are the generation of homogeneous and complete models, the presence of occlusions, and the exposure to accident risk for the personnel.  the goal of the scanbot project is to develop and to experimentally validate new 3d mapping, cooperative control and active perception algorithms for mobile robotic platforms, to make the data collection and processing phases of the 3d reconstruction pipeline, fully automatic. the coordination of robotic platforms, called ? scanbots ?, will be instrumental in speeding up the acquisition process and improving the accuracy and uniformity of the 3d model, while ensuring the safety of the personnel. heterogeneous vehicles and sensors (robots equipped with lidars on the ground, and drones with on-board cameras aloft) will provide complementary information about the environment to be reconstructed. the measurements gathered by each robot will be used to navigate autonomously and safely, and also to generate a 3d local model of the environment. the ensemble of the local maps will be automatically registered and merged into a global coherent model.   keywords:  lasergrammetry; computer vision; mobile robots; active perception; cooperative control profile of the ideal candidate: we are seeking an outstanding and enthusiastic candidate with a strong background in computer vision, robot perception, control theory and optimization. excellent programming skills (c, c++, matlab) and a good knowledge of the most common computer vision libraries and software tools for point cloud visualization and processing, are also requested. applicants should have a msc in computer engineering, electrical engineering, control engineering or closely related fields. application procedure:  the candidates should send their cv, list of grades, research experience, language skills and motivation letter as a single pdf to dr. fabio morbidi, fabio.morbidi at u-picardie.fr (please use [phd position onera/upjv] as subject line of your email). the selected candidates will be invited for an interview via skype or telephone before june 15, 2018. questions on the position can be addressed to dr. fabio morbidi (fabio.morbidi at u-picardie.fr) or to dr. julien moras (julien.moras at onera.fr). if you are planning to attend icra?18 in brisbane, a job interview can be arranged with dr. fabio morbidi. expected start date:  october 1st, 2018 about onera: the ? office national d'etudes et de recherches aerospatiales ?

383,2018,phd position - coordinated control of a  mobile manipulator carrying out dynamical work in natural environments,"  =========== in the framework of the research project ?innovative systems and services for transport and production? idex/i-site cap 20-25 (challenge 2 ? theme : agrotechnologies) and the labex imobs3, tscf-irstea and institut pascal are offering a phd position for highly motivated candidates interested in completing a phd thesis on robotics. ============ mobile manipulators are of great interest to perform tedious and repetitive tasks on large areas. several studies have set the first principles to synchronize the different degrees of freedom provided by the mobile platform and the robotic arm, as well as to control the nonholonomic motions of the mobile base. however, most of these studies focus on the displacements of the robot on rigid soils within structured and controlled environments, and consider quite often quasi-static work, i.e. the manipulator arm operates when the mobile base is stopped. however, for productivity purposes, in particular in agriculture, it becomes necessary to consider the coordination and a close coupling of the movements of the robot including in dynamical conditions, in particular in the case where the manipulation is used to  carry and displace the monitoring and intervention tools (e.g. for diseases detection, spraying) with respect to a flexible target. this thesis deals with mobile manipulators operating in natural environments. it will consider the development of strategies enabling the accurate control of the treatment body, carried by the manipulator arm, relatively to flexible target plants, and this in a dynamical context. first, the aim will be to ensure the accurate control of the 3d position/orientation of the sensors mounted on the robot end-effector while synchronizing the motions of the mobile base at low speed. second, the thesis will develop perception and control algorithms for the mobile manipulator taking into account the specific phenomena and perturbations encountered in off-road conditions. deep learning techniques could be evaluated in that way. the objective will be next to couple the motions of the base and the manipulator to ensure the efficiency of the task at potentially high speed, requiring to manage in particular the 3d motions (pitch, roll) inherent to displacements in off-road conditions. this thesis will be based on several work already initiated on this thematic and will extend the principles of adaptive and predictive controls to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the work in an agricultural context. ============ requirements ============ a master degree in computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, mechatronics or other related areas. strong background in mathematics and programming, specially in c++. excellent oral and written communication skills in english. =============== desired experience =============== previous experience and knowledge in one or more of the following areas: robotics, machine learning, control theory and computer vision. previous experience on programming in ros (robot operating system) software and using linux operating system. previous experience on programming with opencv and pcl libraries. =========== contacts =========== the candidates should send their candidatures via email at youcef.mezouar at sigma-clermont.fr and christophe.cariou at irstea.fr, including: (1) their cvs, (2) motivation letter, (3) transcripts of previous university degrees (unofficial are enough now), (4) previous research publications (if existing) and (5) contact information of 2 or 3 people who could serve as references. ========================== youcef mezouar sigma clermont institut pascal umr 6602 cnrs/uca/sigma clermont campus des c?zeaux-cs 20265 63178 aubi?re cedex france tel : +33(0) 473 288 065 ==========================="

395,2018,"fully funded phd position in long-range,  long-endurance autonomy for challenging underwater environments at  noc/university of southampton/ifremer"," titre du projet en anglais: long-range, long-endurance autonomy for challenging underwater environments titre du projet en fran?ais: syst?mes autonomes de longue port?e et longue endurance en milieux sous-marins difficiles description du projet le groupe s'occupant des syst?mes autonomes et robotiques marins (marine autonomous and robotic systems group (mars)) du centre national d'oc?anographie anglais (national oceanography centre (noc)), ainsi que le groupe de robotique de l'ifremer et l'universit? de southampton (uos) recherchent un excellent candidat pour entreprendre un doctorat (phd) ? l'universit? de southampton dans le cadre d'un programme commun franco-britannique. le programme consiste en une bourse de doctorat de trois ans avec un financement complet qui est d?sormais r?serv? que aux candidats de nationalit? fran?aise ou anglaise et a pour but le d?veloppement de syst?mes autonomes pour une longue port?e et longue endurance en milieux sous-marins difficiles. plus pr?cis?ment, l'objectif est de d?velopper des algorithmes temps r?els embarqu?s pour un contr?le intelligent et une planification de mission adaptative de plateformes robotiques sous-marines (par exemple, maximiser la livraison des donn?es compte tenu des observations effectu?es pendant la mission), tout en gardant une bonne perception et connaissance de la situation de l?environnement et bien entendu, en r?alisant les objectifs de la mission. une attention particuli?re sera accord?e ? la compr?hension de la susceptibilit? de l'approche aux contraintes auxquelles fait face le robot en milieux r?els, telles que les perturbations environnementales et/ou les mesures de capteurs conflictuelles (erreurs & aberrations), ainsi que les limitations de ressources (autonomie ?nerg?tique limit?e). le candidat id?al aura une solide formation universitaire en informatique, en math?matiques ou en automatique ou dans une discipline ?troitement li?e. le candidat recherch? a de solides comp?tences en math?matiques, en particulier en ce qui concerne les probabilit?s. la connaissance des techniques d'intelligence artificielle, de robotique et la ma?trise d'un langage de programmation sont hautement souhaitables. en raison de la nature du financement, l'?tudiant doit ?tre un citoyen britannique ou fran?ais. motivations et m?thodologie: les robots sous-marins oc?aniques naviguent dans les environnements les plus extr?mes de la plan?te. dans ces environnements hautement dynamiques, les missions traditionnelles sont pr?-planifi?es et donc limitatives car plut?t d??tre bases sur les observations, elles sont bas?es sur des attentes qui parfois ne correspondent pas a la r?alit? terrain. par cons?quent, la capacit? d'un robot ? raisonner sur les donn?es des capteurs et ? adapter son plan est donc cruciale pour optimiser la r?alisation des objectifs de la mission. cette th?se vise donc ? d?velopper des techniques de planification en temps r?el en situation incertaine, pour permettre ? un robot de r?agir aux opportunit?s qui se pr?sentent en cours d'une mission, par exemple en r?alisant une lev?e ? haute r?solution d?un objet ou zone d?int?r?t apr?s une d?tection pr?alable a basse r?solution. la th?se est une th?ses appliqu?e qui pr?voit une impl?mentation sur des plates-formes robotiques r?elles. le projet mod?lisera et garantira donc la conformit? de l'approche aux contraintes op?rationnelles et logistiques r?elles, prenant en compte l'autonomie ?nerg?tique, la bande de communication limit?e, la n?cessit? de surveiller la plateforme par des op?rateurs ainsi que la gestion des responsabilit?s. par exemple en apportant des modifications incr?mentales au plan en temps r?el, en utilisant des techniques telles que la r?paration de plans (plan repair) ainsi que des biblioth?ques de plans pr?d?finis, l'ensemble des plans et comportements robotiques r?sultants devraient rester born?s et pr?visibles tout en permettant au robot de rester flexible face aux opportunit?s ?mergentes et aux ressources disponibles. l'?tudiant aura acc?s aux ressources des deux plus grands instituts de recherche oc?anographique du monde, qui comprennent parmi les plus grandes flottes de syst?mes autonomes

] ) is recruiting research associates to  perform cutting-edge research on artificial intelligence reasoning,  planning and decision-making in autonomous systems for public spaces,  surveillance and security. the positions represent a unique opportunity  to work with truly world leading academics and fellow research  associates (a total of 20 members) on frontier research for ai and  robotics in complex environments.  the research group focused on model, intelligent agent and  decision-making activities are designed to lead advancement in ai  technologies and key robotics that will create a step change in current  practice of assistant robots in public space and drones in complex  situations for surveillance and assessment.  multi-robot and human-robot teaming  the research team concerns multi-robot and human-robot teaming for joint  activities leading to the problems of social navigation and interaction,  multi-robots coordination, human-robot interaction and situation  awareness representing the following key scientific challenges:  1)position 1: social navigation and interaction where the social norms  should be considered. classical algorithms for navigation and  interaction should be revisited to consider the welfare being of humans  when the robot navigates around or interacts with them.  a)theoretical required skills: social norms, decision-theoretic  approaches (mdp, pomdp), planning and navigation  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, c/c++, java.  2)position 2: path planning in public space should consider a very large  map where the representation is huge and algorithms becomes  time-consuming and not reactive. also, there are varieties of topologies  to manage leading to new challenges for path planning and navigation  algorithms.  a)theoretical required skills: search algorithms, distributed  algorithms, decision-theoretic approaches (mdp, pomdp), planning  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, c/c++, java.  3)position 3: active perception as decision-making problem where a  system maintains a belief on the hypothesis and should disambiguate the  situation by acting on sensor to change his beliefs and to improve his  situation awareness. a new epistemic model using probabilistic models  should be developed with efficient algorithms evaluated on robots for  surveillance and security.  a)theoretical required skills: information theory, decision-theoretic  approaches (pomdp), bayesian belief propagation.  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, c/c++, java.  4)position 4: muti-robot coordination for assistance in public space  where we develop a system for multiple robots with multiple kb,  distributed reasoning with different knowledge and information that  should plan and act in a coordinated way. this problem consists in  developing distributed reasoning and decision-making with or without  communication to develop a joint coordinated activity of a fleet of robot.  a)theoretical required skills: multi-agent systems, decentralized  decision-theoretic (dec-pomdp, nd-pomdp), multi-agent planning.  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, simulation tools, c/c++, java.  5)position 5: coordination in a competitive environment where the system  should adapt its behavior to an adversary element. we propose to study a  problem of a stochastic game to compute the policy of an agent according  to unknown but estimated policies of an adversary. this theoretical  framework should be evaluated in the context of trajectory computation  of a robot while avoiding to be detected by the other robots. the formal  framework should be generalized to a team of robots against another  a)theoretical required skills: game-theoretic approaches (posg),  augmented models, distributed solving problems.  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, simulation tools, c/c++, java.  6 )position 6 : coordination between autonomous and semi-autonomous  systems. in this problem we re-visit all coordination techniques of  coordination where most of them assume that plans of the other systems  are known. in this post-doc position we are interested in coordinating  cooperative systems where some of them are semi-autonomous and the human  is in their control loop where he can change their behavior.  a)theoretical required skills: multi-agent systems, decentralized  decision-theoretic (dec-pomdp, nd-pomdp), multi-agent planning.  b)required programming skills: ros, open cv, simulation tools, c/c++, java.  we will investigate all these research directions in the context of  robotic projects funded by different french government entities. most of  these positions are developed in cooperation with french academic and  industrial partners.  candidates should have a phd in computer science and/or robotics. strong  competences in mobile robotics, ia techniques: reasoning, planning and  learning in multi-agent settings are required, with hands on experience  with implementation of algorithms on real robots. candidates will work  as part of a large team of researchers and we expect excellent  communication and teamwork

404,2018,phd fellowship in computer science -  virtual embodied assistant for remote and isolated caregivers," *phd fellowship* french version below subject: modelling a humanoid virtual assistant for remote and isolated caregivers. supervisor: ronan querrec co-supervisors: elisabetta bevacqua enib - brest national school of engineering lab-sticc - laboratory in the field of information, communication and knowledge science keywords: embodied conversational agents, multimodal data analysis and generation, medical procedures and assistance data, system trustworthiness. the phd project is part of the anr vr-mars project that aims at implementing an assistance system designed for emergency care support in remote and isolated sites. the system will be based on virtual reality (rv) and embodied conversational agents (ecas). we hypothesize that these two technologies improve the situation understanding and the coordination of all the stakeholders: a remote caregiver and the referent expert centre. the vr-mars case study will focus on space medicine and the simulation of emergency care during a manned mission on mars. the geographic distance will be doubled by the temporal isolation, due to the communication latency between the caregiver (on mars) and the expert centre (on earth). the goal of this phd is to design, implement and evaluate the virtual assistant.  the virtual assistant must be able to support the caregiver to go through a medical procedure and to help them to keep the stress level under control. it must also transmit orders from the expert centre to the remote medical team imposing its authority if necessary. the phd is organized around 4 main tasks: 1. state of the art: firstly, a thorough study of the state of the art will be fundamental to define, on the one hand, how humans help others to manage their level of stress and, on the other hand, how they give orders. 2. multimodal data pre-processing: some experimentation are being currently conducted in order to tests eca's features. we want to evaluate medical emergency situations (such as severe acute appendicitis or leg fracture) involving functionalities considered as dedicated to the eca, but carried either by caregivers or by elementary cognitive supports. the aim is to collect data that will help us to conceptualize the functionalities of the eca and that will provide us with examples of the multimodal behaviours that the agent should be able to show. 3. computational modelling and implementation in an embodied conversational agent: this step will require to integrate the knowledge acquired during the first two steps to propose and implement a model of the virtual assistant. 4. evaluation: the model will be evaluated through experiments conducted in collaboration with the other partners of the project. the phd is fully funded during 3 years as part of the anr vr-mars project. the work will be realized at the european centre for virtual reality (cerv), a very well-known laboratory, specialized in autonomous behaviour modelling and human/system interaction. more precisely, the thesis will be developed within the lab-sticc. *the candidate* the phd candidate should have a master's degree completed in computer science, applied mathematics. knowledge of multimodal data processing and multimodal behaviour generation are considered as a major asset. french language is not required but very appreciated. *application* the application files should contain the following documents: - a detailed curriculum, - a description of the academic background and a copy of academic records and most recent diploma, - a cover letter describing why the applicant wishes to participate in this project and his/her research's adequacy with the proposed topics -

is looking for a phd candidate in *reactive trajectory planning methods  for formation control and localization of multi-robot system* *********** context *********** the main basic problems when addressing decentralized (and sensor-based)  formation control for multiple robots are two: formation control and  relative localization. formation control is the problem of devising  control strategies for attaining some desired geometric arrangement in  space (e.g., a target shape). relative localization is the problem of  estimating/recovering the robot relative poses from the available  onboard sensor measurements (typically, distances or bearing angles).  once one is able to solve these two problems, much more complex  tasks/missions become possible (e.g., exploration, patrolling, coverage,  but also cooperative manipulation). the localization and formation control problems are intimately related:  any formation controller needs availability of the robot relative poses  which must be estimated/recovered from the sensor measurements. however,  the localization itself is a nonlinear estimation problem and,  therefore, the motion/trajectory followed by the robots (i.e., the  action imposed by the formation controller) has a strong impact in the  performance/accuracy/convergence rate of the relative pose estimation.  this tight loop between formation control and estimation (which is the  multi-robot version of the classical ?action/perception loop? in  robotics) is both scientifically very interesting and practically very  relevant (one needs to properly solve it for having the hope of  deploying multi-robot teams in real-world conditions). the vast majority of formation control and localization algorithms are  essentially local: they aim at obtaining the best control  actions/estimations ?right now? given the current state of the robot  group, but they cannot reason about the future. however, since several  years many modern control approaches for non-trivial robotics  applications stress the importance of a proper trajectory planning for  accomplishing a task in more robust and effective ways. indeed,  (reactive) trajectory planning allows to reason about the future  consequences of local actions, to better take into account complex  constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance, limited actuation, sensing  constraints), and, finally, to attain optimality w.r.t. criteria of  interest (e.g., time, energy, control effort). while reactive trajectory planning approaches (or model predictive  control ? mpc) have gained a lot of ground in the robotics field (one  example for all, humanoid robotics), their use in the context of  multi-robot formation control and localization is still quite limited.  on the other hand, the complexity of controlling a multi-robot group in  harsh environments (sensing constraints, limited  actuation/communication/processing power, obstacle and self-collision  avoidance, need to estimate some group properties at runtime) would  clearly call for the use of modern reactive trajectory planning  approaches in order to better deal with the problems of formation  control and localization in unstructured environments. this is not a  trivial issue, since one has to address all the typical  issues/sensing/communication constraints of multi-robots, as well as  comply with the requirements of decentralization and scalability (i.e.,  ideally, each robot should be able to plan its own future trajectory by  only exploiting sensed/communicated information from the closest neighbors). *********** phd topic *********** in this context, the goal of this phd thesis is to close this gap and  develop novel reactive trajectory planning algorithms tailored to the  multi-robot case. these algorithms should allow for an effective  resolution of the ?multi-robot perception/action loop?, i.e., formation  control and localization, in realistic settings: limited sensing (e.g.,  fov, range), limited actuation, limited communication, presence of  obstacles. global objectives (e.g., exploration/patrolling) or  optimality criteria (e.g., energy consumption, localization accuracy)  should also be taken into account. the phd activities will naturally leverage the strong internal  competences on multi-robot control/optimal estimation and on trajectory  planning, and will be performed in cooperation with the chorale team at  inria sophia antipolis (in particular p. salaris as co-supervisor). the  devised algorithms will be first tested in a simulation environment and  then implemented and validated on the several quadrotor uavs available  in the team (in an indoor motion capture arena). *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink and/or relevant computer vision library (e.g.,  visp, opencv, pcl) are a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently

420,2019,"fully-funded phd position in robotic  interactive manipulation tasks at laas-cnrs, france"," dear colleague, funded phd studentship available at laas-cnrs (toulouse, france). **project title** planning and control of interactive manipulation tasks  with a robot **short description** even if robots are more and more present in our environment, the  development of robots capable of interacting intuitively, naturally and  safely with humans to exchange objects, perform tasks in contact or help  people with disabilities in their daily tasks, is not yet a reality. the building of models and tools allowing a robot to plan and then  execute complex handling tasks appears necessary. beyond the movement,  these models must describe the task in order to control the dynamics of  the object manipulated by the robot, i.e. the relationship that links  masses, forces, gravity, stiffness, friction, position and their  derivatives. the movement is no longer described by the position to be  reached, but by a set of functions. this allows to define properties  that these functions must verify to ensure the stability of the control.  in this context, a planner can produce a precise description of the  task. this description provides for the temporal evolution of the  quantities to be controlled and monitored. the controller can then  provide more accurate information on the progress of the task, allowing  the planner to control the execution of the task and re-plan it if  necessary. by better describing the behaviour of the human partner, this approach  should also make it possible to better define and anticipate human  action. the more accurate description of the prediction of human  behaviour should also allow for more accurate and rapid detection of  deviations between the prediction and the execution of a collaborative  task, which gives hope for better attention to humans through continuous  adjustments of the plan. in this context, the objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the  possibility of building robots based on time models. more precisely, the  development of these models and then associated controllers, will be  used to demonstrate the possibility of defining a reactive planner  capable of adapting the plan according, firstly, to the feedback from  the controllers and, secondly, to the evolution of the environment and  in particular to the human interacting with the robot. **more information** https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.adum.fr_as_ed_voirproposition.pl-3flangue-3den-26site-3dedsys-26matricule-5fprop-3d24407&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=zztuup3utiwtfrhe3odvyngymzufqpixa-bbjq7v7l0&s=ygfxg4pn7vzpnuzen9iztt6njqufpkat6nw45qdm34q&e= https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__homepages.laas.fr_daniel_nweb_node_26-23english-2520version&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=zztuup3utiwtfrhe3odvyngymzufqpixa-bbjq7v7l0&s=q8tnkwueuqpfmc9psrr6ij0_sbhujifmn6hovtxrpng&e= **who we are** the robotics and interactions (ris) team in the robotics department of  laas-cnrs (toulouse, france), one of the largest laboratories of cnrs,  the flagship (and largest) center of scientific research in france.  laas-cnrs was founded in 1968 and it counts around 700 people, with more  than 100 tenured researchers and as many university professors. research  at laas-cnrs spans robotics, optimization, control, telecommunications,  and nano-systems. the robotics department at laas-cnrs counts more than  100 people and ? being founded at the end of the 70?s ? it is supposedly  one of the largest and oldest robotic research department in france.  laas-cnrs robotics department has made world-class contributions in  artificial intelligence, planning, perception, humanoids, and aerial  robot design and control. **context** the funding is a 3 years academic scholarship of edsys doctoral school.  the subject is also related to industrial, french and european research  projects that the team is carrying out. **how to apply** to submit an application please send an email with a cv to  daniel.sidobre at laas.fr before the deadline: april 30, 2019 daniel sidobre. -- daniel sidobre  ?ma?tre de conf?rences ? l'universit? toulouse iii - paul sabatier  ?chercheur au laas-cnrs https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__homepages.laas.fr_daniel&d=dwidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=zztuup3utiwtfrhe3odvyngymzufqpixa-bbjq7v7l0&s=9uvmd_epzjk8jrinfv4qeltq_wxs-xxqjjzdk4ckxi0&e="

424,2019,phd opening in reactive trajectory  planning methods for formation control and localization of multi-robot  system," the rainbow team at inria/irisa rennes, france

is looking for a phd candidate in *reactive trajectory planning methods  for formation control and localization of multi-robot system* *********** context *********** the main basic problems when addressing decentralized (and sensor-based)  formation control for multiple robots are two: formation control and  relative localization. formation control is the problem of devising  control strategies for attaining some desired geometric arrangement in  space (e.g., a target shape). relative localization is the problem of  estimating/recovering the robot relative poses from the available  onboard sensor measurements (typically, distances or bearing angles).  once one is able to solve these two problems, much more complex  tasks/missions become possible (e.g., exploration, patrolling, coverage,  but also cooperative manipulation). the localization and formation control problems are intimately related:  any formation controller needs availability of the robot relative poses  which must be estimated/recovered from the sensor measurements. however,  the localization itself is a nonlinear estimation problem and,  therefore, the motion/trajectory followed by the robots (i.e., the  action imposed by the formation controller) has a strong impact in the  performance/accuracy/convergence rate of the relative pose estimation.  this tight loop between formation control and estimation (which is the  multi-robot version of the classical ?action/perception loop? in  robotics) is both scientifically very interesting and practically very  relevant (one needs to properly solve it for having the hope of  deploying multi-robot teams in real-world conditions). the vast majority of formation control and localization algorithms are  essentially local: they aim at obtaining the best control  actions/estimations ?right now? given the current state of the robot  group, but they cannot reason about the future. however, since several  years many modern control approaches for non-trivial robotics  applications stress the importance of a proper trajectory planning for  accomplishing a task in more robust and effective ways. indeed,  (reactive) trajectory planning allows to reason about the future  consequences of local actions, to better take into account complex  constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance, limited actuation, sensing  constraints), and, finally, to attain optimality w.r.t. criteria of  interest (e.g., time, energy, control effort). while reactive trajectory planning approaches (or model predictive  control ? mpc) have gained a lot of ground in the robotics field (one  example for all, humanoid robotics), their use in the context of  multi-robot formation control and localization is still quite limited.  on the other hand, the complexity of controlling a multi-robot group in  harsh environments (sensing constraints, limited  actuation/communication/processing power, obstacle and self-collision  avoidance, need to estimate some group properties at runtime) would  clearly call for the use of modern reactive trajectory planning  approaches in order to better deal with the problems of formation  control and localization in unstructured environments. this is not a  trivial issue, since one has to address all the typical  sensing/communication constraints of multi-robots, as well as comply  with the requirements of decentralization and scalability (i.e.,  ideally, each robot should be able to plan its own future trajectory by  only exploiting sensed/communicated information from the closest neighbors). *********** phd topic *********** in this context, the goal of this phd thesis is to close this gap and  develop novel reactive trajectory planning algorithms tailored to the  multi-robot case. these algorithms should allow for an effective  resolution of the ?multi-robot perception/action loop?, i.e., formation  control and localization, in realistic settings: limited sensing (e.g.,  fov, range), limited actuation, limited communication, presence of  obstacles. global objectives (e.g., exploration/patrolling) or  optimality criteria (e.g., energy consumption, localization accuracy)  should also be taken into account. the phd activities will naturally leverage the strong internal  competences on multi-robot control/optimal estimation and on trajectory  planning, and will be performed in cooperation with the chorale team at  inria sophia antipolis (in particular p. salaris as co-supervisor). the  devised algorithms will be first tested in a simulation environment and  then implemented and validated on the several quadrotor uavs available  in the team (in an indoor motion capture arena). *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and experimental points of view. therefore, a strong passion (and attitude) towards the *more theoretical  and algorithmic side* of robotics (nonlinear control, estimation,  planning) is expected. *********** salary *********** the

425,2019,open post-doc position: verification  and validation of intelligent and autonomous systems," open post-doc position: verification and validation of intelligent and autonomous systems dependability of autonomous and intelligent systems becomes of particular concern when they are used in critical applications because ai systems, which are specifically based on machine learning techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, notably challenge classical approaches for system verification and validation.  the use of large databases for training, which may include all sorts of bias or unverified labels, or the use of black-box components, is clearly problematic as these databases and components are not verified. in an ethically aligned design process, it is important to understand if, and how, the learning system?s behavior and output will carry or even possibly enhance data bias, and if there are design choices that were made which result in decisions that do not comply with the values that the system should be designed to respect. in addition, the whole process of adjusting the parameters of learning systems, as well as designing their architecture, induces several difficulties for formal verification techniques, as well as for qualifying system robustness and predictability because autonomous systems behavior is influenced by the learning data and by operation conditions which were not explicitly considered at design stage. the objective of the research work to be carried out during this project is to investigate how to design verification and validation methods and techniques that can be applied to intelligent and autonomous systems with learning abilities in order to qualify their behavior, evaluate their robustness and guarantee their compliance with values they are supposed to respect.  theses verification methods could lead to design, testing and certification procedures. several use cases can serve as context for the developments.  post-doc funded for 18 months in the framework of the european project ai4eu. availability: asap. requirements: phd in computer science on topics related to verification/validation, dependability, ai, robotics, learning.  place of work: institute of intelligent systems and robotics (isir), sorbonne universit?, campus pierre & marie curie - 4, place jussieu 75005 paris, france.  please send cv and motivation letter to raja.chatila at sorbonne-universite.fr <mailto:raja.chatila at sorbonne-universite.fr> mentioning [pd vvais] in the subject line. _________________________________________ prof. raja chatila  raja.chatila at sorbonne-universite.fr isir - institute of intelligent systems and robotics sorbonne universit? - campus pierre & marie curie  4 place jussieu - b.p. 173 - pyramide-tour 55 75252 paris cedex 05 - france tel: +33 1 44 27 28 76 ___________________________________________"

448,2019,phd position in computer vision and  medical imaging," title: registration of 3d optical biopsies: application to medical imaging of  high-resolution and wide field-of-view location  ?	femto-st institute (umr 6174), as2m department ?	25000, besan?on, france duration ?	36 months (start: october, 2019) scientific context  femto-st institute (besan?on, france), develop several research activities related to surgical robotics, medical imaging, and image-guided intracorporeal interventions. in particular, we are addressing the clinical problem of performing of in-situ 3d optical biopsies, i.e. the optical analysis at the micrometer resolution of biological tissues thanks to highly efficient medical imaging without the traditional physical sampling of suspected tissues (physical biopsy). however, tissue analysis at micrometric resolution, using for example optical coherence tomography (oct) or confocal microscopy, raises the problem of the limited field of view. actually, this is the recurring dilemma of a wide field of view and micrometric resolution. to remedy this, it is necessary to perform several high-resolution 3d optical biopsies based on the micrometric motion of the imaging probe and to assemble them to reconstruct a single high-resolution biopsy over a large area.  clinical context the clinical objectives of this investigation are numerous, among them, achieving of 3d optical biopsies with micrometric resolution and wide field of view as part of the in-situ characterization of the olfactory mucosa in human subjects. the idea to find a precursor sign (earlier diagnosis) of a future neurodegenerative disease (alzheimer?s and parkinson?s disease) by studying the odor operating in its healthy and pathological states. the diagnosis is intended to be as early as possible (5 to 10 years) before the first signs of motor impairment or memory loss. in fact, it has been statistically demonstrated (post-mortem studies) that loss of smell with no apparent causes (trauma, cancer, etc.) is generally correlated with dementia (neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer).  	  consequently, the aim is to understand what is happening in vivo in the olfactory mucosa without taking a sampling process of tissues (physical biopsy), which is clinically difficult to achieve. however, the in-situ characterization of the olfactory mucosa can be carried out thanks to 3d optical biopsies approaches. scientific content  the scientific work concerns the development of accurate and robust registration methods between 3d visual information (optical biopsies). the phd student will first focus on the development of calibration methods based on local visual features (e.g., geometric type information), matching methods, computing rigid transformations as well as reconstruction and mapping all the acquired data on the same final volume. this first work will provide a basis for extending these methods in aim to use global information such as pixel/voxel intensities, wavelet coefficients or any other global image information. in addition, several parameters and external disturbances will be considered within this work such as physiological motion, ? in order to limit potential artifacts.  this work will then be extended to non-rigid registration in which the observed tissue is subjected to a global (or a local minimum) deformation resulting, for instance, from the contact between the tissue and the imaging probe.  required knowledges  ?	computer vision, (medical) imaging, robotics and applied mathematics  ?	advanced programing skills (c++, matlab, python) ?	knowledges of computer vision libraries (opencv, pcl) will be appreciated supervision team  ?	guillaume laurent (associate-prof, ensmm)    - https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__gjlaurent.github.io_&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-isabgcoo8wirtpc3ue8lea1mgwhz6z9kiuli3xh6ua&s=rcazho_e-fdrtufn2zpvjddypk8arlc_u5371frbmgo&e=  guillaume(dot)laurent(at)femto-st(dot)fr ?	brahim tamadazte (senior scientist, cnrs)    - https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__sites.google.com_site_tamadazte_home&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-isabgcoo8wirtpc3ue8lea1mgwhz6z9kiuli3xh6ua&s=gs2epmen-gyewvsgjs2cmvc3f1kiyvdeavvdnhjq7pm&e=   brahim(dot)tamadazte(at)femto-st(dot)fr application procedure interested candidates should send a cover letter, a cv and transcripts (m1 and m2 or equivalent) as a single pdf file to the supervisors before 1 september 2019. -- sent from: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__robotics-2dworldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com_&d=dwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-isabgcoo8wirtpc3ue8lea1mgwhz6z9kiuli3xh6ua&s=xaufuqwvior-b4kl8a1s1ryy7-gmghcjkkzk9b8y9dm&e= "

480,2020,full-time international phd position at  university college dublin  ireland  ," phd  ireland  : develop a framework using machine learning (ml) to identify specific features of stress response using plant phenotyping background:early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant for food security but methodologically complex. plant stress responses can be observed using non-invasive methods such as plant imaging. the use of different camera sensors such as rgb, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence enable the detection of altered plant performance in response to environmental stress. such changes include slower growth, senescent changes in the spectral reflectance and modified fluorescence responses of leaves. although these changes cannot be captured by human eye, the imaging sensors used in this project can perceive such changes very fast. to understand the early responses of plants to environmental stress, we will develop a framework of data collection, storage and curation, trait extraction and utilization of ml and classification algorithms to extract the features from plant images. plant images will be collected using imaging platforms in a controlled environment and unmanned aerial vehicles in field conditions(uavs). project:this exciting project will develop a specific framework that utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization and visualisation to identify specific features of stress response using thousands of plant images. the ph.d. student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by assoc. prof. eleni mangina from ucd- school of computer science and assist. prof. dr. snia negro (ucd- school of

a critical role in defining offspring health, both in childhood and in later life. according to the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) hypothesis, transient environmental exposures during critical periods of development (such as the pre-conceptional, fetal and early infant phases of life) can alter the health trajectory of the offspring. maternal diet is a modifiable behaviour that could play an important role in maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. novel findings from our individual birth cohort studies and the alphabet consortium highlight the potential influence of maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential during pregnancy on birth outcomes and a range of offspring childhood health outcomes. however limited data regarding the interrelationships between maternal diet and lifestyle, placental development and birth and childhood outcomes in humans exist. project: this exciting project will address this gap in the knowledge base by harnessing information on maternal diet &amp; lifestyle and pregnancy/birth/offspring outcomes using existing databases and analysis of biological samples from several birth cohort studies. the phd student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by dr catherine phillips, assistant professor and lead principal investigator for this research programme at the school of public health, physiotherapy and sports science, university college dublin. details: this is a 4-year full-time position, open to eu and non-eu candidates, with a stipend of 18,000 per annum.  qualifications: candidates should hold a bachelor's degree in nutrition, biological sciences (physiology, developmental biology, reproduction), public health or related field and have an interest in early life/fetal programming, nutrition and metabolic health. experience in pregnancy and childhood research, epigenetics or nutritional assessment techniques would be desirable.  application process: informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to dr. catherine phillips (catherine.phillips at ucd.ie). applications including a detailed cv, letter of motivation (max 2 pages, single spaced), transcripts and two letters of recommendation (to be sent directly from referee) should be sent to catherine.phillips at ucd.ieno later than march 23rd 2020. 	phd opportunity: dietary sugars / sweeteners during pregnancy and their impact on long term maternal metabolic and reproductive health background: there is significant evidence that an unhealthy diet greatly increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and predisposes offspring to metabolic dysfunction and obesity. while fat intake is typically associated with the onset of obesity and its comorbidities, there is increasing evidence linking sugar, particularly high fructose corn syrup, to the global rise in obesity rates. furthermore the detrimental effects of fructose intake during pregnancy on mother and child have been clearly outlined. despite their wide availability there is only limited information regarding their impact on maternal pregnancy outcomes, placental/fetal development and long term risk of cardio-metabolic complications in the mother. previous work from the group has demonstrated that the artificial sweetener ace-k increases insulin resistance during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. this project will investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners in combination with a high fat diet during pregnancy on maternal obesity, metabolic and reproductive health during successive pregnancies. this project will provide training in key laboratory skills ranging from rodent physiology, biochemical, cellular and molecular techniques. training in experimental design, data analysis and scientific writing will also be provided. this project would be ideal for a student with a background in a biological science (nutrition, physiology, reproduction, biochemistry) with a keen interested in nutrition and metabolic health. funding information:this is a 4-year full-time position with a stipend of e18,000 per annum. how to

new collaborative science foundation ireland (sfi) strategic partnership research programme, entitled consus, focussed on the application of precision agriculture to crop production with a particular emphasis on optimisation of agri-food production systems leading to more efficient food production with lower environmental impacts. the outcomes from this research programme will deliver a step-change in crop agronomy tools and practices, leading to enhanced global competitiveness. applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a 4-year phd studentship with the consus team researching crop nutrition and limits to yield potential. globally, major gains in crop yield and quality have been made through the application of the major plant nutrients (macronutrients) such as n, p and k in fertilizer. however, with the supply of adequate levels of these macronutrients, concentrations of micronutrients, such as zn, cu and mn, in soil and plant can drop below optimum and become yield- and quality-limiting. this is particularly the case in more intensive cropping systems with higher yields and removal of micronutrients in exported plant materials. fertilizer n is a major variable input cost to most conventional farming systems. in addition, poor use efficiency can increase the risk of loss to the wider environment, and associated impacts on water quality, air quality, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. this phd will use laboratory and field experimental approaches to develop an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat. this position will be in the ucd school of agriculture and food science

commonly associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs. in humans, most hev infections cause an acute, self-limiting hepatitis. however, severe disease can occur, particularly in pregnant women or those with pre-existing liver disease. hev infection is also associated with other disease manifestations including neurological disease, however the reason why severe disease occurs is poorly understood. currently, there are no specific treatments for hev, and there is no licenced vaccine in europe. hev is extremely challenging to propagate in cell culture, and there is no robust method to screen food products for the presence of infectious virus. this project will aim to develop in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hev, and to use these systems to investigate the biology of this virus in pigs and humans. the student will work with an interdisciplinary team at ucd, based at the veterinary sciences centre, and will have the opportunity to develop their research skills in one health and zoonotic disease. the student will collaborate with research groups at ucd, the university of birmingham and pirbright institute in the uk, and the cleveland clinic,

post doc position, please write to prof. rafael sacks, atcvsacks at technion.ac.il the design and use of technology has serious implications for society as a whole. there is increasing public concern about issues such as anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of military and surveillance technologies, and the possible impacts of automation and artificial intelligence. however, decisions about technological systems are often made without transparency or democratic oversight. engineers bear much of the responsibility for the development, construction, and maintenance of technological systems, but in whose interests do they act? engineering institutions claim to be committed to public welfare, but can engineers really balance that commitment with meeting the demands of employers and clients? there is in fact evidence to suggest that the culture of engineering education and professional practice discourages engineers from placing sufficient importance on public welfare. further research is needed in this area; this phd will address that need by exploring the relationship between engineering, professional responsibility, and public welfare. both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be used to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of engineering students and professionals in ireland, as well as the contexts in which these engineers study and work.

exhibiting new  physiological functions, biological characteristics or reconstitution  properties directly inspired from natural processes occurring in the  human organism. however, developing these drug cells necessitates  extracting a few lymphocytes from a blood sample, using fluidic chips  actuated by various physical effects. among the actuation techniques,  dielectrophoresis (dep) is largely used. it acts on neutral but  polarized cell placed on an inhomogeneous electric field [2]. the femto-st institute aims at proposing an optimization methodology to  design electrodes for fluidic chips actuated by electric fields. _objectives:_ the goal of one-year this post doctoral position is to use a topology  optimization method to design three-dimensional electrodes to generate  electric fields, in order to sort cells based on dielectrophoretic  effects. the methods for topology optimization, especially simp method  (solid isotropic material with penalization) are conceptuals tool aiming  to find an optimal structure within a limited design domain [1]. based  on material distribution, it consists to minimize an objective function  while subjected to one or several constraints. concretely, the method  combines finite element formulation and penalization power law to make  material intermediate density unattractive and therefore avoid the 0-1  problem of classical topology optimization approaches. in addition, the  method is easy to implement and commonly employed in classical  mechanical engineering. as reported, [2] explored the possibility of  applying this method to design 2d electrodes. with this aim in mind, we  target here to go further by extending the method for the design of  electrodes dedicated to active lab on chips. the originality of this  proposal lies on the development and topological design of innovative 3d  electrodes, for both actuation and sensing. to reach this objective, both scientific and technological barriers have  to be lifted. the scientific approach consists to combine (i) simp  method that leads to systematic and methodological designs by  distributing a limited amount of material and (ii) the physics of  dielectrophoresis. on the basis of pre-defined criteria in terms of  size, electrical field distribution, sensitivity, etc., the proposed  approach will lead to efficient and compact 3d electrodes. this work  will benefit from the recent development of analytical models dedicated  to compute the distribution of the electric field, and the  dielectrophoretic force and torque made in femto-st [3], [4]. in  addition to this challenging scientific aspect, the proposed methods  will be validated experimentally. doing so, this project aims to take an  important step towards the design and the fabrication of innovative  active cell-sorting devices. _references:_ [1] m. p. bendsoe and o. sigmund, ?topology optimization: theory,  methods and applications?. springer, feb. 2004.

488,2020,open postdoc position in robotic  autonomy for satellites at onera," a project, leaded by airbus defence and space, is aimed at developing a constellation of mini-satellites of earth observation satellites (optic). in this context, studies to improve the autonomy of each satellite within the constellation are planned, in order to make the overall constellation management more flexible (for instance prospective assumptions like inter satellite links for control or data transfer could be made). the main objective is to specify and develop a satellite control architecture which will allow that some activities to be performed autonomously on board instead of in the ground mission segment, like for instance create or adapt the sequence of image acquisitions from customers? requests or how to select and download recorded images to reception stations. this work will re-use concepts already put into application by onera in autonomous robotic applications (ground/aerial/naval). keywords are modularity based on mission decomposition into tasks and further refinements. existing developments based on python/ros2 seems difficult to use directly in a space application, so they should be transposed taken into account strong requirements about onboard satellite flight systems (os, language) to provide control architecture implementations. depending on the background profile of the candidate, work can be focused on control architecture or on onboard planning algorithms.  profile and skills required : robotic control architecture, robotic planning, optimization, knowledge of c/c++, real-time os post doc page (in french) <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://w3.onera.fr/formationparlarecherche/sites/w3.onera.fr.formationparlarecherche/files/pdoc-dtis-2020-05.pdf__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!57umhf3yusuivbmuhaokuac1lmpy8ymrau7nuoldqszeb9zdrbnt5s0myaqlqpqyune_5-de$ >   - eric bensana dtis/seas t?l: +33 5 62 25 29 01  email : eric.bensana at onera.fr onera - the french aerospace lab - centre de toulouse 2, avenue edouard belin - bp 74025 - 31055 toulouse cedex -- sent from: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!57umhf3yusuivbmuhaokuac1lmpy8ymrau7nuoldqszeb9zdrbnt5s0myaqlqpqyub3ee8xp$ "

490,2020,postdoc - sensor-based real-time  control of industrial robots in robotic 3d printing of concrete materials," *subject:*  a recent trend in construction is to introduce digitally based construction method such as 3d printing in order to accelerate the production rate, improve the security of workers, and provide design freedom to architects. cement-based materials 3d printing is beginning to be well documented [1-8]. among the developed techniques, extrusion-based additive manufacturing methods have been the most studied [1-5]. in this technique, the successive layers of concrete are deposited by a robot to build a complete structure. it is important to note that the success of this process is based on a competition between the material structural build-up rate and the construction rate [5,7]: the deposited material must be hard enough to support the increasing load induced by subsequently deposited layers of the ??in process? construction.  on the robotic hand, there are industrial applications where a perfect control of the final geometry of the printed workpieces is essential. some of these industrial applications require that the working tool (nozzle) has the ability to follow the contour of a prefabricated piece during printing operation with a control of the lay down speed, and then extruded shape dimensions, according to changes in the rheological behavior of the extruded material. an off-line planning of the robot system is not sufficient to meet these demands. real-time control and thus sensor integration are required.  studies and tests over the issue have led us to design a 3d printer composed of the combination of a 6-axis industrial robot designed by sta?bli robotics (load capacity of 195 kg) with a tp5 giema electric pump designed for mortar/render application (maximum pressure of 20 bar, maximum flow rate of 40 l/min) [9]. to make the system more flexible, we proposed an automatic offline programming solution of the robot 3d printer based on a combination of cad files of the workpieces to be slice into thin layers and the robodk?s offline programming tool which convert the manufacturing programs obtained (g-code) to robot programs free of singularities, axis limits and avoiding collisions. in the resulting configuration, the robot can follow a defined trajectory. to make the system more tolerant to the process, the focus of this thesis is on the real-time interaction between the deposited layers and the robot.  the objective of the proposed project is to design and evaluate a sensor interface, demonstrating the possibilities of real-time robot control within 3d printing of concrete materials. the main idea is to design a system which integrates different sensors and control algorithms to show the possibilities of moving the robot on a defined trajectory while controlling the printed geometry layer and tracking accurately local surroundings. common systems use vision sensors or laser-based system [10].  effort will be made on the practical implementation of the test platform for the experimental evaluations of the real-time interface on an industrial application case. it is important to note that the success of this process is based the ability to control the expected geometry of the concrete layers and the mechanical properties of the printed samples. subsequent geometrical control and mechanical testing (compressive, stress cycle, porosity, ...) of the final structures should be performed.  *forward schedule:* although this scientific field has been widely studied in recent years within the scientific community, we believe that the application and validation of these methods for 3d printing of concrete by industrial robots requires new contributions. this project is very transversal and multidisciplinary. we therefore believe that a training period on the different topics covered as well as on what exists in the team (prototypes, simulation control method, consequent software environment...) is necessary.  then we propose a program that alternates between scientific contributions and the implementation of prototypes or demonstrators that attest to the feasibility of the contributions exhibited.  ?	t0+3m: training period on the different topics covered as well as on what exists in the team (prototypes, simulation control method, consequent software environment...)  ?	t0+3m: bibliographic study for the scientific problem under consideration. ?	t0+6m: choices of sensors and control strategies ?	t0+9m: selection of software and hardware solutions. analyze the real-time characteristics of the control system including the sensors and the robot.  ?	t0+12m: realization of a test platform for the demonstration and evaluation of the proposed sensor robot control.  ?	t0+18m: data-fusion to achieve a real-time robot control during the 3d printing process. this project being multidisciplinary, it requires the skills and expertise of a number of researchers with whom we are already collaborating (irdl). *the project lasts 18 months and aims to host a post-doctoral student who has spent at least 18 months abroad between 1 may 2017 and the start of the project (no later than 1 december 2020).* *applicant profile* university background: phd -mechanical modeling, analysis, and simulation knowledge -robotics modelling and kinematic knowledge -skills and knowledge on data fusion techniques, and vision based control -programming skills (matlab, c++ knowledge) *laboratory: * laboratoire de g?nie civil et g?nie m?canique ea-3913 axe th?matique : etalonnage et commande des syst?mes robotis?s	lieu : rennes	 responsable d?unit?

familiarization with the current knowledge of emg signal processing and classification, as well as with clinical trials and protocols. a review of the state-of-the-art will be done on the technical and clinical fields linked to subject, including the recent works by the camin team.  the candidate will then explore, test and choose between a series of design decision for the system, such as number of channels, filters, classification techniques, signal acquisition protocols, and so on. automatic learning methods will be explored and develop. the candidate will be also advise on the experimental setup and proper equipment. this project is very user focused and a comprehensive user requirements document must be prepared. the candidate will take part in the process of obtaining approval for experiments by an ethical committee. by the end of the project period, a mature system capable of outputting useful command signals for a functional hybrid neuroprosthesis for persons with tetraplegia should be available. this will be validated through clinical trials with patients with tetraplegia.  the candidate will work with an interdisciplinary team including members from technical and clinical backgrounds. the team already has multiple emg and fes systems available, and the acquisition of new equipment is possible if needed. the candidate must also look forward to carry experimental work in the lab and in the clinical environment with real patients, always respecting the ethical aspects of the subject. ------------------- requirements background: engineering,

(2304?) gross (net) per month depending on experience.  deadline for application : applications should be sent asap for selection in oct/nov 2020 and start in january 2021.  this postdoc is funded by an anr-dga astrid project aiming at exploiting natural human arm coordination to improve human-in-the-loop robotic arm control for prosthesis application. whereas most researches in prosthesis control focusses on myoelectric strategies based on residual muscle activities, a promising alternative aims at exploiting residual movements that are far more reliable and easier to interpret than muscle signals. our preliminary results in virtual reality (mick et al., submitted) proved the efficiency of this approach, which enables subjects to grasp bottles of various positions and orientations with performance comparable to that with their true arm, whereas multiple distal joints were controlled on the basis of shoulder movement and contextual knowledge about the movement goal (ie the object to grasp). this project builds upon this initial proof of concept to develop more complex and relevant tasks for amputees, and apply these to the control of an existing robotic arm platform (reachy, mick et al 2019, 2020). in addition to applying biomimetic control principles on the open source 3d printed robotic platform reachy, the overall project involves development of coadaptation strategies between the user and the applied artificial control (couraud et al., 2018), as well as links to contextual information extraction from gaze-assisted computer vision ( gonzalez-diaz et al 2019, p?rez de san roman et al., 2017 ).  keywords : robotic arm control, human movements, artificial neural network, ai/machine learning, motor control, biomechanics.  required knowledge and background :  - strong experience and achievements in (humanoid) robotics, and/or in the field of human-robot interaction  - experience in ai / machine learning and artificial neural networks  - good programing skills (python, c#, tensor flow, keras, ..)  other requirements:  -

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies - experimental validation: the intended benchmark will consist of at  least two drones manipulating a single soft rod with the aim of imposing  a desired shape to the rod and to displace it to a desired location. the  final experiment will represent a first concrete step towards the full  grasping of an object with the system uavs+soft body. for this, we are  going to consider the following scenario: surrounding a vertical pole  with the soft body as in the following illustration *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving on the methodological and experimental  sides. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the armen team https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ls2n.fr/equipe/armen/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0dufoy6m_a$  is creating original research results in design, control and perception  in the field of autonomous robots and of the control of their  interactions with the environment. designing and controlling systems  able to address the two facets of the term environment (in the sense of  the environment in which the robot evolves or in the ecological sense of  the term) are two priority objectives of the team. the main issues  addressed concern the control of the dynamics of robotic systems and  their environment, the gain in autonomy and the minimization of the  environmental impact. the facilities available in the group include a fleet of autonomous  industrial cars, a platform for prototyping industrial-size industrial  and aerial robots, a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing  arena instrumented with qualisys motion capture system. the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0duuhzmw_-$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experience in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision, shared control, haptics and sensor-based  control for robotics applications. the facilities available in the group  include three 6-dof industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof  torque-controlled backdrivable arm, two 7-dof torque-controlled robot  arms (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a humanoid robot (pepper),  a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with  vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. s. briot* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/*briot-s/__;fg!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0dudoxznpx$  *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0duzk9lygy$  and *prof. a. chriette* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/abdelhamid*20chriette/__;jq!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0dudvejej_$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the armen and  rainbow teams involved in the project. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/manip-soft-drone-3/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0dushgxhii$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0duzk9lygy$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7nurarswt3dj55aqcwuu_jw9ckmftqr71vwaxvuvxw3hf6un6uruejz-nzyhai0dufkfblht$ "

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies -

523,2021,6 months internship position in  developmental robotics and cognitive modeling of the acquisition of  language in robots," 6 months internship position in developmental robotics and cognitive modeling of the acquisition of language in robots  context : language understanding has recently been a central topic of interest with the emergence of new applications such as new generation research algorithms (e.g., google search), conversational agents, smart homes and social human-robots (or avatars) interaction. until now, most of this research is focused on speech recognition (nlp), speech generation (phonology), grammatic rules extraction, and objects labelling. all these approaches rely mostly on language as a stream of (phonological or written) text of everyday language. although these approaches have led to fundamental advances on our understanding of human language, the semantic aspect of language has not received a strong attention yet in the field of ai. however, developmental psychology emphasizes the importance of semantics in language acquisition, as infants acquire language in a way that is meaningful to them (e.g., they learn first the words corresponding to their close environment and needs). furthermore, the language that they learn is always embedded in a social interactive context (e.g., language games). in this project, we take the stance that language is not only words and grammar, but the active transmission of meanings, through communicative gestures, intonation, gaze, etc.  objective : the objective of this project is twofold: (1) to increase our understanding of how humans develop categories of objects by providing a functional cognitive model to reproduce key properties of human learning, and (2) to show the ability of our approach to complement current methods of artificial language learning (e.g. deep learning methods) by providing a solution that does not require huge datasets of labeled data to learn communication skills. to this end, our method will exploit findings in developmental psychology to propose a new approach for ai acquisition of object categories that will bridge the gap between language processing and semantics in human-robot interaction.  internship topics:  ? multimodal acquisition of communication skills in robots  ? reinforcement learning (contextual multi-armed bandit, markov models)  ? neural networks, image processing  ? human-robot interaction  profile:  ? last year of master degree in computer science, electrical engineering or related subjects (ai is a plus).  ? programming skills in python/c++/matlab  ? interest in understanding child development through cognitive modelling  ? communication skills in scientific research  ? good academic record  starting date: april  allowance under the official standards (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/f32131__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs7kwshbt$ ).  location : the internship will take place at etis lab, neurocyber group and will be supervised by laura cohen (laura.cohen at cyu.fr). the lab is located at campus saint martin, cy cergy-paris university, cergy-pontoise, france.  how to apply : if you are interested in this position, please send your cv and cover letter to laura.cohen at cyu.fr  ---  laura cohen  ma?tre de conf?rences  etis-neurocybern?tique / iut de cergy-pontoise  [ https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs3nhn6vs$  | https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs4xpvzla$  ]  [ https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr/?signlogo__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs770iob-$  ] "

531,2021,phd opening in robust and control-aware  motion planning," the rainbow team at inria/irisa rennes, france https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-batnlzbck$  is looking for a phd candidate in the topic *robust and control-aware motion planning* *********** context *********** an effective way of dealing with the complexity of robots operating in  real (uncertain) environments is the paradigm of ?feedforward/feedback?  or ?planning/control?: in a first step a suitable nominal trajectory  (feedforward) for the robot states/controls is planned exploiting the  available information (e.g., a model of the robot and of the  environment). this step is usually executed offline and can take into  account presence of constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, limited  actuation) and optimality w.r.t. metrics of interest (e.g., time,  energy). an open-loop execution of this planned trajectory would,  however, fail in most practical cases because of the unavoidable  uncertainties affecting the information used for planning. therefore,  the planned trajectory is in practice robustly executed by making use of  a motion controller that ?closes the loop? (feedback) between planned  and actual motion, providing robustness against all the effects that  could not be considered at the planning stage. while there has been an  effort in proposing ?robust planners? or more ?global controllers?  (e.g., model predictive control (mpc)), a truly unified approach that  fully exploits the techniques of the motion planning and  control/estimation communities is still missing and the existing  state-of-the-art has several important limitations, namely (1) lack of  generality, (2) lack of computational efficiency, and (3) poor  robustness. all these shortcomings are a major limiting factor in the  autonomy and decision-making capabilities of robots operating in all  those complex scenarios (real-world conditions, non-negligible effects  of the uncertainties, fast dynamics) which are instead the typical  conditions in which future robots are expected to operate. in this context, the goal of this phd will be to contribute to the  development of a general and unified ?intrinsically-robust and  control-aware motion planning framework? for addressing the  above-mentioned issues and demonstrating the applicability of this new  framework to real robots in real-world challenging tasks. this phd position is part of a 4-year research project recently funded  by anr (the french funding agency). the project is in cooperation with  the ris team at laas-cnrs and the robotics and mechatronics group at the  univ. of twente, netherlands. *********** phd topic *********** the work will start from our previous contributions where we introduced  the notion of ?closed-loop state sensitivity? and showed how this  quantity can be used as an effective ?parametric uncertainty metric? for  generating motion plans that are intrinsically robust to variations in  the robot model parameters. the phd student is then expected to expand  on these topics along several lines and also work towards an  experimental validation on two robotic demonstrators: (1) an indoor  pick- and-place/assembly task involving a 7-dof torque-controlled and  (2) an outdoor cooperative mobile manipulation task involving an aerial  manipulator (a quadrotor uav equipped with an onboard arm) and a  skid-steering mobile robot with an onboard arm. these validations will  be done in cooperation with the other partners of the project. please find more details about the phd planned activities at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/ctrl_aware_plan/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bappog_ku$  *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must hold (or be close to the completion of) a m.sc.  degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied mathematics  (or related fields). the starting date of the position is flexible and can be delayed until  the fall 2021 should a suitable candidate be found. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/algorithmic* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving in robotics and applied math. in  particular, strong experience in some of the areas is certainly sought:  nonlinear control, optimization, and/or planning for robotics. good knowledge of c/c++ and ros is required, and familiarity with  matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-batnlzbck$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experiences in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision and sensor-based control for robotics  applications. the facilities available in the group include three 6-dof  industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof torque-controlled backdrivable arm,  two 7-dof torque-controlled robot arm (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile  robot, a humanoid robot (pepper), a fleet of quadrotor uavs and an  indoor testing arena instrumented with vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bavq45ynf$  *dr. quentin delamare* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/fr/team/quentin-delamare/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-baionkee7$  *prof. antonio franchi* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ram.eemcs.utwente.nl/about-us/staff/antonio-franchi__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-balej6b2g$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the rainbow  group involved in the project, as well as the member of the other  project partners (ris team at laas and robotics and mechatronics group  at the univ. of twente, netherlands). the rainbow group is part of the inria/irisa lab that spreads its  activities in 30 research teams working in computer science, signal  processing, and control. it involves about 650 people, including 120  professors and assistant professors, 100 full-time researchers, 80  administrative staff, and 250 phd students. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/ctrl_aware_plan/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bappog_ku$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-bavq45ynf$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-baumxdgtk$ "
