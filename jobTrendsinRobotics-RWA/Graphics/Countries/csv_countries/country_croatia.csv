the across  centre is an interdepartmental research centre at the university of zagreb, faculty of electrical engineering and computing. funded by the european fp-7 capacities ""research potential"" program, grant no. 285939, fp7-regpot-2011-1, the centre performs research in cooperative systems related to four strategic research domains: 1) cognitive and robotic systems, 2) networked embedded systems, 3) renewable energy systems, and, 4) cooperative control. 

 

details about the centre may be found at the across web site http://www.fer.unizg.hr/across and in the centre brochure http://across.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/across_brochure.pdf. 

 

we are looking for a self-motivated researchers to work in an exciting and challenging area of cooperative control and cognitive robotics. the general research topics are: 

1.       cooperative control, muiltiagent control

2.       cooperative mobile manipulation

3.       cooperative heterogeneous robotic systems

4.       robot embodiment in networked embedded environments

5.       human-robot cooperative systems

6.       robotic vision, dynamic scene analysis

 

the exact research topic of each new researcher will be chosen so as to match his/her experience aiming at maximum productivity. 

 

the job announcement is published at http://across.fer.hr/across?@=2bx77#news_63145. 

 

sincerely yours,

 

ivan petrovic
