introduction:
recently a large number of bio-inspired computational methods have been used 
(also called methods of natural computing) to solve computationally hard 
problems in many domains. these methods have proven to be successful for 
different types of problems with unknown and uncertain data where the 
traditional approaches are not so effective. it is estimated that the biological 
life that evolved during millions of years will be a fruitful source of 
inspiration for the development of new computational methods offer in the years 
to come and they will represent an important research direction in the 
artificial intelligence mainstream.
 
objective of the special issue:
from a practical perspective, an essential research direction is represented by 
the development of highly complex systems (usually agent-based) that 
intelligently solve problems of very high difficulty. we consider complex 
systems composed from a large number of components (agents) capable to make 
specialized computations in the problem space. such developments are usually 
composed of a very large number of computational components, who interact many 
times nonlinearly, forming as a whole a complex problem solving system. a 
subclass of complex systems includes the hybrid systems composed from different 
type of artificial components capable to make computations, and human 
specialists that could interact in different points of decisions during the 
problems solving. research related to complex systems address analysis of many 
aspects such as complexity, self-organization, emergence, intelligence, 
hybridization and so forth. many computational complex systems developments 
require interdisciplinary approaches, which must include methods developed in 
different sciences, like sub-domains of the artificial intelligence like natural 
computing and intelligent agents. 

 
a particular subject by interest for this issue is represented by the 
self-organizing complex systems that use methods of natural computing in 
different tasks, like: problems solving, self-organization etc. this issue will 
centralize some state of the art results in the theme, which we estimate that 
will remain an important research direction in the near future.
 
recommended topics:
topics to be discussed in this special issue include (but are not limited to) 
the following:
 
·        artificial intelligence
·        large-scale and complex systems
·        hybrid complex systems
·        intelligent systems
·        natural computing
·        evolutionary systems
·        complex systems’modeling
·        agents and multi-agent systems
·        complex networks
·        difficult problem for a human specialist
·        difficult problem for a computational system
·        complex systems specialized in difficult problems solving
·        decision support systems
·        problem solving method used by a complex system
·        problems that could be solved by a complex system
·        large-scale cooperative agent-based systems 
·        self-organizing system 
 
submission procedure:

2,2013,ph.d. position in ethics of robotics (with a focus on robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders),"the department of philosophy of the university of twente in the netherlands
is looking for a ph.d. student in ethics of robotics, with a focus on
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

your profile

a master’s degree or equivalent degree in philosophy (preferably but not
exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues
relating to  human-robot interaction.  highly motivated to become part of
an international team of researchers and to contribute to the success of
the dream project. good analytical skills. good organizational skills. good
communication skills in english, in writing as well as orally. creativity,
open-mindedness and ability to develop new ideas.

our offer

we offer you a four-year full-time ph.d. position, starting in 2014 (the
exact starting date will be communicated during the interview) and at the
end you should have completed your phd thesis the gross salary is € 2.083,-
per month in the first year going up to €2.664,- in the fourth year.
additionally, the university of twente provides excellent facilities for
professional and personal development, a holiday allowance (amounts to 8%),
an end-of-year bonus (amounts to 8,3%) an a number of additional benefits.
the position also comes with a travel budget.

information and application

for information you can contact the research  leader of the “ethics” work
package, dr. m.j.k coeckelbergh (e-mail: m.j.k.coeckelbergh at utwente.nl)
your application should contain the following documents: a letter of
application which explain your motivation and interest in the position at
some length and explains your qualifications (this letter should contain
some suggestions on how you would want to approach this ph.d. project); a
curriculum vitae which includes the names and e-mail address/telephone
number of at least two academic references; a copy of your master’s thesis;
copies of publications, if any.
