1216,2012,phd position on stigmergic algorithms for robots," phd position on stigmergic algorithms for robots *****

         center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a phd student position in computer science
at örebro university,  sweden .  the position focuses on the study of
stigmergic algorithms for robotic devices.  the main area is artificial
intelligence, but the topic also relates to theoretical computer science
and to robotics.  research work will involve a combination of theory
development and empirical experiments.  apply by january 28, 2012.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
in detail
----------------------------------------------------------------------

about the research project:

sigmergy is one of the many fascinating phenomena which can be observed
in nature.  stigmergy is defined in wikipedia as: ""a mechanism of
indirect coordination between agents or actions, [in which] the trace
left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a
next action, by the same or a different agent"".  stigmergy has important
connections with robotics and computer science.  by stigmergy, many
simple robotic devices could, via indirect communication through the
environment, exhibit a collective behavior which is significantly more
complex than the individual behavior of each robot.

this phd project will study stigmergic algorithms for robotic devices.
the methodology will involve a combination of theoretical and practical
investigation.  the theoretical investigation will be aimed at defining
a robotic stigmergic system, as a function of the type of robots and of
the type of stigmergic medium in which they operate; and at studying the
formal properties of such a system, e.g., which global algorithms can be
implemented in a distributed way through stigmergy, and what are the
properties of these implementations (e.g., completeness, soundness,
convergence, optimality and computational complexity).  the practical
investigation will be aimed at verifying the hypotheses generated by the
theory through experiments performed in real, physical systems.  it will
employ a floor containing a regular grid of read/write rfid tags.

the successful candidate will be employed as a phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  the student is
expeted to collaborate with other international research groups
interested in the study of stigmergy in artificial systems.  a small
amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's duties.

about the working place:

örebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university which currently
enrolls more than 15,000 students.  it is located in örebro, a city of
130,000 inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass) is one of the
strong research environments at örebro university.  it carries out
multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, computer
science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  the research and
human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come
from a dozen different countries, in europe and worldwide, and have
different scientific and cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently
hosts international researchers and is involved in several international
projects.

aass is internationally renowned for its research in cognitive robotic
systems.  further information can be found at http://aass.oru.se/crs.

prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a clear interest in the above research topics, the
successful applicant must have an excellent background in mathematics
and computer science, and good programming skills.  a master's in
computer science, computer engineering or comparable field is required.
we particularly seek candidates with good knowledge of artificial
intelligence and with inclinations towards cross-disciplinary research.
previous experience with robotics is a plus.  knowledge of the swedish
language is not required, but proficiency in written and spoken english
is mandatory.

to apply for a position, please send the following material by e-mail to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <alessandro.saffiotti at aass.oru.se>.

1) a motivation letter;
2) an updated cv;
3) at least two academic references;

interaction process that aims to determine the user’s state as well as to produce the adequate response (e.g. empathy,
interest). this process will involve several channels: verbal, nonverbal, physiological, human and robot personalities.
hence, beyond traditional interaction technologies such as user localization, tracking, speech and gesture recognition,
the project investigates scientific methodologies for showing interest, paying attention, interpretation of intentions,
emotional states which are fundamental elements for initiating, maintaining and regulating interaction. verbal and non-
verbal communicative signals interpretation and attention mechanisms will be used to ensure a continuous interaction.

candidates:
interested candidates should have a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, and human-robot interaction.
moreover, the applicant should have strong skills in c/c++ programming, matlab, and the linux environment.

one fully funded ph.d. student position (3 years) is immediately
available at the aass mobile robotics and olfaction lab, university of
örebro,  sweden .
web site: http://www.aass.oru.se/research/mro/
contact: achim j. lilienthal (achim.lilienthal at oru.se).

the position focuses on life-long 3d map learning, including
quantitative measurements of both map quality and the performance of
the robot's tasks. research work will involve a combination of theory
development and empirical experiments.

detailed information can be found at
http://aass.oru.se/research/mro/announcements/phd_position-allo.pdf

http://aass.oru.se/research/mro/allo/


----------------------------------------------------------------------
in detail
----------------------------------------------------------------------

about the working place:

the ph.d. student will join the aass mobile robot and olfaction lab
(see http://aass.oru.se/research/mro/), one of the two research groups
at the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit
(http://www.oru.se/aass). the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic, and ph.d. students come from different
countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds
(currently there are 26 ph.d. students from 13 different
countries). aass often hosts international researchers, and is
involved in several international projects, thus providing
ph.d. students with opportunities to travel and cooperate with people
in other countries.


about the research project:

the position is funded mainly by the allo project: ""autonomous
long-term load-haul-dump operations"". this project is a joint effort
together with volvo construction equipment and ncc construction, and
will contribute to aass' strong position in 3d perception and
field-robotics research. the overall goal of the project is to enable
industrial wheel loaders working autonomously for several days, at a
real-world work site --- which means that the system must be able to
handle the dynamic nature of a site that is being changed by other
actors.

in particular, the following list outlines some important research
topics that will be handled in the project.
 * dynamic 3d map maintenance
 * map quality assurance
 * dynamic planning and scheduling
 * quantitative evaluation of pile handling

in our present collaborative project (the all-4-eham project) we have
developed the essential building blocks of such a system: scanning 3d
perception under vehicle motion, object detection, navigation and path
planning, and detection and shape analysis of gravel piles for efficient
handling.

the primary focus of the allo project will be the problems that an
autonomous system faces during long-term operation. other parts of the
project deal with improving the performance of the tasks from all-4-eham
and developing quantifiable and certifiable quality-evaluation criteria.
the focus on long-term operation puts further weight on the need to
develop consistent algorithms that produce correct results.


prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a strong interest in the topic, a solid theoretical
background and excellent programming skills (the current code base is
mainly written in c++), applicants should also have the equivalent of
a master's degree in a relevant field (e.g., physics, applied
mathematics, robotics, computer science, etc). we particularly seek
candidates with good knowledge of mathematical statistics and
numerical optimisation. experience in robotics (for example, ros or
the player/stage project) is a plus. proficiency in written/spoken
english is mandatory, but knowledge of swedish is not required.

to apply for a position, please send the following material by e-mail to
dr. martin magnusson <martin.magnusson at oru.se>:

1) a motivation letter,

offer for a post-doc position at inria (france) on navigation in dynamic and human-populated environments 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

title: 
------- 
navigation system in dynamic and human populated environments to improve the mobility of frail people. 

key words: 
--------------- 
robotics, navigation systems, perception, prediction, human aware navigation, assistance to frail people. 

summary: 
------------- 
this postdoc takes place in the scope of the inria large scale initiative action 
aen pal (personally assisted living http://pal.inria.fr/) which gathers the research activities 
of several inria research teams to improve the autonomy and the quality of life for the elderly 
and fragile persons. the action aims to create a research infrastructure that will offer 
technology solutions to improve the quality of life of frail people and their proximity circle. it 
focuses on the autonomy of the elderly in home health care by securing, preserving or 
restoring their functions necessary for everyday life. 

subject: 
---------- 
the objective of this postdoc is to develop navigation technologies adapted to the 
mobility assistance of aging or disabled people. the core of this work relies on 
complementary skills of arolag and e-motion inria projects concerning mapping, 
localization and safe navigation in dynamic and human populated environments. 
autonomous robotic systems are progressively moving from controlled laboratory 
environments towards real-world applications. state of the art approaches now endow robots 
with the ability to navigate within complex real-world environments by taking into account 
both the robot's surroundings and its position within the environment. additionally, the 
perceptual capabilities of these systems have recently been augmented through the use of realtime 
visual sensors that provide a very rich source of information [meilland10]. 
one of the major problems remains the capability to deal with large variations of the scene 
over time. 
a first objective will be to develop a novel approach to capture and characterize the 
information shared by different views of a dynamic and evolving environment registered 
under different conditions of observations. doing this, we expect to get a representation well 
adapted to autonomous navigation tasks and robust to the changes in the environment. 
relying on this representation, a second objective will be to develop navigation strategies that 
allow the robot to safely move in changing environment, with a socially acceptable behaviour. 
in the scope of the postdoc, we propose to integrate previous works developped both in 
arolag and e-motion research teams adressing the navigation decision process [fulgenz10], 
the spherical robot-centered representation of the environment described in [meilland11], 
abilities to predict the near future of this perceived environment [mvavasq 2007], and social 
conventions [irosrios 2011]. 
the core of the work will be focused on dynamic and evolving environments. by dealing with 
dynamic environment, we think of objects present in the environment moving in the scene 
(for example people) during the robot navigation. by evolving environment, we consider that 
configurations of the scene can change during time (door open or closed, chair, medical 
devices…) 
robustness, adaptability and cost of implementation of the developed technologies will be a 
major requirement. 
the approaches will be implemented on two experimental platforms: an automated 
wheelchair (inria platform at grenoble) and a smart walking aid (inria platform at 
sophia-antipolis).

*context*
the purpose of the project is to design a mobile communicating
companion robot, to provide assistance, and to ensure follow-up of
impaired people (elderly, disabled…). the role of the robot is to
perceive the situations of the “accompanied” person, his behavior and
needs, based on various sensors placed on both of them. the overall
objective is that the robot should be able to accompany and assist
impaired persons in a “natural” way, at home or during a walk, and
raise alerts in case of detected problem (fall, weakening…).
the work falls under the context of cooperation between two research
laboratories: lig (teams ama, magma, getalp) and gipsa-lab (team agpig).

*topic*
the work for the proposed phd will concentrate on the development of
perception and information processing system, which involves the
development of models for the dynamic analysis of complex situations.
the robot has been acquired in the framework of another university
project. it is built upon a robosoft robulab10 mobile platform
equipped with a robopec reeti expressive head, and video and audio
sensors to perceive its environment and analyze the followed person’s
movement and behavior. it is further able to capture physiological
data (heart and breathing rates…) from the sensors attached to the
person assisted.

data fusion techniques will be developed to analyze this
multidimensional heterogeneous information and to describe the person
situation, in terms that are physiological (emotional state, stress,
weakness…), behavioral (difficulty moving, fall…) and environmental
(presence of crowd, obstacles, ambient noise…). to cope with
uncertainty, incompleteness and inconsistency of the data, hypothesis
management and uncertainty models will be designed.

various problems are to be solved:

  * setting up the sensor and data transmission infrastructure for the
    robot and person assisted
  * low-level data processing (filtering, sampling), high level
    semantic information extraction (location characteristics, audio
    ambiance…)
  * setting up scenarios to create a learning database reflecting the
    various situations

 >from a more theoretical standpoint, the issues are:

  * fusion of heterogeneous data streams (video, audio, physiological
    sensors…)
  * modeling dynamic situations (transitions, events)
  * developing models to cope with data uncertainty, incompleteness
    and inconsistency and manage multiple hypotheses
  * development of active learning methods
  * designing methods for the detection of abnormal a priori unknown
    situations

frequently asked questions:

1) what kinds of research projects has intuitive funded in the past?
        prior projects have included the following topics:
            - fluorescence and other novel imaging methods for guiding surgery.
            - tissue characterization using electrical impedance measurements.
            - tissue bonding without sutures.
            - high force micro-manipulation mechanisms.
            - compact, yet dexterous mechanisms for minimally-invasive surgery.
            - robotic mechanisms for intravenous injection.
            - image-guided robotics.
- novel tissue cutting and manipulation methods.
            - use of intra-operative ultrasound for surgical navigation and monitoring.

2) can i use the grant funds to pay a student stipend or postdoc salary?
        yes, the funds can be used to pay salaries for students, postdocs, research engineers, faculty, or other staff that are directly involved in performing the research work. funds may also be used for purchasing materials, supplies, and equipment, as well as for any prototyping costs associated with the project.

3) does intuitive pay overhead costs?
        yes, we will pay overhead; however, due to the limited size of these grants, we require that you limit indirect costs to no more than 20%. the total costs, including both direct and indirect costs, as well as any applicable taxes, should not exceed $50,000 usd.

4) the guidelines indicate that grantees will be invited to present their project work and results in california. when will this happen and will intuitive cover the cost of travel and accommodations?
        this year, we invited all of our grant winners to sunnyvale for a research grant symposium day in january. this was a great event for interacting with other grant recipients, as well as with researchers and engineers at intuitive. we hope to repeat this symposium event annually and will cover travel costs for our grant winners.

5) the guidelines say that ip terms and conditions may apply. what does this mean?
        most university sponsored research departments will require that a sponsored research agreement be put in place prior to any sponsored project work. intuitive uses a fairly standard agreement for this purpose and we try to use this consistently for all grant projects. the agreement includes confidentiality and liability terms to protect both the research institution, as well as intuitive. in most cases, all intellectual property generated by the investigators during the course of the sponsored research work belongs to the institution. intuitive does not typically request or claim ownership to this ip; however, in cases where projects require closer collaboration and joint research work with intuitive, ip-sharing terms may need to be negotiated prior to the grant award.

*research topic: planning and navigation techniques for multi-robot 
teams in navigability maps.*

the research will address the problem of cooperative motion planning 
and  navigation for multi-robot teams in navigability maps. the 
classical approaches of navigation planning in occupancy maps and 
uncertain maps only represent the occupancy and the geometric 
uncertainty in the environment. this research will extend to multi-robot 
motion planning in maps where, in addition to the occupancy of the 
static and dynamic obstacles and their uncertainty, other information 
will be modeled, such as maps of communications in the areas of signal 
coverage to maintain a given quality (qos), and / or information about 
the likely of finding relevant objects or places in the scene.

this information will guide the planning of the trajectories for 
multi-robot systems within areas where it is likely to find the objects 
or places searched, or to have a good communication and dgps coverage. a 
model to represent that coherent and consistent heterogeneous 
information will be established. it will be oriented to motion planning 
with minimal risk or maximum success probability. probabilistic 
techniques will be used to represent information and to make coordinated 
navigation decisions consistent with the sensorial information.

research topic: long-term visual mapping
--------------------------------------------------------------------
this research work will consider the problem of long-term (or lifelong) visual 
mapping
using monocular or stereo cameras. first, we will develop fast and robust place
recognition techniques, using recently proposed binary features, specially the
scale and rotation invariant ones. we will investigate which clustering or hashing
techniques are more appropriate in binary spaces, and analyze their performance
for loop closure and camera relocation using the bag-of-words technique.
second, we will address the problems of long-term mapping; detection of changes in
the environment, map updating, removal of obsolete parts, and use of learning
techniques to identify stable versus instable areas of the environment. the goal 
would
be having a robot to autonomously learn that areas such as desktops are prone
to change in appearance, and focus the relocation algorithms in the more stable 
regions.

university of hertfordshire, uk, http://www.herts.ac.uk/home-page.cfm

human-robot interaction is a quickly growing research area with a number of applications in assistive technology and service robotics. the research team at university of hertfordshire led by prof. dautenhahn is involved in several projects relevant to this field, namely aurora and roboskin (where we investigate the use of the kaspar robot in human‐robot interaction scenarios with children with autism) and lirec/accompany (where we study robots as long-term companions e.g. for use in the homes of elderly people). a key research issue relevant to both projects concerns the adaptation of the robot’s behaviour e.g. to the individual needs and preferences of the person. a personalized robot companion needs to know its users, and be able to adapt in long-term interaction.

the phd project will focus of the topic of social learning and adaptation, i.e. will develop the robot’s ability to be taught by its user, and to learn socially by observing and analyzing the interaction. such research is strongly inspired by biology and psychology concerning the way how humans and other animals learn from each other by observation, interaction and communication. another area of inspiration comes from developmental psychology since infants learn many new skills in interaction with their caretakers. the group has a strong track record in the area of imitation and social learning. the team at university of hertfordshire is one of the internationally leading teams in human‐robot interaction. the phd student will develop new social learning and adaptation algorithms, as well as participate in the preparation, implementation and analysis of human‐robot interaction studies. depending on the student’s abilities and interests, the focus of the phd research could be either on assistive technology (cf. our work on robot‐assisted play for children with autism http://www.aurora‐project.com) or on home companions (service robots, see e.g. http://lirec.eu/ and http://accompanyproject.eu/).

the phd student will be part of a larger research team consisting of researchers working in the above mentioned european projects, as well as other research group members. the phd student will have the opportunity to work with state of the art humanoid robots, including kaspar (http://www.kaspar.herts.ac.uk/) which was developed by our research group.

research in computer science at the university of hertfordshire has been recognized as excellent by the latest research assessment exercise, with 55% of the research submitted being rated as world leading or internationally excellent. the science and technology research institute provides a very stimulating environment, offering a large number of specialized and interdisciplinary seminars as well as general training opportunities. the university of hertfordshire is situated in hatfield, just north of london.

applicants are required to have a strong first degree or master’s degree in computer science, robotics or a related area relevant to the project. an additional background in human‐computer interaction, cognitive science or psychology is highly desirable. excellent programming skills are essential (including c++), the ability to interface robot sensors and develop software on robots is a necessary requirement of this studentship, as well as a general interest in interdisciplinary research and willingness to collaborate with researchers from other disciplines. the ideal candidate will be self‐motivated with good writing and communication skills.

successful candidates are eligible for a research studentship award from the university (approximately £13,600 per annum bursary plus the payment of the standard uk/eu student fees). applicants from outside the uk or eu are eligible, but will have to pay half of the overseas fees out of their bursary. information about the current tuition fees can be found at
http://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/fees-and-funding/postgraduate/home.cfm

the phd will be supervised by prof. kerstin dautenhahn (k.dautenhahn at herts.ac.uk), whom interested candidates are invited to contact via email in the first instance. note, all applications must be made formally via our research office: http://homepages.stca.herts.ac.uk/~comqvs/applicationformuhstudentship.doc

1319,2012,public release of the robot construction kit,"the rock development team is proud to announce the official public 
release of the robot construction kit (rock).

    http://rock-robotics.org

rock is a software framework for the development of robotic systems. the 
underlying component model is based on orocos/rtt (real time toolkit). 
rock provides all the tools required to set up and run high-performance 
and reliable robotic systems for a wide variety of applications in 
research and industry. it contains a rich collection of ready-to-use 
drivers and modules for use in your own system, and can easily be 
extended by adding new components. the framework was developed to 
specifically address the following issues in existing solutions:

sustainable systems.
    the architecture and the tools in rock are designed with
    long-running systems in mind. in practice this means that for us,
    error detection, reporting and handling are key in any robotic
    architecture.

scalability.
    provide the tools to be able to manage big systems with minimum
    fuss. but we don't require you to learn about these (complex) tools
    right away: as soon as you use rock's component development tool,
    orogen, you have the guarantee that your components can be
    integrated - from simple scenarios using hard-coded c++ behaviors,
    to ruby scripts, up to the complete system monitoring tools.

reusable code-base.
    even though we think that the rock toolchain is one of the best out
    there, some other people might feel differently. and they might be
    right. that's why in rock most of the functionality – from control
    to data display through to data processing – is implemented in a way
    that is totally independent from rock's integration framework.
    that's right: just pick our drivers, localization algorithms and
    control loops and add them into your integration framework. you
    don't have to do anything on our side, as the code is completely
    independent from the integration parts.

    installation

so far, the development of the robot construction kit has been supported 
by the dfki robotics innovation center (http://www.dfki.de/robotics) in

this projects will study how a robot can autonomously acquire the skills 
and models required to accomplish precise dynamic control of its arms 
and legs in unstructured environments. the goal is to complement the 
model based controller and planner methods with adaptive and learning 
methods, to adapt to changes in the robot & environment dynamics, e.g. 
payloads, different grounds, failures of components etc.

background:

the successful candidates will work in the frame of a larger effort to 
get robots with arms and legs out of the lab into unstructured 
environments such as homes, factory floors, construction and disaster 
sites. we want these machines to work robustly in such environments and 
do useful work to assist humans in tasks that are too dangerous, require 
more strength or endurance or are simply tedious. these tasks pose many 
challenging problems for robots, from control to perception and 
'intelligence'.

the successful candidates for this positions are going to work on 
control and learning control for such robots doing 'autonomous mobile 
legged manipulation'.

the solutions will be evaluated in the frame of a mock-up disaster 
recovery scenario on existing robot hardware (iit hyq, starleth, sarcos 
humanoid, etc).

possible topics include:

- control of legged locomotion
- whole body control
- planning for dynamic motions of robots with arms and legs
- multi-contact control

research subject

colorectal cancer has become a major healthcare problem with over 1 million
new cases diagnosed annually worldwide. there is an urgent need for new
early stage screening and detection systems that are both cost-effective
and patient friendly. the 5-year eu-funded codir project (http://codir.org/)
has been set up to address this problem through the development a novel
semi-autonomous robot for colonic investigation and early diagnosis. the
project is led by the eminent surgeon professor sir alfred cuschieri. the
objective is to create a patient-friendly system for inspection of the
colon, under the control of a clinician operating a robot.

the master’s research work aims to generate algorithmic solutions for
motion planning and control of semi-autonomous generic robot devices inside
hollow human organs.  the targeted environment is the colon, although this
could be extended to other organs as the objective is to generate adaptive
behaviors based on fluid and tissue interaction with the device, in which
low organ stiffness is a critical issue.

the methodology proposed is based on modeling and simulation of 3
dimensional deformable tissues in interaction with fluids (including
turbulent two phase fluid environments) and generic rigid body devices. the
first part would be boosted by collaboration with australia's national
science agency (csiro http://www.csiro.au/)  which will provide us with a
mechanically realistic simulation of the colon that is used for actual
colonoscopy training devices.  the models and simulations obtained will be
constantly validated and updated by experiments in physical phantoms of the
colon and thiel cadavers. these “mechanical models” are equipped with
sensors and linked to data acquisition systems and are under continuous
development by the codir team.

in the first semester the student will focus on the interaction between the
organ’s wall, the fluid and the generic robot, formulating and validating
an appropriate tool to host the generic motion algorithms.  in the
following semester the student will develop the motion planning and control
algorithms for this dynamic environment. the student will have access to
imsat and the university of dundee facilities in order to perform
experiments. these facilities include, amongst others, access to thiel
embalmed human cadavers and animal organs, a fully equipped mechanical
workshop and 3d prototyping printers. in addition, the student will use the
novel robots which are being developed for the codir project, in order to
test and validate his/her research work.

the potential of this research lies in the concept that improvements in
modeling and simulation can enable more accurate and robust pre- and
intra-operative planning. in addition, semi-autonomous devices that can
safely navigate and find their way inside dynamically changing environments
can increase the success rate of inherently uncertain surgical
(*e.g.*colonic) interventions.

imsat (http://www.imsat.org/) is a well-equipped research institute located
close to ninewells hospital, a major medical school in dundee, scotland.
the imsat staff in general, and the codir team in particular, enjoy a happy
and thriving research environment with good funding and many opportunities
for aspiring and talented students from all over the world.

title: phd position in advanced modeling



the institute of machine tools and manufacturing, at eth http://www.iwf.mavt.ethz.ch/index_en is seeking a ph.d. researcher in the area of machine design, precision engineering and control.



problem statement

in the sub-micron range motion systems have to satisfy strong specifications in a plurality of aspects. accuracy requirements in the nanometre-level, dynamic specifications in tens of g, but also economic target values have thoroughly to be met at the same time. for this reason, the development of sub-micron motion systems constantly expands to the borders of feasibility imposed by physical laws, this in order to allow full exploitation of the principles of precision engineering. for this task dedicated simulation represents an enabling mean for the development of future generations of these dedicated mechanisms. the modeling of corresponding systems requires the fusion of mechanical, thermal, electric, metrology and control disciplines in order do obtain the properties of the systems under investigation.



scientific objectives

the scientific focus of the thesis can be outlined as:

""advanced modeling of static and dynamic behaviors in complex machines""



the work will cover precision engineering in the nanometer range for high acceleration and high accuracy. this involves:

  1) elaboration of an adequate actuation system

  2) selection of an applicable metrology and control strategy

  3) realization of a prototype and assessment of properties for validation

  4) deduction of a procedure to transform system requirements of sub-micron motion systems into the design of these systems



organisation of the thesis

the selected ph.d. student will work at eth, under an employment contract with the company etel, which he will visit regularly during the three years of thesis.

content of the thesis: system analysis, modeling, actuation, metrology, design, simulation

requirements:          interest to work in a cutting edge, industry-related topic



applicants should send a cover letter briefly describing their background and career plans, a cv, and the names and contact

information for at least three references. the position is open immediately. these documents should be submitted as pdf attachments to dr. sascha weikert: weikert at inspire.ethz.ch<mailto:weikert at inspire.ethz.ch>"

1334,2012,phd position in handibio laboratory in toulon - south east france,"hello,

a phd position is now opened in our biomecanics and rehabilitation  
robotics laboratory.
the applications should be sent before the 30th of july for a start  
september the 1st.



phd position in rehabilitation robotics and human motion analysis.
(claire dune, philippe gorce handibio and jean-pierre merlet inria-coprin)

clinical evaluation of frailty in the elderly is the first step to  
decide the degree of assistance they require. this evaluation is  
usually performed once and for all by filling standard forms with  
macro-information about standing and walking abilities, eg by  
measuring the time taken to walk 10m.

in this project, a new frailty evaluation tool will be developed,  
based on a standard  zimmer-frame. the basic idea is to equip a  
standard medical device with sensors (force, vision, laser) to track  
the evolution of elderly walking ability in their every day life.

the first challenge is to model the human-walker system in order to  
find relevant biomechanic indices that indicate the degree of frailty.  
the second point is to estimate these indices using the data acquired  
by the walker. the results will be compared to those obtained with  
standard human motion analysis systems.

requirements:
- masters degree in computer science, electrical engineering with honors,
- experience in robotics, signal processing,
- good programming skills in matlab/python c/c++
- a strong mathematical background is desirable

environment:
the handibio laboratory and the inria coprin research team are located  
in the south-east of france, respectively in the university town of  
toulon and sophia antipolis. since 2011, handibio as joined the inria  
national research project pal (personnaly assisted living), lead by  
the coprin team. they joined their expertise in biomechanics and  
robotics to develop new motion analysis devices for people frailty

1335,2012,"phd position in medical robotics at lsiit laboratory, strasbourg, france","the lsiit laboratory in strasbourg, france, offers a phd position in  
the avr research group (automatic control, vision and robotics) for a 
thesis project proposition named :
""developpment of measure solutions for medical flexible endoscopy""

*context : robotized assistance to flexible endoscopy
*
this phd position concerns the field of robotic assistance to medical 
interventions. we aim
at assisting procedures involving flexible systems such as flexible 
endoscopes. flexible systems are largely used in the medical field 
because they have the capability to reach distant areas of interest 
through tortuous and restricted natural channels (oesophagus, colon, 
urethra, veins, etc.). nowadays these systems are used for complex tasks 
such as complete surgical
operations. for these new uses the required positioning accuracy is 
important and in this context motorization and robotization appear as 
interesting solutions for manipulation problems. for instance 
robotization allows teleoperation modes or autonomous assistance.

however, in practice the automatic control of these flexible systems is 
difficult. because of the transmission of motion through long flexible 
shafts, often under constraints, non-linear behaviors are observed, 
which are dependent on multiple parameters. it is then difficult to 
obtain good models and consequently open-loop model-based control is not 
satisfying. for obtaining a good positioning accuracy in the operational 
space the use of an additional sensing system seems mandatory. up today 
most of works in this direction use electromagnetic sensors. they allow 
to quickly assess control schemes in the laboratory, but they are not 
directly usable in vivo.

*objectives : use of embedded camera for accurate positioning
*
in this phd thesis work we aim at exploring the possibilities offered by 
embedded vision for controlling robotized flexible systems and their 
instruments. three kinds of problems can be
studied :
     * positioning of the flexible system holding the camera with respect
     to the environment,
     * positioning simple instruments (without dof) passing through a
     channel of the flexible system with respect to this system and with
     respect to the environment,
     * positioning flexible instruments (with dofs) with respect to the
     flexible system and the environment.

the requirements will be mainly focused on accuracy but we will also be 
interested by the bandwidth, which is interesting for tracking 
physiological motion. besides the endoscopic images, data from motors 
encoders and flexible systems models will be used.

these approaches will first be assessed in the laboratory using the 
flexible robotic systems of lsiit and isir, for application to 
teleoperation and automatic motion. the solutions will also be
compared to the use of additional sensors usually proposed in the 
literature but not applicable in vivo, such as accelerometers or 
magnetic sensors, in order to show feasibility and / or limitations of 
the use of images.

the final objective is to assist the medical staff during operations 
using flexible systems. two main applications are planned: intraluminal 
surgery for electrosurgical cutting and ureteroscopy for laser lithiasis 
destruction.

*research environment : lsiit / isir collaboration inside the cami
       ""excellence laboratory""
*
the phd student will mainly work in the avr group in strasbourg, france
(newlsiit.u-strasbg.fr/avr_fr/index.php/accueil). he will be located on 
the medical robotic platform at the ircad in downtown strasbourg. ircad 
(www.ircad.fr) is a world-renowned
institute of research on digestive cancers.
the work will be realized in collaboration with the agathe team at isir 
(paris) inside the ""excellence laboratory"" cami (computer assisted 
medical intervention) a french multi-platforms laboratory dedicated to 
computer-assisted interventions (www.cami-labex.fr/).

the avr group has developed several robotic prototypes for intraluminal 
surgery. the isir team has also developed a motorized urological 
flexible system. the phd student will have access to these systems at 
the beginning of the thesis.
the thesis project is also partly integrated in the scope of strasbourg 
ihu (institut hospitalo- universitaire) mixsurg. the phd student will be 
able to perform in vivo validations at the ircad.

*expected candidate profile
*
the candidate must have a master degree or should have graduated from an 
engineering school with major in computer vision, robotics or image 
processing.

good knowledge in computer programming  (c / c++, linux) and knowledge 
of computer vision hardware (video cameras, framegrabbers) are 
mandatory. liking of medical field and practical experiments is welcome.

*practical informations

1336,2012,phd positions - auv cognition & autonomy,"phd positions available
2012-2015

persistent autonomy for underwater vehicles



phd positions are available immediately on research programmes aiming to 
enhance the cognition of autonomous underwater vehicles (auvs). the 
overall research theme is persistent autonomy – developing the 
underlying computational mechanisms that enable auvs to achieve mission 
goals in unforeseen situations by adapting their actions based on 
observation and description of their environment, their condition and 
their own performance in executing tasks. applications are for 
inspection, cleaning and intervention tasks in the oilfield using hover 
capable auvs, and for underwater archaeological survey with multiple 
vehicles.

three technical areas are being emphasised, complementing a portfolio of 
work already underway. the phds will be drawn from these areas according 
to the interest and aptitude of the successful applicants.

1.matching and adapting semantic descriptions of the surrounding 
environment in ontologies using feature based localisation (slam) from 
forward looking sonar and video imagery. initially, slam methods are 
used to localise a vehicle relative to a structure. however, beyond this 
we wish to match observed features to those expected based on a known 
geometry and associated semantic description. the objective is to first 
identify where the known geometry is incorrect, and subsequently 
consider building semantic descriptions (ontologies) of unknown objects. 
the semantic descriptions are then used as the basis for planning or 
plan repair to meet mission goals.

2.detection and diagnosis of failure in task execution based on 
available sensor data and on the state of action execution in adaptive 
controllers and skill learning modules. simple actions, such as move or 
hover, output from a mission planner will in general succeed at 
execution. however, more complex actions such as grasping and turning a 
valve or cleaning with a water jet may fail. the robot must detect this 
failure based on available information, where possible diagnose the 
cause, and then replan a further attempt. key technology developments 
are required for these detection and diagnosis phases.

3.optimising information exchange services between collaborating auvs 
engaged in a joint mapping exercise using low bandwidth and intermittent 
acoustic communication. vehicles should share mapping and other mission 
information as they acoustically and optically survey the seabed, 
automatically detecting objects of interest. data exchange takes place 
within a service oriented architecture. methods are required to ensure 
only timely information is exchanged and relayed appropriately, bearing 
in mind mission goals and the context of the data.

applications are sought from interested individuals with msc or 1st/2.1 
honours degree (or equivalent) in computer science, signal processing or 
robotics, and with practical aptitudes/interests in real autonomous 
underwater vehicles and sensors. field trials in scotland and europe are 
involved. successful candidates will join an existing team of 
experienced researchers.

the positions are of three years duration, starting immediately, with 
all fees covered and an annual stipend of up to £15k.

1338,2012,"phd student position and scholarship ""formal validation and verification of robotic systems"", verimag grenoble and laas/cnrs toulouse, france","a phd scholarship in the area of ""formal validation and verification of robotic systems"" 
is being offered jointly at verimag, grenoble and laas-cnrs, toulouse, for the fall 2012,
under the joint supervision of saddek bensalem and felix ingrand.
application deadline: july 31

formal validation and verification of robotic systems

verimag and laas started a few years ago an effort to provide a framework to deploy robust and formally verifiable robotics software. they combined a state of the art tool for developing functional modules of robotic systems (genom) with a component based framework for implementing embedded real-time systems (bip).  over the years, they have successfully developed a first version of the genom/bip component based design approach and applied it to the functional level of a complex exploration rover. this original approach allows to :
- produce a very fine grained formal computational model of the robot functional level; 
- run the bip engine on the real robot, which executes and enforces the model semantics at runtime; and 
- check the model offline for deadlock freedom, as well as other safety properties using tools such as d-finder.

the latest evolution of genom (genom3) is templates based, and while retaining the ""codels"", execution automata organization to implement functional module services and posters, it allows now to produce modules for different robotics middlewares (cslib, ros com, etc). in parallel, recent evolutions of the bip framework and toolset allow the use of timed models and models distribution over more than one cpu, and provide a realtime bip engine which is able to execute these models on the targeted platform.

the objective of this phd is to pursue the joint genom/bip effort to allow the development of robust and verifiable functional layer for robots, as well as to study the extensions of this approach toward the decisional level of the robot (planning/supervision). this will be applied to different platforms, in particular on a pr2 (willow garage) robot at laas but also on a fleet of uav each running its own genom/bip model, with execution coordination (performed in bip) among them. 

required candidate background:
- major in computer science
- software engineering and good programming skills (c/c++)

background knowledge in the following areas would be a plus.
- robot programming (fluency with tools like ros, genom, orocos, bcm, etc would be a plus)
- formal methods for validation and verification

the phd candidate will be mostly based at verimag in grenoble, but will make long visits (few months each year) at laas (toulouse) to implement and test its work on the various robotic platforms (pr2, uav, etc).

microscope) environment

*

contacts: *yassine.haddab at femto-st.fr ou philippe.lutz at femto-st.fr***
research institute: *as2m department of femto-st institute (besançon, 
france)**

the aimof the thesis is the development of advanced control, adapted to 
control systems in an sem for manipulation and characterization of 
micro/nano-objects. the planned work can be divided into two parts: the 
first one will focus on the characterization and modelling of noise 
inside a sem and the second will involve the control of microrobots end 
effectors to perform micromanipulation tasks on delicate components with 
small sizes (some dimensions may be as small as 100 nanometers or less). 
theseend effectors can be either microgrippers or tools developed at 
upmc / isir and femto-st.

the thesis is part of the anr project ""nanorobust"" bringing femto-st in 
besançon, the isir in paris, the lpn in marcoussis and irisa in rennes. 
thales research technologies is also involved in this work. the overall 
objective of nanorobust is to provide a robotic platform for 
nanomanipulation and physical characterization by scanning electron 
microscope.

the control ofmicrorobots and microsystems faces many difficulties 
related to the miniaturization. these difficulties are due on the one 
hand in researchinghigh performance in terms of resolution and accuracy, 
and partly to the high sensitivity of these systems to environmental 
conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) and noise. moreover, in these 
dimensional scales, the signal/noise ratios are unfavorable because of 
very low amplitudes of the useful signals. the actuation in micro/nano 
world is mostly done with active materials (piezoelectric, shape memory 
alloys, etc.) or deformable structures associated with a physical effect 
(electrostatic actuators, etc.). controlling the interaction force 
between the gripping tools and the nano-objects is essential to perform 
nanomanipulation and characterization. dynamic modelling of noise is an 
essential step to enable ultra precise control needed for handling and 
characterizing nano-objects.

*skills expected:* the candidate should havegood knowledge of control 
and signal processing. knowledge to use will be adapted based on the 
evolution of the thesis but a good starting point would be : state 
representation and state feedback control, observers and estimators 
synthesis, robust control, sensitivity analysis, noise filtering, 
optimal filtering (kalman, etc.) fourier analysis and digital signal 
processing using matlab and simulink. of course, some of these skills 
may be acquired during the thesis through training. furthermore, a first 
experience in micro/nano systems is welcome but not essential."

details of the call:

theme 2.1: social augmentation for robotic platforms using computer vision and machine learning

recent research in robotics is trying hard to push robots out of factories and research laboratories. effective operation in everyday environments requires not only sophisticated and robust perceptual systems but also the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues and human intentions. such capabilities are fundamental prerequisites to program the robot to react appropriately to humans and to bias the interpretation of the scene using nonverbal cues (gaze or body gestures).
the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social intentions. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot or his posture and intentions. conventional research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on applications in which the image patch of a whole person (or group of people) is visible without strong occlusions in. on the other hand, face-to-face interaction requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. this egocentric (first-person) computer vision is of certain importance and of foreseen widespread diffusion also for humans given the introduction of new compact and wearable devices (e.g. google project glass prototypes).

this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have computer programming skills.

the following research topics are available:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.2 - dextrous manipulation learning with bimanual compliant robots

robotic systems get increasingly complex with the fast development of new hardware and sensing technologies, not only with respect to the number of motors and sensors, but also with respect to the new actuation/perception modalities that will be endowed in tomorrow's robots. one such new perspective is to go beyond reference trajectory tracking control by exploiting active and/or intrinsic compliance capabilities of the robots. such perspective requires us to redefine the machine learning problems towards a flexible regulation of stiffness and damping behaviors. with the fast development and expected widespread use of these new robot technologies, one key element for robot learning by imitation and exploration is to flexibly encode the learned skills with a minimum number of efficient control variables. the aim is to guarantee generalization and adaptation capabilities while avoiding to grow with the number of articulations or sensory modalities, in order to ensure real-time adaptive behavior.

the problem of bimanual coordination in such new settings needs to be thoroughly revisited. this phd proposal will address research themes such as learning and adaptation of local sensory-motor activity couplings. the principle of reducing the complexity of a non-linear trajectory by representing it as a superposition of simple local motion elements (or movement primitives) will be extended to concepts such as impedance primitives or synergy primitives.

the role of haptics in dextrous manipulation skill acquisition will be explored in the context of bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as in an industrial context with an innovative cooperative manufacturing setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.3 - from human-human to human-robot collaborative skills acquisition

the recent introduction of robots with compliant capabilities into the robotics market has opened up a host of new, human-centric research possibilities, for scientists working in the fields of robot learning and social robotics. two examples include kinesthetic teaching and human-robot cooperation. because robots are no longer ""put behind fences"", they are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires engineers to make drastic changes in the way robots move, learn and interact with users. this phd proposal addresses the problem of transferring collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner. such skills involve rich and diverse behaviors such as the assignment of leader/follower behaviors, passive/active roles switching, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent.

there are clear limitations to engineering solutions currently being used to implement such skills in robots. critically, these skills sometimes appear to us as naturally grounded. it is proposed to study how versatile robotic peers could be developed, by looking at human-human collaboration to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms supporting the acquisition of collaborative manipulation skills.

the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human-human cooperation will be studied in collaboration with prof. roger newman-norlund, director of the division of motor control and rehabilitation at the university of south carolina. the nature and roles of mutual responsiveness, complementary action, intention recognition and empathy in joint action will be studied from behavioral, psychological and cognitive neuroscience perspectives, by considering the performance of human-human dyads comprised of healthy subjects and subjects with impaired social abilities (i.e. autism).

the human-robot cooperation experiments will be conducted with the compliant full humanoid robot coman, as well as with two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.


** theme 3.4 - learning from demonstrations in a soft robotic arm for assistance in minimally invasive surgery

this phd proposal takes place within the stiff-flop project (stiffness controllable flexible and learn-able manipulator for surgical operations), which is a collaboration with 11 universities, research institutes and companies in europe (kcl, uk, sssa, italy, tri,  spain , piap, poland, huji, israel, uos, uk, usiegen, germany, shadow, uk, frk, poland and eaes, netherlands).

in minimally invasive surgery, tools go through narrow openings and manipulate soft organs that can move, deform, or change stiffness. there are limitations in current robot-assisted surgical systems due to the rigidity of robot tools. a soft robotic arm will be available within the project to manipulate objects while controlling the stiffness of selected body parts. this phd proposal will focus on the learning, human-robot interaction and variable compliance manipulation aspects.

the objective is to exploit the relevant statistical information contained in multiple demonstrations from the teleoperator to learn force/position control manoeuvres so that the teleoperator can, over time, concentrate on high level decisions while the robot takes care of low level reactive control manoeuvres in a semi-autonomous fashion. the phd candidate will conduct robotic experiments to answer a number of key questions in applied machine learning to control the stiffness of selected parts of the body, to move in a constrained space, and to exert desired forces on soft objects with uncertain impedance parameters.

probabilistic models such as hidden markov models (hmm) and gaussian mixture regression (gmr) will be explored to learn control policies that take into account variability and correlation information collected by consecutive trials. the learning problem will be explored in tight connection with the control problem to orchestrate the degrees of coupling of the flexible arm that best suit the statistics of the task (e.g., by stiffening the arm in task relevant dimensions).

research subject

colorectal cancer has become a major healthcare problem with over 1 million
new cases diagnosed annually worldwide. there is an urgent need for new
early stage screening and detection systems that are both cost-effective
and patient friendly. the 5-year eu-funded codir project (http://codir.org/)
has been set up to address this problem through the development a novel
semi-autonomous robot for colonic investigation and early diagnosis. the
project is led by the eminent surgeon professor sir alfred cuschieri. the
objective is to create a patient-friendly system for inspection of the
colon, under the control of a clinician operating a robot.

the master’s research work aims to generate algorithmic solutions for
motion planning and control of semi-autonomous generic robot devices inside
hollow human organs.  the targeted environment is the colon, although this
could be extended to other organs as the objective is to generate adaptive
behaviors based on fluid and tissue interaction with the device, in which
low organ stiffness is a critical issue.

the methodology proposed is based on modeling and simulation of 3
dimensional deformable tissues in interaction with fluids (including
turbulent two phase fluid environments) and generic rigid body devices. the
first part would be boosted by collaboration with australia's national
science agency (csiro http://www.csiro.au/)  which will provide us with a
mechanically realistic simulation of the colon that is used for actual
colonoscopy training devices.  the models and simulations obtained will be
constantly validated and updated by experiments in physical phantoms of the
colon and thiel cadavers. these “mechanical models” are equipped with
sensors and linked to data acquisition systems and are under continuous
development by the codir team.

in the first semester the student will focus on the interaction between the
organ’s wall, the fluid and the generic robot, formulating and validating
an appropriate tool to host the generic motion algorithms.  in the
following semester the student will develop the motion planning and control
algorithms for this dynamic environment. the student will have access to
imsat and the university of dundee facilities in order to perform
experiments. these facilities include, amongst others, access to thiel
embalmed human cadavers and animal organs, a fully equipped mechanical
workshop and 3d prototyping printers. in addition, the student will use the
novel robots which are being developed for the codir project, in order to
test and validate his/her research work.

the potential of this research lies in the concept that improvements in
modeling and simulation can enable more accurate and robust pre- and
intra-operative planning. in addition, semi-autonomous devices that can
safely navigate and find their way inside dynamically changing environments
can increase the success rate of inherently uncertain surgical
(*e.g.*colonic) interventions.

imsat (http://www.imsat.org/) is a well-equipped research institute located
close to ninewells hospital, a major medical school in dundee, scotland.
the imsat staff in general, and the codir team in particular, enjoy a happy
and thriving research environment with good funding and many opportunities
for aspiring and talented students from all over the world.

theme 2.1: social augmentation for robotic platforms using computer vision
and machine learning 
tutor: lorenzo natale, alessio del bue 
n. of available positions: 1

recent research in robotics is trying hard to push robots out of factories
and research laboratories. effective operation in everyday environments
requires not only sophisticated and robust perceptual systems but also the
ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as
simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction
entails the ability to interpret social cues and human intentions. such
capabilities are fundamental prerequisites to program the robot to react
appropriately to humans and to bias the interpretation of the scene using
nonverbal cues (gaze or body gestures).
the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of
capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social intentions.
examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to
interact with the robot or his posture and intentions. conventional research
in computer vision and machine learning focuses on applications in which the
image patch of a whole person (or group of people) is visible without strong
occlusions in. on the other hand, face-to-face interaction requires
developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas
of the body are occluded or only partially visible. this egocentric
(first-person) computer vision is of certain importance and of foreseen
widespread diffusion also for humans given the introduction of new compact
and wearable devices (e.g. google project glass prototypes).

this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility in
collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision
(pavis). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or
engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine
learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform
and have computer programming skills.

theme 2.2: haptic exploration for humanoid navigation with a compliant robot

tutor: nicolas perrin, francecsco nori, nikos tsagarakis, giorgio metta
n. of available positions: 1

humans are able to modify their usual strategy for locomotion in order to
move in a cluttered environment without any visual information. the goal of
this phd research program is to perform this difficult task with a compliant
humanoid robot. more precisely, we will study the problem of navigation in
an unknown environment with a ""blind"" humanoid robot. this may require
haptic exploration with the feet to find flat and stable surfaces, or arm
motions to check for the absence of obstacles through haptic exploration
including proprioceptive joint measurements or full body tactile skin
sensing, or on the contrary find safe contacts to increase balance. the
successful candidate will investigate various algorithms and multi-contact
planning strategies in order to solve this problem in complicated
environments. in a first phase, quasi-static motions might be considered,
but trying to maximize the robot speed will ultimately be an objective of
prime importance. because of their increased ability to absorb shocks, it is
expected that passively compliant robots can perform blind navigation faster
than other robots, and the successful candidate should try to demonstrate
this intuition. experiments will be made on the passively compliant
coman/icub platforms:

http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-h
umanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html
. http://www.icub.org
developed at the department of advanced robotics (advr), robotics brain and
cognitive sciences (rbcs) and at the icub facility of the iit. solving this
complex problem in a robust way is expected to have an impact far beyond the
sole application of blind navigation.

requirements: the ideal candidate should have a degree in engineering or
computer science (or equivalent), be highly motivated to work on robotic
platforms and have very strong computer programming skills, including
experience with c/c++ in the unix environment. good writing and
communicating skills in english are essential.

theme 3.13: dynamic walking and running of compliant humanoid robots on rough terrain
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1 

the application of humanoids in the human environment requires the mobility of walking and running on the reconstructed terrain in contrast to a prepared and known lab environment. there are a plenty of existing methods, such as the zmp based pattern generation, which can provide dynamically feasible trajectories for walking and running on a flat ground. however, most of the methods are designed for the humanoid robots with stiff actuations. due to the high stiffness of the actuators, the capability of adapting the rough and uneven terrain is very limited. moreover, a more agile and dynamic movement requires a more compliant interaction with the environment in order to reduce the impacts. these essential demands can be solved by designing the smart mechanism that exploits the intrinsic compliance as the nature shows in biological land animals.

with the new compliant hardware and the task of walking on the rough terrain, there is a raising demand of a new control methodology that makes use of the physical compliance for smooth interaction and provides the feasible controllers to generate variety types of walking and running gaits. differ from the engineering approaches from which a lot of artificial constraints are unnatural imposed, such as the zmp method, the new research would investigate the results from the passive dynamic walkers and the nonlinearity of the step-to-step transitions. typically for humans, walking and running do not necessarily involve symmetric or periodic alternation of legs. the limit cycle approach investigates the cyclic gaits which demonstrate self-stability.  the proposed research topic will focus on the extraction of the fundamental principles of the limit cycle method previously applied on passive dynamic walkers (typically gravity powered walking). a number of methods for controlling the kinetic energy will be studied and further extend it to a more general principle for dynamic walking and running. the implementation and experimental validation will be finally conducted on the rough terrain. the research platform for testing the hypotheses is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

 
theme 3.14: stabilization and balance control of the compliant humanoid robots 
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1 

while operating in human environment, the humanoid robots permanently have the risk of colliding with unexpected objects and falling. to tackle the collisions and prevent a fall are crucial regarding the safety for both humans and robots. the stabilization of the proposed research will focus on the passivity based compliance control to attenuate the undesired oscillations and movements caused by impacts during the robots’ interaction with the environment, especially for the robots with physical compliant materials.

the balancing control will investigate different strategies to maintain the equilibrium. for small and moderate disturbances, the robot could balance without taking steps. however, since the capability of keeping balance is limited given a fixed size of the support area, the robot must exploit other strategies such as taking steps when the increasing disturbance is able to topple the robot. the proposed research will develop the balance control using both the simplified model and a full body dynamics model. the feedbacks for the balance control will require the sensor fusion of a number of different signals, such as the linkage positions (proprioception), the reaction forces acting in feet (haptics) and the inertial measurement (inner ears). the algorithms are expected to be tolerant to parameter variations and robust to different types of disturbances (external pushes and terrain surface variations). the research platform for testing the algorithms is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in:
1. rigid body dynamics, mechanics;
2. classical and modern control theory;
3. programming skills (matlab, c/c++);
4. good in english communication.

candidates are encouraged to send their cv prior to application.

1388,2012,postdoctoral research assistant in gait and activity recognition - oxford brookes university (fabio cuzzolin),"faculty of technology, design and environment
postdoctoral research assistant in gait and activity recognition
starting salary: £24,520 rising annually to £26,779

this is a fixed term appointment for 11 months.

starting in september 2012, this position will involve conducting the
bulk of the research activity within the framework of an epsrc (the
uk’s engineering and physical sciences research council) grant on
tensorial modeling of dynamical systems for gait and activity
recognition.

identity recognition by gait has been proposed as a novel behavioural
biometric, based on people’s distinctive gait pattern. nevertheless,
despite its attractive features, gait identification is still far from
being ready to be deployed in practice.  this is because in real-world
scenarios recognition is made extremely difficult by the presence of
nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination, clothing, and
others. however, a mathematical formalism general enough to
potentially address the fundamental issue of covariate factors in a
principled way exists under the name of multilinear/tensorial
analysis. its fundamental assumption is that the various factors
linearly mix to generate the measurements which we observe, in our
case the different walking gaits.

you will be responsible for:
- formulating an appropriate theoretical framework based on tensorial
analysis and metric learning of generative dynamical models
- selecting an adequate feature selection and extraction stage 
- implementing the approach by coding the different algorithms
involved in c++/matlab
- running tests on all the available benchmark datasets in gait
id/action recognition
- disseminating the results via publication at major, relevant conferences
- developing a dedicated website on the project.

you should have:
- a postdoctoral qualification in computer science or related fields,
or currently studying for a phd
- substantial research experience as a doctoral student in computer
vision or machine learning
- an adequate publication record in computer vision or machine learning
- the potential to conduct research independently
- coding proficiency in c++ and matlab

you will have the chance to collaborate with ph.d. students working on
cutting edge action recognition frameworks and be part of wider effort
on the subject, in the context of the oxford brookes vision group.

detailed list of phd themes:

theme 3.9: new design and implementation principles for variable impedance actuation
the department of advances robotics is currently one of the leading research institutes working in the development and integration of compliant actuators in robots.  series compliant actuators are increasingly being considered for actuation of a new generation of human centred robots. in human robot interaction and friendly robotics the introduction of springs in series with the electric motors provides to the robots passive compliance which is an extra measure of safety when interacting with humans. in robots operating in unstructured environments, such as humanoids, series elastic actuation provides instantaneous compliance to impulse loads protecting the mechanics and assisting the controller to absorb the impact. depending on the mechanical design and control method used, elastic components in the actuation may also allow for energy storage and recovery during gait or in high power actions such as throwing, kicking and jumping.  however, the introduction of springs in the robot's actuation alters the dynamics of the system significantly compared to that of a rigid robot and makes control more prone to oscillation. for this reason we also consider the addition of mechanical damping in parallel to the elastic components.
the goal of this phd will be the development of new design principles of variable impedance actuation with actively controlled variable mechanical compliance and damping/braking.  this research will investigate actuator power, stiffness and damping specifications for a range of foreseen applications which will be followed by a compete modeling of the system in terms of physical and electromechanical components. the developed actuators will be considered for anthropomorphic arms and for walking robots. research in the utility and control of the actuator will extend also toward energy storage and recovery in high power bursts such as throwing, kicking and jumping of anthropomorphic robots.

we are seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering, physical sciences or robotics. experience and competencies in cad mechanical design, modeling of electromechanical systems and knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>  and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>


theme 3.17:tactile sensing for robotic arms and dextrous hands
tactile sensing is an important area in haptics, teleoperation and robotic dexterous manipulation. manipulation of objects through dextrous multi degree of freedom robotic hands can only be efficiently performed if the interaction between the robotic hand and the object is effectively sensed.  currently research and development in tactile sensing is directed toward anthropomorphic sensors which attempt to match the sensing capabilities of the human skin and which resemble its mechanical properties.  this proves to be a great and exiting challenge.  the spatiotemporal sensing resolution of the human skin with thousands of mechanoreceptor organs in the finger pad areas and its large sensing range spanning from 10ths of milli newtons up to tens of newtons generate very demanding specifications for the design of anthropomorphic tactile sensors.
this research will focus on new tactile sensing technologies for robotic arms and dextrous robotic hands. it will involve research in both distributed pressure tactile sensing in the form of highly anthropomorphic/bio-mimetic compliant artificial skins and force sensing with semi-rigid skins in the form of high accuracy monolithic force/torque sensors.  toward artificial skins new sensor designs will be researched based on the current sensing technologies such as resistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive and other technologies. new methods will be sought for developing and integrating large populations of sensing elements into compliant materials suitable to operate as robotic skins.  the candidate will tackle the technological challenges in connectivity, power, and the signal processing of the distributed sensor. the candidate will work closely within a team of researchers and technicians toward developing working systems with a final goal to integrate tactile sensing in humanoid platforms such as the coman and c-cub (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) robots and in dextrous teleoperation applications in platforms such as the kuka lwr robot, the dlr hand, and the barretthand(tm).

the ideal candidate will be a talented individual with an electronics or mechatronics background and a strong performance in hardware design projects. the candidate should be willing to work in diverse areas, ranging from simulation (matlab, maple sim, etc), hardware design and software development (c++).
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>  and nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>.



theme 3.18:wearable haptic systems for dexterous teleoperation and virtual immersion
the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of virtual reality simulation or teleoperation procedure where the performed task requires the user to extensively engage his hand and fingers. in recent years the rapid improvements in hardware and software toward providing effective force/touch feedback has led to the development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various training simulators and teleoperation systems. however, in most of these instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered use are relatively poor. in addition these systems work as joysticks providing only point contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. furthermore, in existing wearable force feedback devices, such as in hand exoskeletons, high fidelity tactile feedback at the finger tip is currently absent. this means that teleoperation or simulation of tasks such as lifting a nail from a table or picking a wire from a bundle, where precision grips with tactile feedback at the fingertips are necessary, is not currently available.  to be of any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic interface.
this phd will concentrate on the development and integration of force and tactile feedback in a multi degree of freedom haptic system based on a semi-exoskeleton design incorporating a hand exoskeleton and a grounded haptic arm with large working, volume, high back-drivability and multimodal feedback capability. existing design directions in novel actuation systems, hand exoskeletons and tactile feedback systems developed in the department will form the foundation where this phd theme will build toward a highly integrated wearable system for precision dextrous tele-manipulation.

we are seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering physical sciences or robotics. experience and competencies in cad mechanical design and knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit. (mechanical design 50%, kinematics 30%, control 20%)

theme 3.19: development of a high performance haptic tele-manipulation system
haptic teleoperation systems using dexterous robotic hands offer potential benefits to many applications, for instance manipulation of objects/materials in hazardous or inaccessible environments (nuclear, space, chemical, etc), minimally invasive surgery and telemedicine. however, making these systems intuitive and transparent represents a big challenge for robotic research. this phd will focus on the development a high performance haptic teleoperation system for the dextrous manipulation of remote objects. the remote site of the system will consist of a compliant robotic arm integrated with a dexterous robotic hand and the operator site will consist of a hand exoskeleton with tactile feedback displays at the fingertips. the teleoperation system will work in an impedance control fashion. in that, the hand exoskeleton worn by the human operator will provide measurement of the human finger positions to be used for controlling the finger positions of the remote robotic hand. the interaction forces measured by the robotic hand when grasping remote objects will be presented to the operator's fingertips through the hand exoskeleton. tactile feedback from the remote interaction will also be presented at the operator's fingertips through the integrated tactile displays. within the framework of a teleoperation platform the candidate will work on algorithms for visual, haptic and tactile feedback, spatial mapping between the human hand and the robot hand and for addressing the time delay of the teleoperation system. to integrating tactile feedback in teleoperation alterative approaches to direct tactile sensing will be considered such as model based tactile feedback. a range of sensors will be considered for estimating the location, the shape and possibly material properties of the remote objects. in particular vision tracking and object recognition from the remote scene will assist in generating accurate models of the remote environment for application in haptic feedback.

interested candidates holding a master degree in mechanical / electrical engineering, computer science, or other related fields are invited to apply for admission. applicants should ideally have strong competencies in one or more of the followings areas: haptic interfaces, system modelling/ rigid body dynamics, robot control and c/c++ programming.

in haptics the simulation of touch is performed with force feedback/kinaesthetic devices which generate interaction forces to the user's hand and through tactile feedback devices which simulate small scale contact interactions with the skin. in virtual reality there is an increasing demand for powerful simulators able to provide kinaesthetic and tactile feedback to human operators through multi-fingered haptic devices such as hand exoskeletons and to simulate haptic interactions with virtual objects. this project aims at developing a high performance multimodal vr platform for grasping, manipulating and exploring virtual objects using a multi-fingered hand exoskeleton integrated with tactile feedback displays at the fingertips. the multimodal vr platform will allow the control of the hand exoskeleton based on a multi-point and soft-finger contact interaction and will create highly realistic simulations. multi-fingered interaction with rigid and also deformable objects will be considered for the development of the vr platform. for generating the appropriate control signals for the hand exoskeleton according to the forces obtained from the virtual interaction the mapping of the kinematics of the virtual hand, the user's hand and the exoskeleton will be addressed. tactile feedback to the user will be considered both for the simulation of contact through vibration and through high fidelity shape recreation with integrated tactile feedback arrays located at the exoskeleton's fingertips. to achieve the project's goals the successful candidate will be expected to develop novel algorithms for (1) precise collision detection between a virtual hand and rigid/deformable virtual objects, (2) generating the tactile and force feedback to the fingertips based on a multi-point and soft-finger contact and (3) controlling the hand exoskeleton and the fingertip tactile display hardware.
interested candidates holding a master degree in computer science, mechanical / electrical engineering, or other related fields are invited to apply for admission. applicants should ideally have strong competencies in one or more of the followings areas: hci (human computer interaction), haptic interfaces, robot control and c/c++ programming. any additional experience in robotics research will be a plus.

1407,2012,phd openings in humanoid robotics,"the humanoids and human centred mechatronics lab (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/) at the department of advanced robotics in the italian institute of technology iit (an english language institute, placed in genoa) has a number of fully funded phd openings (starting in january 2013) in the research areas of humanoid robotics and human centred mechatronics systems.  young scientists holding excellent first/master degrees in mechanical / electrical engineering, computer science, or other related fields are invited to apply for admission. applicants should be highly motivated and ready to carry out ambitious research programs. they should ideally have strong competencies in one or more of the followings areas: mechanism design, physical system modelling/ rigid body dynamics, robot control, matlab and c/c++ programming. any additional experience in robotics research will be a plus.
the successful candidates will be involved in research projects funded by the european union (amarsi: http://www.amarsi-project.eu/ and saphari: http://www.saphari.eu/). they will interact with several international research centres and universities and will contribute to the development and control of the next generation of humanoids robots and human centred mechatronics systems.

here is the description of three themes centered on walking, stabilization and motion planning for humanoid robots.
for a list of all the themes see annex a4 at http://www.studenti.unige.it/postlaurea/dottorati/xxviiiciclo/iiten

the deadline for application is september 21, 2012.


theme 3.10: haptic exploration for humanoid navigation with a compliant robot
tutor: dr nicolas perrin, dr nikos tsagarakis

humans are able to modify their usual strategy for locomotion in order to move in a cluttered environment without any visual information.
the goal of this phd research program is to perform this difficult task with a compliant humanoid robot. more precisely, we will study the problem of navigation in an unknown environment with a ""blind"" humanoid robot. this may require haptic exploration with the feet to find flat and stable surfaces, or arm motions to check for the absence of obstacles or on the other hand find safe contacts to increase balance.
the successful candidate will investigate various algorithms and multi-contact planning strategies in order to solve this problem in complicated environments. in a first phase, quasi-static motions might be considered, but trying to maximize the robot speed will ultimately be an objective of prime importance. because of their increased ability to absorb shocks, it is expected that passively compliant robots can perform blind navigation faster than other robots, and the successful candidate should try to demonstrate this hypothesis.
experiments will be made on the passively compliant coman platform (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) developed at the department of advanced robotics of the iit. solving this complex problem in a robust way is expected to have an impact far beyond the sole application of blind navigation.

requirements: the ideal candidate should have a degree in engineering or computer science (or equivalent), be highly motivated to work on robotic platforms and have very strong computer programming skills, including experience with c/c++ in the unix environment. good writing and communicating skills in english are essential.

for further details concerning this research project, please contact: nicolas.perrin at iit.it  or nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it.




theme 3.11: dynamic stabilization of biped robots based on imu data.

tutor: dr nicolas perrin, dr nikos tsagarakis

while well-known force/torque control methods can be applied to set a compliant equilibrium configurations for a biped robot whose feet are assumed to remain at a fixed position on the ground. things are much more complicated when the feet of the robot are expected to move, either because the robot is walking or because large external disturbances might require feet displacements.
the goal of this phd research program is to study the potential benefit of having an imu sensor fixed at the robot waist. in a first phase, the successful candidate will design and study control algorithms using imu feedback for the stabilization of a biped robot whose feet are not expected to move. for example, these control algorithms might only try to enforce a horizontal orientation of the robot waist at all time. the algorithms should be flexible enough to allow extensions in which the feet could move, and might take their inspiration in the simple control algorithms used for the stabilization of segway pts. in a second phase, various stepping strategies will indeed be considered and combined with the previously designed control algorithms to obtain a dynamic stabilizer that can perform various tasks such as push recovery or stabilization during walking with potential footstep modifications. experiments will be made on the coman platform (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) developed at the department of advanced robotics of the iit.

requirements: the ideal candidate should have a degree in engineering or computer science (or equivalent), knowledge in dynamics and control, be highly motivated to work on robotic platforms and have strong computer programming skills, including experience with c/c++ in the unix environment. good writing and communicating skills in english are essential.

theme 3.12: humanoid walking and motion planning: walking on uneven terrains, particulate surfaces and terrains with different stiffness properties.

tutors: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr nicolas perrin

despite the significant progress made in humanoid locomotion during the past decade most current humanoids still suffer from major problems related to dynamically equilibrated walking, stable walking and physical interaction with the environment. looking at humanoid locomotion developments it can also be observed that most of them have been performed on flat surfaces. this is a very ideal surface property compared to surfaces existing in human environments where stairs, inclined surfaces, small obstacles and even rough surfaces may exist. up to now, there are only a few effective demonstrations of walking and motion planning in this kind of environments.

a new humanoid robot (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) has been developed under the european fp7 project amarsi (htp://www.amarsi-project.eu/). this newly developed robot has compliant joint structures which will eventually enable us to obtain feasible jumping/running characteristics through the use of the natural system dynamics. in addition, it has 6 axis force/torque sensors at the ankles and the feet soles are also equipped with 5 point 1-axis force sensors to detect feet contact with the ground. such a sensory system created on the feet soles will permit exploration of walking on:

a)    uneven terrains and stepping over obstacles
b)    particulate solid surfaces consisting of particles of different size and density
c)    surfaces of different stiffness.

techniques will be developed to plan the motion and regulate both dynamic equilibrium and body/feet posture in order to achieve walking on uneven surfaces avoiding or stepping on obstacles with variable inclinations, on particulate surfaces such as sand or to pass through surfaces with different stiffness properties. these methods will take into account kinematics/dynamics and self-collision constraints while detection of the terrain properties will be assisted by rich sensory feedback from the feet of the humanoid. in particular, we will explore how to detect rough terrain/obstacle properties such as inclination and stiffness using the contact force sensors located on the sole of the feet. having determined the rough terrain characteristics, how the balance stability is affected when the robot is on this specific rough terrain will be evaluated and different control and trajectory planning methodologies will be developed to allow the humanoid to pass through different terrains while maintaining stability and balance.

requirements: the ideal candidate should possess strong background in physical system modeling and control, matlab and c/c++ programming.  knowledge on mechatronics hardware, fundamental robotics and rigid body dynamics is a plus.

the details of the phd position are as follows:

*** stream 1: machine learning, robot control and human-robot interaction (advanced robotics - prof. darwin caldwell)

** theme 3.1: developmental robotics and robot learning for agile locomotion of compliant humanoid robots 

** tutor:  dr petar kormushev, dr nikos tsagarakis 

developmental robotics offers a completely different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. for example, currently, the majority of bipedal walking robots use variants of zmp-based walking with largely simplified models of the robot dynamics. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot legs, the locomotion repertoire of current bipedal robots merely includes slow walking on flat ground or inclined slopes, and primitive forms of disturbance rejection. this is far behind from even a two-year old child.

the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving more agile locomotion. however, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of developmental robotics and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in developmental robotics.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

requirements: this is a multidisciplinary theme where the successful candidates should have strong competencies in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and good knowledge of robot kinematics and dynamics. the candidates should have top-class degree and a background in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. required technical skills: c/c++ and/or matlab. knowledge of computer vision is a plus.

1418,2012,postdoctoral research assistant in gait and activity recognition - oxford brookes university (fabio cuzzolin),"faculty of technology, design and environment
postdoctoral research assistant in gait and activity recognition
starting salary: £24,520 rising annually to £26,779

this is a fixed term appointment for 11 months.

starting in october 2012, this position will involve conducting the
bulk of the research activity within the framework of an epsrc (the
uk’s engineering and physical sciences research council) grant on
tensorial modeling of dynamical systems for gait and activity
recognition.

identity recognition by gait has been proposed as a novel behavioural
biometric, based on people’s distinctive gait pattern. nevertheless,
despite its attractive features, gait identification is still far from
being ready to be deployed in practice.  this is because in real-world
scenarios recognition is made extremely difficult by the presence of
nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination, clothing, and
others. however, a mathematical formalism general enough to
potentially address the fundamental issue of covariate factors in a
principled way exists under the name of multilinear/tensorial
analysis. its fundamental assumption is that the various factors
linearly mix to generate the measurements which we observe, in our
case the different walking gaits.

you will be responsible for:
-       formulating an appropriate theoretical framework based on tensorial
analysis and metric learning of generative dynamical models
-       selecting an adequate feature selection and extraction stage
-       implementing the approach by coding the different algorithms
involved in c++/matlab
-       running tests on all the available benchmark datasets in gait
id/action recognition
-       disseminating the results via publication at major, relevant
conferences and journals
-       developing a dedicated website on the project.

you should have:
-       a postdoctoral qualification in computer science or related fields,
or currently studying for a phd
-       substantial research experience as a doctoral student in computer
vision or machine learning
-       an adequate publication record in computer vision or machine learning
-       the potential to conduct research independently
-       coding proficiency in c++ and matlab

you will have the chance to collaborate with ph.d. students working on
cutting edge action recognition frameworks and be part of wider effort
on the subject, in the context of the oxford brookes vision group.

applicants should file a formal application by filling the application
form found here:

interviews will be conducted in early september.

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella

nowadays the packaging is one of the technology applied worldwide because all the goods exchanged (sold or bought) are packed. half of the study in this field is on the speed manufacturing that reached very good results for simple boxes; the complex carton, in the inverse, are far from reliable solutions and large part of this production is still by hands. despite this huge effort, till now few manipulators are built suitable for factories (as d-raps or archaps) and that demonstrates the difficult of this challenge.  in fact, the reconfigurability of the cartons not only requires dexterous manipulator, but for make competitive the device, even a deep  knowledge of the cartonboard. goal of this phd is to design and build a new reconfigurable device able to fold origami carton autonomously depending on the initial final shape. this mechanism will be useful for study the cartonboard behaviour during the folding and the new design of them. that means a virtual prototype of this device will be done in order to simulate the manipulation, so the best solution will be found quicker, because few physical prototyping will be necessary. so the study will be divided in two part: carton board mechanical properties investigation and carton folding manipulator design. the first one involves the experimental tests on carton and paper in order to determine the crease and panels stiffness. second one concerns the theory of the manipulation and hierarchy of the panel rotation. together will permit to simulate the physic modelling of origami carton folding. considering the small forces and torques used in these folding, the feedback in the control will be very complex because the measurement signal are always very weak compared to the noise given by the cartonboard dynamics (e.g. the backlashes or panel bending). the paten should be another goal of this study.
this work will be developed in strong collaboration with king's college of london, uk under supervision of prof. jian s. dai
requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in mechanics. the background must be in mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics. the ideal competencies should be in multibody simulation/finite element analysis and robot dynamics and control.

required technical skills: 50% mechanics, 25% control, 25% kinematics

theme 3.26: hyq and coman new design using the virtual prototyping

tutors: dr. ferdinando cannella,

number of available positions: 1
in the near future, hyq (http://www.iit.it/en/hydraulically-actuated-quadruped-hyq.html) and coman (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html) robots will run, but to face this challenge their structures must be very well designed to bear the stress and strain of foot/ground impact. the best way to do this task is to use the virtual prototyping design: multi-body simulations (mbs) and finite element modeling (fem). numerical simulation have become commonplace in recent years and is now the basis in the design of structures and mechanism. not all problems can be solved analytically with equations and therefore we have to use numerical methods to solve day-to-day engineering problems. mbs works on rigid body  and is useful to create models that will produce results that are closer to the physical dynamics. fem is so important that even introductory treatments of mechanics of materials should outline its principal features. thanks to this analysis, it can be obtained good predictions of the behavior of a robot bodies and the times of prototyping can be enormously reduced. joining these two numerical techniques, the dynamics and flexibility of the entire system is taken to account and the behaviour of the structure can be known more accurately. the best valuable advantage is that the obtained solutions are better than they could be foresee by anyone, because these methods take in account a lot of parameters that it is impossible for any human mind. goal of these phd is to apply mbs and fem analysis to the hyq and coman robots in order to develop new quadruped and/or humanoid features and shapes starting from the study of the existing models. for these reasons, we are looking for highly motivated candidate ables to work as part of an interdisciplinary team in the framework of funded research projects.
requirements: successful  candidate  must  have  a  degree in  mechanical  engineering or  civil engineering. good computing and multibody skills are also necessary for this positions. knowledge about some of the software as msc.adams, msc.nastran, msc.dytran, ansys/workbench, ls-dyna, modefrontier, matlab or octave will be taken in account.
this work will be developed under the supervision of dr. nikolaos tsagarakis and dr. claudio semini

theme 3.25: development of dynamic investigation test-rig autonomous in haptics (ditah) for detecting the neuropathy

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella

number of available positions: 1
touch and related capabilities, such as kinaesthesia, are probably the most underrated human abilities. most researches, in fact, have concentrated on the visual and audio aspects of the sensory systems, but touch in daily life plays a fundamental role in all our actions; losing part of this sensitivity causes a problem in accomplishing even simplest tasks. the uncomfortable condition increases with the increasing of peripheral neuropathy. therefore it is important to detect these diseases in the earliest stages, because in most cases it is impossible to recover, but it is possible only to slow them down or, in some cases, to stop them. current physical inspections lack in objectivity and comparison among results, because they depend on the doctor' sensitivity and on empiric tests; that leads to have a very low resolution scale of illness and to identify the peripheral neuropathies only when they are full-blown. the aim of this project is to add a new device to the screening in order to make it more objective, to reduce the threshold and to record the results; this will permit not only to detect the diseases in earliest stages but even to compare the follow-up inspections determining the neuropathy progression. this device will be full of sensors to measure all the anatomic and the biometric parameters (fingertip dimensions, skin elasticity, applied force, displacement, force, etc) in order to check the state of health of the patient thanks the touch sensitivity. to build the ditah (dynamic investigation test-rig autonomous in haptics) the study must proceed in two different fields: the first one is about the psychophysics and/or neuroscience, because experimental tests will be carried out for collecting data to define the performance of the device; moreover, analyzing these results a more accurate scale of peripheral neuropathy diseases will be determined; the second one concerns the test-rig building, so the electronics, control and the computer programming are necessary to create a new device that is suitable for clinical use. it must be very safe, user friendly and reliable to permit a very accurate patients screening.

this work will be developed in strong collaboration with università degli studi di brescia, at the clinica neurologica under supervision of prof. paolo liberini.



requirements: this project is open to two different phd candidates, one with more interest in psychophysics/neuroscience and the other in control/computer programming. the candidates will work within an international environment on the development and control of the ditah. we are ideally seeking candidates with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering, physical sciences or robotics.

theme 3.13: dynamic walking and running of compliant humanoid robots on rough terrain
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.
number of available positions: 1

the application of humanoids in the human environment requires the mobility of walking and running on the reconstructed terrain in contrast to a prepared and known lab environment. there are a plenty of existing methods, such as the zmp based pattern generation, which can provide dynamically feasible trajectories for walking and running on a flat ground. however, most of the methods are designed for the humanoid robots with stiff actuations. due to the high stiffness of the actuators, the capability of adapting the rough and uneven terrain is very limited. moreover, a more agile and dynamic movement requires a more compliant interaction with the environment in order to reduce the impacts. these essential demands can be solved by designing the smart mechanism that exploits the intrinsic compliance as the nature shows in biological land animals.

with the new compliant hardware and the task of walking on the rough terrain, there is a raising demand of a new control methodology that makes use of the physical compliance for smooth interaction and provides the feasible controllers to generate variety types of walking and running gaits. differ from the engineering approaches from which a lot of artificial constraints are unnatural imposed, such as the zmp method, the new research would investigate the results from the passive dynamic walkers and the nonlinearity of the step-to-step transitions. typically for humans, walking and running do not necessarily involve symmetric or periodic alternation of legs. the limit cycle approach investigates the cyclic gaits which demonstrate self-stability.  the proposed research topic will focus on the extraction of the fundamental principles of the limit cycle method previously applied on passive dynamic walkers (typically gravity powered walking). a number of methods for controlling the kinetic energy will be studied and further extend it to a more general principle for dynamic walking and running. the implementation and experimental validation will be finally conducted on the rough terrain. the research platform for testing the hypotheses is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.


theme 3.14: stabilization and balance control of the compliant humanoid robots
tutor: dr. zhibin li, dr. nikos tsagarakis.

while operating in human environment, the humanoid robots permanently have the risk of colliding with unexpected objects and falling. to tackle the collisions and prevent a fall are crucial regarding the safety for both humans and robots. the stabilization of the proposed research will focus on the passivity based compliance control to attenuate the undesired oscillations and movements caused by impacts during the robots’ interaction with the environment, especially for the robots with physical compliant materials.

the balancing control will investigate different strategies to maintain the equilibrium. for small and moderate disturbances, the robot could balance without taking steps. however, since the capability of keeping balance is limited given a fixed size of the support area, the robot must exploit other strategies such as taking steps when the increasing disturbance is able to topple the robot. the proposed research will develop the balance control using both the simplified model and a full body dynamics model. the feedbacks for the balance control will require the sensor fusion of a number of different signals, such as the linkage positions (proprioception), the reaction forces acting in feet (haptics) and the inertial measurement (inner ears). the algorithms are expected to be tolerant to parameter variations and robust to different types of disturbances (external pushes and terrain surface variations). the research platform for testing the algorithms is the series of the compliant humanoid robot coman.

candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in:
1. rigid body dynamics, mechanics;
2. classical and modern control theory;
3. programming skills (matlab, c/c++);
4. good english proficiency.

candidates are encouraged to send their cv prior to application. for further details concerning the research project, please contact: dr. zhibin li, email: zhibin.lixat iit.it; dr. nikos tsagarakis, email: nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it.

1461,2012,program for the iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012),"iros 2012 workshop on cognitive assistive systems (cas2012): closing the
action-perception loop
sunday october 7th 2012
vilamoura, algarve,  portugal 
url: http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/cas2012/

we gladly invite you to attend the cas2012 workshop...

it is becoming increasingly clear that future robotic systems will need to
exhibit sophisticated assistive capabilities, highly tuned and responsive
to the needs of human users. whether on autonomous platforms or within
personal computing systems, awareness of human intentions and requirements
will be an essential attribute of any robotic system aiming to be genuinely
useful. in essence, they will need to be capable of empathising with human
behaviour if they are to be truly assistive in the fullest sense of the
word.

realising such cognitive assistive systems (cas) will require advances
along the complete processing pipeline, from sensing through to learning
and interaction. for instance, sensing will need to be proactive,
anticipating user actions and environment changes to optimise data capture;
whilst learning will need to exploit knowledge gained from observation of
past actions and behaviours to predict likely human responses and reactions
under different scenarios. during task-performance, assistive systems need
to predict the perceptual changes that result as a consequence of human
actions. these are challenging tasks which are likely to require step
changes in current state of the art capability if they are to be addressed.

the aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from relevant
disciplines to exchange ideas and results on these and related tasks, as
well as on the form of existing and future cognitive assistive systems.
this will include those working in sensing, such as speech and vision,
machine learning and ai, human computer interaction, biomechanics, and on
systems and applications, including autonomous platforms, sensor networks
and wearable computing, for example. one area in which ca systems are
likely to have significant impact is in industrial manufacturing and
training, and applications in this area will be of particular interest for
this workshop.

1462,2012,research assistant in verification of autonomous systems at the university of bristol,"research assistant in verification of autonomous systems (ref. 17423)

based in the faculty of engineering hosted by the bristol robotics 
laboratory this is an exciting and challenging opportunity to join a 
multi-disciplinary research team working on a new project entitled 
""robust integrated verification of autonomous systems (riveras)"" funded 
by the engineering and physical sciences research council.

you will be developing novel techniques and methodologies that can be 
used to design autonomous intelligent systems that are verifiably 
trustworthy. this requires research at the leading edge of design 
verification, formal specification and autonomous system design, 
advancing and integrating the most promising techniques to arrive at a 
design-for-verification methodology that enables engineers to ensure 
that the strict safety requirement necessary for such systems are met. 
target application areas include safety critical systems such as robotic 
inspections of a nuclear power plant and space explorations e.g. on mars 
by a rover or a robotic aircraft, but also the next generation of clever 
consumer products with embedded intelligence and adaptability e.g. toys, 
gadgets and household appliances.

working in close collaboration with the riveras team to address these 
research challenges, you have a phd in either computer science, 
artificial intelligence, optimization and control for autonomous 
systems, robotics or a closely related field and have started to build 
up a publication record. knowledge of computer-aided verification and 
experience with formal or test-based verification methodologies as well 
as state-of-the-art verification tools is an advantage but by no means a 
must. most of all, you seek an intellectual challenge, are keen to learn 
and strive for excellence in research. you have excellent written and 
spoken communication skills and an ability to explain and share deep 
concepts and techniques with colleagues. you must have strong 
programming skills that enable you to quickly integrate software for 
robotic experiments. you enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team and 
have excellent self-motivation. we strongly encourage fresh phd 
graduates to apply.

the closing date for applications is 9.00am, 04 october 2012.
interviews are expected to be held towards the end of october 2012 with 
a start date as soon as possible but at the latest by january 2013.

school of electronic, electrical and computer engineering, university of 
birmingham, united kingdom*

we invite applications for a phd student to work in our new emote 
(embodied-perceptive tutors for empathy-based learning) project, funded 
by the european commission in the seventh framework programme (fp7). the 
project aims to design and evaluate a new generation of robotic tutors 
that have perceptive capabilities to engage in empathic interactions 
with learners in schools and home environments.

we are looking for an excellent student with a solid background in one 
or more of the following domains: artificial intelligence, pattern 
recognition, signal processing, human-computer interaction. interest in 
disciplines such as education, robotics, affective computing, 
intelligent tutoring systems, psychology and social sciences would be 
desirable. good programming skills are required. the candidate should 
have a strong bsc degree (at least a 2:1) or msc degree in computer 
science or related areas relevant to the phd topics.

the successful candidate will contribute to managing the research 
activities in the project, with a focus on designing approaches for 
learner modelling and investigating mechanisms to support personalised 
learning through robotic tutors. a key aspect of this research is the 
investigation of the role of pedagogical and empathic interventions in 
the process of engaging the learner and facilitating their learning 
progress with a robotic tutor. research activities will involve close 
collaboration with other researchers at the university of birmingham and 
other partners of the project in different european countries.

the post is available from december 2012/january 2013 for three years 
(starting date is negotiable) and is fully funded only for candidates 
with uk or eu nationality. the studentship will cover fees and a 
tax-free stipend up to £15,580 per annum.

the successful candidate will join the recently established hci centre, 
a joint venture between the school of electronic, electrical and 
computer engineering and the school of computer science of the 
university of birmingham. the centre takes a people-centred perspective 
on interaction and technology to lead the development of our 
understanding on how people interact with technologies, and how one 
transforms the other.

*emote project description*

significant work has been devoted to the design of artificial tutors 
with human capabilities with the aim of helping increase the efficiency 
achieved with a human instructor. yet, these systems still lack the 
personal, empathic and human elements that characterise a traditional 
teacher and fail to engage and motivate students in the same way a human 
teacher does. the emote project will design, develop and evaluate a new 
generation of artificial embodied tutors that have perceptive 
capabilities to engage in empathic interactions with learners in a 
shared physical space. overall, the emote project aims to (1) research 
the role of pedagogical and empathic interventions in the process of 
engaging the learner and facilitating their learning progress and (2) 
explore if and how the exchange of socio-emotional cues with an embodied 
tutor in a shared physical space can create a sense of connection and 
social bonding and act as a facilitator of the learning experience. this 
will be done across different embodiments (both virtual and robotic), 
allowing for the effect that such embodiment will have on engagement and 
empathy to be explored. further, the project will support the migration 
of the artificial tutors across different embodiments, to support 
students' learning in both formal and informal settings. to ground the 
research in a concrete classroom scenario, the emote project will 
develop a showcase in the area of geography, focusing on environmental 
issues. this will enable tutors to be tested in real world school 
environments in different european countries. in order to achieve these 
objectives, the emote consortium will bring together experts to carry 
out interdisciplinary research on affect recognition, learner models, 
adaptive behaviour and embodiment for human-robot interaction in 
learning environments, grounded in psychological theories of emotion in 
social interaction and pedagogical models for learning facilitation.

to apply for the position, please send the following documents to dr.

the successful candidate will conduct research on haptics -- the science and engineering of touch and movement -- within a new laboratory devoted haptics and creative technologies at drexel.  in our lab, we study mechanisms underlying human touch sensation and design novel touch-feedback and multimodal interfaces.  examples include wearable haptic displays, virtual reality touch surfaces, or tangible robotic interfaces for the hand.  the laboratory is affiliated with the new expressive and creative interaction technology center (excite) based at drexel, http://drexel.edu/excite/

candidates should be highly motivated and have a prior degree(s) in a relevant field (e.g., engineering, physics, neuroscience, acoustics, interactive technologies, etc).  hands-on knowledge, experience or at least strong affinity for one or more areas of engineering and technology related to our activities (e.g., solid modeling, fab/rapid prototyping, robotics, mechatronics / sensing, material engineering, biomechanics) would be a further benefit, and project management skills would be a positive.

a number of possible research topics is available, including:

theme 1) touching the third-dimension: artificial touch feedback for novel touch screen displays capable of rendering sensations such as shape and softness

theme 2) wearable haptics: reproducing virtual touch and movement sensations via wearable haptic interfaces for the skin; novel approaches based on cross-modal perceptual synergies

theme 3) walking on virtual ground: haptic feedback and interaction with computationally augmented floor surfaces

theme 4) from seeing to feeling: neuroscientific bases of active touch and vision and cross-modal interactions between them

theme 5) living touch: new electroactive materials for touch sensing and haptic actuation

drexel university is a leading national research university in the vibrant urban setting of philadelphia, usa, with strengths in areas including engineering, biomedicine, and multimedia.  drexel is rapidly growing in stature, and is regarded as one of the top ""up-and-coming"" universities in the usa, ranking #3 nationally in this category (us news, 2012).

team:
the mean research objectives of interactive robotics group at uvsq is to
address open issues in the field of safety interaction, cooperation between
active systems and passive systems, redundancy and improvement of the energy
consumption of interactive robots.
our team has been investigated since 2005 a new actuating technology named
""integrated electro-hydraulic actuator"". the ieha's principle is based on
the possibility of producing the hydraulic power independently for each
joint in the robotic systems.
a humanoid robot named hydroïd based on ieha technology is under
development. ieha system was is covered with an international patent
(wo2009118366). three other internationals patents were achieved on the
hydroïd's mechanisms ( wo2009135694) ( wo2009144320) and ( wo2009147243).
mission:
context: although, many lower extremity prosthesis devices have been
realized during the last years, the development of the «perfect» prosthesis
is still an open question. transtibial and transfermoral amputees need
sophisticated prosthesis to make them regaining walking normal movement.
furthermore, we believe that, today, a suitable prosthesis must optimize the
used energy during the walk, and a comfortable connection with the living
part of the leg.
subject: the objective of this work is to build a testing machine for
transtibial and transfermoral prosthesis. the needed machine must be able to
reproduce the same dynamic and kinematics conditions applied on the
prosthesis during the normal use. special attention have to be paid for the
instrumentation of the contact surface between machine and the tested
prosthesis.
analyzing transfered force via this surface, will help us optimizing the
prosthesis's connection to the living leg.
a simulator of the machine need to be built under dynamic simulation
software like adams. a low-level and high-level control have to be done to
ensure the functionality of the system.
the hydroïd’s hip mechanism can play key role on the production of the
movements in this machine. hydraulic actuation helping production of high
force, hence the possibility to test a variety of prosthesis with a variety
walk speed and profile.
the scientific results of this work will be, the definition of the
theoretical and the technical criteria needed to build optimal transfermoral
and transtibial prosthesis.
candidates profile:
candidates, phd graduated, should justify full knowledge in theoretical
developments and in experimental techniques for mechatronic systems design.
experiences in the fields of hydraulic systems, dynamic simulations and
control well be greatly appreciated for this application. according to
project's context, the candidate is expected to contribute to the management
of the project, co-supervise thesis works and attend the meetings with
partners. the ability to work autonomously, creativity, and team spirit are
imperative.
proposal: post doc contract salary range: > 25,000 and < 35,000€ annual
gross. duration: 12 months, renewable (from first 2013).

1496,2012,"post-doctoral position in medical robotics / computer vision, strasbourg, france","*the university of strasbourg (france) offers a 24 months post-doctoral 
position in the field*
*of medical robotics / computer vision, on the following project :

*""*event detection in non-vascular interventional radiology*""

the project aims at developing guiding and monitoring tools for medical 
procedures in interventional radiology, by combining computer vision and 
haptic feedback.

/keywords/: real-time registration, computer vision, fluoroscopy, haptics

the proposed project consists in developing visual/haptic supervision in 
non-vascular interventional radiology. the work will be applied to 
cement injection in vertebroplasty procedures. vertebroplasty is a 
minimally invasive interventional technique, which improves the 
treatment of patients enduring vertebrae fractures due to osteoporosis 
or bones tumours. it consists in injecting orthopaedic cement through a 
needle inserted in the vertebra cavity. the injection is monitored in 
real-time using an x-ray fluoroscope in order to continuously control 
cement diffusion. a solution for limiting the radiologist exposure to 
x-rays consists in developing robotized tools to inject the cement at a 
distance.we have already developed a master-slave system, which provides 
haptic feedback to the user for assisting such gestures. an ambitious 
project now consists in augmenting the radiologist perception rather 
than just providing injection efforts feedback. this post-doctoral 
project hence focuses on developing monitoring and guidance tools for 
improving cement injection, especially for allowing real-time detection 
of cement leakage outside the vertebra cavity, which can lead to embolism.

we propose to automatically detect cement leakage by coupling analysis 
of fluoroscopic images and monitoring of injection pressure. the 
objective is to make the detection as fast as possible but also to limit 
the risk of non detection which could result from a bad positioning of 
the imaging device. data fusion between image detection and pressure 
measurement can be obtained in different manners. image detection could 
be correlated with pressure variation measurements to confirm 
abnormality detection. conversely the point of view could be modified 
when pressure changes are detected but not coupled with visible leakage 
in the images. detection will be coupled to a haptic strategy, which 
will allow to stop or to adapt cement injection to make the gesture safer.

*working environment. candidate profile and funding*
the candidate will work at the medical robotic platform of the lsiit 
laboratory located at the ircad in the centre of strasbourg. he/she will 
have access to siemens interventional ct-scanner and siemens zeego 
robotized fluoroscopy system, both available at the mix-surg ihu (joint 
institute of hospital and university). the candidate shall have a 
succeeding research experience in computer vision, preferably in the 
medical context. knowledge and experience in automatic control, robotics 
or signal processing will be beneficial. inclination for experimental 
work and strong background in c/c++ programming are mandatory.

the project is supported by the idex (excellence initiative of the 
university of strasbourg) and a funding is provided for 24 months. 
monthly gross salary is about 2500 euros.

http://www-list.cea.fr/

job description:

based on its long experience in teleoperation (see [1]), the interactive
robotics laboratory (lri) of the cea list is pursuing research in the field of
operator gesture assistance. for that purpose, the laboratory developed a
robotic 3d supervisor in order to realize interactive physical simulations and to prepare missions. if the simulation is well suited to mission planning, 3d supervision is of interest only if the model and the location of the simulated environment accurately reflect reality.
various works within the lri and more generally within the cea list / diasi
participated in refining cad model parts using vision or force sensing (autonomous or supervised methods). this allows to locate the robot in its
environment and thus to assist the operator in manipulation or grasping tasks.
the main objectives of this post-doc are: 
1. to evaluate the existing localization methods, 
2. to contribute to the improvement of these methods, if necessary, 
3. to introduce a mixed approach of localization using vision and effort.

to do this, the candidates will have at his disposal experimental robotic means and software platforms for vision refinement and virtual reality, coming from different laboratories of cea list diasi (computer vision laboratory http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm, virtual reality laboratory
http://www.kalisteo.fr/lsi/en).
the post-doc will work in collaboration with laboratories mentioned above. the fields of application foreseen are autonomous manipulation, as well as
teleoperation and comanipulation.

phd opening, design and control continuum robots for minimal invasive surgical applications, ku leuven, belgium

the department of mechanical engineering at the university of leuven (ku leuven), belgium, is pleased to offer a fully
funded phd scholarship to ""design and control continuum robots for minimal invasive surgical applications"". the successful applicant will
receive a phd scholarship for 4 years.

phd topic:
recent efforts in robotics and automation research have fostered the development of a wide variety of bio-inspired snake-like continuum robots. miniature continuum robots can access confined spaces and, thanks to their compliance, follow complex trajectories exchanging limited forces with the surroundings. these properties explain the appeal of these robots in surgical applications and minimal invasive surgery in particular, where critical tasks are to be executed within the delicate and complex environment of the human body.

compared to rigid robots, precise position and force control of these compliant robots is much more involved. it calls for an integrated approach combining accurate robot proprioception (self-awareness) with improved exteroception and 3d reconstruction of the robot's complex, deformable and often dynamic environment. by looking at new mechanisms for actuation, sensing and control, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and control over the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings. the conducted research will be applied on cardiovascular robotic catheter-based interventions within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.

title: phd position in advanced modeling



the institute of machine tools and manufacturing, at eth http://www.iwf.mavt.ethz.ch/index_en is seeking a ph.d. researcher in the area of machine design, precision engineering and control.



problem statement

in the sub-micron range motion systems have to satisfy strong specifications in a plurality of aspects. accuracy requirements in the nanometre-level, dynamic specifications in tens of g, but also economic target values have thoroughly to be met at the same time. for this reason, the development of sub-micron motion systems constantly expands to the borders of feasibility imposed by physical laws, this in order to allow full exploitation of the principles of precision engineering. for this task dedicated simulation represents an enabling mean for the development of future generations of these dedicated mechanisms. the modeling of corresponding systems requires the fusion of mechanical, thermal, electric, metrology and control disciplines in order do obtain the properties of the systems under investigation.



scientific objectives

the scientific focus of the thesis can be outlined as:

""advanced modeling of static and dynamic behaviors in complex machines""



the work will cover precision engineering in the nanometer range for high acceleration and high accuracy. this involves:

  1) elaboration of an adequate actuation system

  2) selection of an applicable metrology and control strategy

  3) realization of a prototype and assessment of properties for validation

  4) deduction of a procedure to transform system requirements of sub-micron motion systems into the design of these systems



organisation of the thesis

the selected ph.d. student will work at eth, under an employment contract with the company etel, which he will visit regularly during the three years of thesis.

content of the thesis: system analysis, modeling, actuation, metrology, design, simulation

requirements:          interest to work in a cutting edge, industry-related topic



applicants should send a cover letter briefly describing their background and career plans, a cv, and the names and contact

information for at least three references. the position is open immediately. these documents should be submitted as pdf attachments to dr. sascha weikert: weikert at inspire.ethz.ch<mailto:weikert at inspire.ethz.ch>"
1549,2012,phd studentship on belief and uncertainty theory - dec 5 2012,"the department of computing and communications technologies at oxford
brookes university is pleased to announce that it is able to offer a
doctoral bursary to a new phd student in for full time study
commencing in january 2013. the successful applicant will have course
fees waived and will be awarded a bursary of £10,000 per annum for
three years (with no inflation increase).

the phd project will be focus on decision making and estimation. these
are central problems in most applied sciences, as both people and
machines need to make inferences about the state of the external
world, and take appropriate actions.
traditionally, the (uncertain) state of the world is assumed to be
described by a probability distribution over a set of alternative,
disjoint hypotheses.

sometimes, however, as in the case of extremely rare events (e.g., a
volcanic eruption), few statistics are available to drive the
estimation. part of the data can be missing. furthermore, under the
law of large numbers, probability distributions are the outcome of an
infinite process of evidence accumulation, drawn from an infinite
series of samples: in all practical cases, instead, the available
evidence only provides some sort of constraint on the unknown
probabilities governing the process. all these issues have led to the
recognition of the need for a coherent mathematical theory of
uncertainty.

shafer’s theory of belief functions, in particular, allows us to
express partial belief by providing lower and upper bounds to
probability values. it is appealing because it addresses all the above
mentioned issues; its rationale is neat and simple; it is a
straightforward generalization of probability theory; it does not
require abandoning the notion of event. the widespread influence of
uncertainty at different levels explains why belief functions are
being increasingly applied to fields as diverse as robotics, fault
analysis, decision making, sensor fusion, machine vision, and many
more.

mathematically, a belief function is a random set, i.e. a probability
distribution on the power set (the collection of all subsets).
equivalent alternative interpretations can be given in terms of
compatibility relations, inner measures, and sum functions. however,
the necessary mathematical tools for prediction and estimation in this
framework have only partially been developed yet, due to their
inherent complexity: this is the case, in particular, for the
generalization of the classical total probability theorem to belief
functions.

the aim of this studentship is to study the mathematical properties of
belief functions, and give a contribution towards the development of
crucial tools such as the total belief theorem.

produce the following key results: (i) robots capable of
storing experiences in their memory in terms of multi-level
representations connecting actuator and sensory
experiences with meaningful high-level structures,
(ii) methods for learning and generalising from experiences
obtained from behaviour in realistically scaled real-world
environments, (iii) robots demonstrating superior robustness
and effectiveness in new situations and unknown
environments using experience-based planning and
behaviour adaptation. the project developments will be
integrated and demonstrated on a pr2 robot, from willow
garage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a three year phd student position in
computer science at örebro university,  sweden .  the research area is
artificial intelligence and robotics, with special emphasis on
planning human-aware robot behavior.  the work will be performed in
the context of the eu project monarch.  application deadline: january
15, 2013.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the student will be to perform world-class research
at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
specifically on the topic of planning human-aware robot behavior.  the
student will create, implement and test new techniques to allow a
robot, or team of robots, to generate plans to perform given tasks
that involve the interaction with humans.  what is new compared to
traditional planning is that these plans must ensure that the robot's
behavior complies with a set of social norms and social roles, which
may depend on the interaction context.

the research will be motivated by, guided by, and validated in a
specific application scenario: robots that interact with children in a
hospital, in order to entertain them or to participate in educational
activities.  depending on the context, robots may play different roles
and they may engage in different social relations with the children,
following different social norms.  for instance, robots may be
watchful guardians in some situations, or companion players in others.
the human-aware planning techniques developed in this research project
will take the social context, norms and roles into account, and
regulate the robots' behavior accordingly.

the successful candidate will be employed as phd student with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  he or she will
work within the local monarch team at örebro university, but will also
collaborate with the other european partners in the monarch project,
both remotely and through physical meetings and research visits.  a
limited amount of teaching may also be part of the phd student's
duties.

about the monarch project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

monarch (multi-robot cognitive systems operating in hospitals) is a
european union fp7 project.  the overall aims of monarch are (i) the
development of a novel framework to model mixed human-robot societies,
and (ii) its demonstration using a network of heterogeneous robots and
sensors, in the pediatric area of an oncological hospital.  it will
handle uncertainties introduced by people and robots, generate natural
interactions, and engage in edutainment activities.  the framework
developed in monarch will map concepts in social sciences into social
skills, group behaviors, and human-robot interaction, using learning
methodologies and decision-theoretic principles.

the expected outcomes of monarch are (i) an operational system able to
interact with people in a natural way, (ii) novel results on key
properties of networked robot systems, and (iii) guidelines to
translate the system to applications in hospital environments, and
further scenarios sharing similarities with them, e.g., kindergarten,
and personal assistance to elderly at home.

the monarch consortium is formed by nine top-level european
institutions and companies: the instituto superior técnico ( portugal ),
örebro university ( sweden ), universidad carlos iii ( spain ), instituto
português de oncologia de lisboa ( portugal ), ydreams robotics
( portugal ), selftech ( portugal ), idmind ( portugal ), école
polytechnique fédérale de lausanne (switzerland), and university of
amsterdam (the netherlands).

1580,2012,phd studentship in belief theory - oxford brookes university - extended to january 15 2013,"the department of computing and communications technologies at oxford
brookes university is pleased to announce that it is able to offer a
doctoral bursary to a new phd student in for full time study
commencing in january 2013. the successful applicant will have course
fees waived and will be awarded a bursary of £10,000 per annum for
three years (with no inflation increase).

the phd project will be focus on decision making and estimation. these
are central problems in most applied sciences, as both people and
machines need to make inferences about the state of the external
world, and take appropriate actions.
traditionally, the (uncertain) state of the world is assumed to be
described by a probability distribution over a set of alternative,
disjoint hypotheses.

sometimes, however, as in the case of extremely rare events (e.g., a
volcanic eruption), few statistics are available to drive the
estimation. part of the data can be missing. furthermore, under the
law of large numbers, probability distributions are the outcome of an
infinite process of evidence accumulation, drawn from an infinite
series of samples: in all practical cases, instead, the available
evidence only provides some sort of constraint on the unknown
probabilities governing the process. all these issues have led to the
recognition of the need for a coherent mathematical theory of
uncertainty.

shafer’s theory of belief functions, in particular, allows us to
express partial belief by providing lower and upper bounds to
probability values. it is appealing because it addresses all the above
mentioned issues; its rationale is neat and simple; it is a
straightforward generalization of probability theory; it does not
require abandoning the notion of event. the widespread influence of
uncertainty at different levels explains why belief functions are
being increasingly applied to fields as diverse as robotics, fault
analysis, decision making, sensor fusion, machine vision, and many
more.

mathematically, a belief function is a random set, i.e. a probability
distribution on the power set (the collection of all subsets).
equivalent alternative interpretations can be given in terms of
compatibility relations, inner measures, and sum functions. however,
the necessary mathematical tools for prediction and estimation in this
framework have only partially been developed yet, due to their
inherent complexity: this is the case, in particular, for the
generalization of the classical total probability theorem to belief
functions.

the aim of this studentship is to study the mathematical properties of
belief functions, and give a contribution towards the development of
crucial tools such as the total belief theorem.

1591,2012,three postdoctoral research fellowships in intelligent mobile robotics,"we are looking for up to three postdoctoral research fellows to work on a new fp7-funded project strands ""spatio-temporal representations and activities for cognitive control in long-term scenarios"". strands will develop new technologies to allow mobile robots to acquire and use semantic maps of indoor spaces that capture not just spatial information (walls, doors etc.), but also the spatio-temporal structure of the dynamics which change such spaces (e.g. human activities with objects). to do this, these robots must be able learn and operate reliably in long-term deployments (from weeks to months of autonomous activity). our robots will be tested over long-term operation in real-world care and building security applications.

strands is coordinated by the intelligent robotics lab (irlab, http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/go/irlab) in the school of computer science at the university of birmingham, uk. as a member of the strands team you will be working with five other leading eu research groups and two industrial partners. you will work as part of a team of six researchers on strands at birmingham, and around 30 researchers in strands as a whole. the work will be performed in the world-class research environment provided by the irlab, alongside exceptional researchers on national and eu projects, including two further new eu projects starting in early 2013.

the challenging tasks to be undertaken at birmingham in strands include learning qualitative spatial representations of indoor environments; planning the sequence of observations a mobile robot should make to learn and recognise activities (i.e. active spatio-temporal mapping); and the integration of motivation, learning and temporal behaviour planning capabilities into a rich architecture for long-term robot perception and action.  applicants are be expected to play a lead role creating original solutions to one or more of these problems, with exact responsibilities being decided on appointment depending on interest and experience. 

to apply, you should have completed a phd in ai, robotics or a related discipline. you should ideally have expertise in one of ai planning, decision theoretic planning, view planning, object search, qualitative spatial reasoning or probabilistic robotics more generally. you should have a high level of analytical ability and computational skills, including programming and knowledge of standard robotics software.

the posts are available from april 1st 2013 for up to 48 months. appointments will be made at the appropriate salary grade based on qualifications and experience. salaries range from £27,854 a year up to £44,607 a year, with potential progression to £50,186. 

informal enquiries may be made to project coordinator dr nick hawes (n.a.hawes at cs.bham.ac.uk) and dr jeremy wyatt (j.l.wyatt at cs.bham.ac.uk) in the school of computer science. please mark your email “strands fellowship enquiry”.

1594,2012,"two postdoctoral fellowships in long-term robot autonomy at university of lincoln, uk","the university of lincoln is seeking to appoint two new postdoctoral
research fellows (fixed term for 4 years) to join the recently established
centre for autonomous systems (l-cas). the centre is internationally
recognised for its research in sensing, mapping, and control for autonomous
robotic systems, and currently comprises 6 faculty staff and 14
post-graduate researchers. the successful candidates will be employed as
part of a european collaborative project, involving six academic institutes
and two industrial partners across four european countries.

the project aims to enable robots to achieve robust and intelligent
behaviour in human environments through adaptation to, and the exploitation
of, long-term experience. the approach is based on understanding 3d space
and how it changes over time, from milliseconds to months. the project will
develop novel approaches to extract quantitative and qualitative
spatio-temporal structure from sensor data gathered during months of
autonomous operation. the project will also develop control mechanisms
which exploit these structures to yield adaptive behaviour in highly
demanding, real-world security and care scenarios.

one postdoctoral research fellowship is focussed in the area of long-term
3d mapping for enabling activity and scene understanding by mobile robots.
 primary tasks include developing novel algorithms and approaches for
enabling the acquisition, maintenance and refinement of 3d maps over long
periods of time (the term “4d” is used to indicate 3d mapping over extended
time periods), while also understanding and modelling the environment
dynamics to enable prediction of likely future states. additional tasks
include integrating 4d mapping with lifelong learning about objects,
persons and activities and cognitive control of robots. for further
information and online application forms goto
http://jobs.lincoln.ac.uk/vacancy.aspx?ref=mht209

the other fellowship is focussed in the area of behaviour generation and
control to facilitate life-long learning of activities and dynamic scenes
by autonomous mobile robots. the primary tasks related to this fellowship
include the development of novel approaches enabling the robot to actively
explore its dynamic environment in order to complete and verify knowledge
in task- and curiosity-driven ways, including the integration of multiple
abilities and information sources into the autonomous robotic system.
additional tasks include the development of software framework extensions
for the management, access and retrieval of acquired information during
long-term operation. for further information and online application forms
