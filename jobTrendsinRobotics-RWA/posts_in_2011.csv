desiging light smart camera for networking

lasmea (laboratory of sciences and materials for electronics and 
automation) is a joint research laboratory between cnrs and university 
blaise pascal. it has 120 researchers and phd students.
in our research group gravir(group automation, vision and robotics), 
lasmea is doing research in the field of robotics, computer vision and 
multi-sensor perception. in the last area, we are developing hardware 
and software architectures for embedded perception, particularly smart 
cameras.
this potential research activity has involved our research group in many 
projects and given us opportunity to build strong industrial and 
academic partnerships. this job is offered by anr cogiro project.

the objective of cogiro project is the design and control of robots with 
large cable sizes (greater than 15 meters). it is also necessary to 
measure various geometric parameters of mechanical assembly. this is 
achieved by using vision because of its many advantages. but due to the 
big size of mechanical structure, it can't be achieved by using a single 
camera. so we decided to use a network of ""smart cameras"" to pre-process 
the flow of images, as a result not sending the relevant information.

in the ""smart cameras"" team, main responsibility of the selected 
candidate will be to support the specifications, then design single 
camera unit which will be duplicated.

• to specify the internal architecture and design of smart camera based 
on reconfigurable logic (fpga, cpld),
• to provide the specifications in terms of input/output of camera to 
ensure complete integration into the final prototype,
• make sure to interface your work with others work involved in the project,
• to organize demonstration with different partners.

candidate should have electronics engineering (or equivalent) with 2 to 
4 years experience in successfully developing electronic boards or have

915,2011,visual pattern recognition / neural network rennaissance / jobs in vision-based robotics,"many future robots will depend on vision. recently our neural computer  
vision team collected a string of 1st ranks in the following visual  
pattern recognition competitions and benchmarks:

1. online traffic sign recognition competition, u. bochum (1st & 2nd  
rank; 1.02% error rate, january 2011).
2. norb object recognition benchmark, nyu, 2004. new record (2.53%  
error rate) in january 2011 [1].
3. cifar-10 object recognition benchmark, u. toronto, 2009. new record  
(19.51% error rate) in january 2011 [1].
4. mnist handwritten digit recognition benchmark, nyu, 1998. new  
record (0.35% error rate) in 2010, tied in january 2011 [1].
5.-7. old news: three connected handwriting recognition competitions  
at icdar 2009, all won by multi-dimensional lstm recurrent neural  
networks.

none of 1-7 requires the traditional sophisticated computer vision  
techniques developed over the past six decades or so. instead, we use  
supervised feedforward or recurrent neural networks with many non- 
linear processing stages. gpus speed up learning by a factor of up to  
50. no need for unsupervised pre-training, which is a bit depressing,  
as we have developed unsupervised learning algorithms for two  
decades.  nevertheless, we think our results are contributing to a  
second neural network rennaissance (the first one happened in the  
1980s and early 90s). most recent paper:

rehabilitation 

project:
inria is the french national institute for research in computer science 
and control. the institute's strategy closely combines scientific 
excellence and technology transfer.
demar project's research interests are centered on the human sensory 
motor modeling, including muscles, sensory feedbacks, and neural motor 
networks. final goal of this team is oriented towards the development of 
advanced neuroprotheses to restore deficient functions.
http://www.lirmm.fr/demar/

research direction:
identification of biomechanical dynamics and muscle dynamics for 
neurologically damaged patient is already challenging as the system 
response can drastically vary depending on the degree of the patient 
deficiencies. in fes (functional electrical stimulation), movement 
synthesis and control are still a challenging task due to the complexity 
of whole body dynamics computation and the nonlinearity of stimulated 
muscle dynamics. one of the challenge concerns the feedback (torque, 
emg, joint angle) that can be used to control joint angle, torque or 
stiffness. moreover, control strategies have to be designed in order to 
be performed on portable architecture and tuned through advanced 
modeling and simulation.
in order to obtain stimulation patterns for a given movement 
corresponding to current patient posture condition, both off-line 
optimization for movement synthesis and online closed control are needed.
 in this context, the goal of this phd work is to study the 
optimization-based motion synthesis and real-time control framework 
which can generate stimulation patterns from the pre-computed motion 
synthesis database. motion capture system together with the estimation 
of the center of mass would be used to assess the strategies. this work 
aims at the development of automatic method to establish deficient limb 
stability in computer-aided rehabilitation.

caris lab – department of mechanical engineering

multimodal experience – muxlab – department of computer science

*university of british columbia, vancouver, canada*

professors elizabeth croft (mech) and karon maclean (cs)



caris lab and muxlab are seeking applications for two one-year (each
renewable for a second year) postdoctoral fellowships at the university of
british columbia in mechanical engineering and computer science in
vancouver, canada, *commencing may 1, 2011,* or as soon as possible
thereafter.

* *

*background: *this project exploits an emerging paradigm-shift for
manufacturing systems, which relies on taking robots “out of the cage” and
developing intelligent robotic assistants that can collaborate both directly
and physically with human co-workers in their tasks as part of the
production team. our advances will be driven by a primary understanding of
the support needs of workers in advanced manufacturing plants, and
implemented using new technologies and methods generated by both the
research team and our industrial partner, a major user and innovator of
large-scale manufacturing, assembly and automation.  our results will be
deployed, tested and evaluated on a unified platform for industry-identified
representative challenge tasks.



*project descriptions: *the two individuals will work on two coordinated
efforts: in topic 1 to assess, design and then integrate our new hri
techniques into the manufacturing process, and in topic 2 to innovate and
evaluate the novel low-level techniques themselves.



*topic 1: robot-assistant-in-manufacturing task design.  *the successful
candidate will be responsible for user studies and evaluations validating
the human-robot interaction in command/control, physical proximity of the
robotic assistant, and situational awareness needs and adequacy. working
closely and often in-situ with the industry partner, this includes (a)
interaction specifications from a systems view of the robotic assistant -
when is it useful, what is the context, and how does it affect the way
people work?  (b) evaluation methodology choice and execution throughout the
requirements, development and validation design cycle; and (c) research
questions such as “appropriate-modality” communication: how do we use
multiple modalities to effectively code a “message” in a given situation?

* *

*topic 2: communication loop design. *the successful candidate will be
responsible for the design, implementation and demonstration of the
communication loop between a robot and human, utilizing observed human cues
and robot feedback signals.  they will also supervise student working on
sub-projects related to cue recognition and transmission, robot
teach-by-showing, and robot control architecture for implicit communication
behaviour.



both individuals will take a leadership role, and assist in the supervision
of graduate and undergraduate students working on the project. the two
individuals will collaborate closely with one another, as well as with
certain offsite members of the larger team.

* *

*application criteria: *successful candidates will have completed ph.d.
research in computer science (hci, hri), mechanical/ mechatronics
engineering, electrical engineering, or a comparable discipline(s). both
need at least a general background in hci, experience in user study design
and execution, evidence of independent work, strong team skills, and
excellent communication abilities. in addition, he or she will have one and
ideally more of the following skills or background experience, demonstrated
by a corresponding publication record. the criteria will vary somewhat for
the two roles (controls experience is weighted more heavily for topic 2, and
deeper experience in hci including qualitative methods more important for
topic 1):

             - hands-on experience working with mechatronic/robotic systems


             - robotics and controls

             - familiarity with industrial manufacturing environments

             - task and workflow analysis methods

             - human attentional processing

             - iterative design and prototyping



*to apply: *please send the following information to
mux-postdoc-recruiting at cs.ubc.ca:

             - a brief letter of application, clarifying the projects
area(s) of interest and fit to the area(s)

             - a curriculum vitae which includes full contact information

             - list of publications with links to pdf-versions of the three
most relevant publications

             - three reference letters (sent separately)

*please use subject line “hri postdoc: <applicant name>” for all components.
*complete applications that are received by *april 1, 2011* will be given
priority.

a term-based research assistant professor position is available immediately
to work on an onr yip sponsored project: ""energy efficient swimming
mechanism: an inspiration from micro-scale biological systems"".

for swimming micro-organisms in low nutrient environments, their flagella
spend a significant percentage of the total available energy to budget on
movement.  it is believed that a high energy efficiency of swimming was
selected over the course of evolution.  however, it is not clear how
micro/nano-scale dynamics, control and morphology of the flagella may
contribute to the overall system performance.

the goal of this research is to learn micro-organisms’ design principles of
energy efficient swimming and robust attachment mechanisms, and employ the
principles learned from biology for innovation in propulsion system design.
though focusing on fundamental science, this research will pursue prototype
bio-inspired propulsion device development.

    phd researcher games and virtual worlds (1,0 fte)


job description

the research project 'algorithms for manipulation planning
with imperfect parts and inaccurate manipulators' is funded
by the netherlands organisation for scientific research (nwo).

industrial automation systems must rely on simple manipulators
and modest sensing capabilities to be reliable and inexpensive.
research of the past decade shows that systems based on such
components are amenable to systematic analysis and design.

a major obstacle to practical application is that existing
results assume perfectly-shaped parts and manipulators that
operate with infinite precision, while real parts are
manufactured to tolerances and real manipulators are subject
to errors. the goal of this project is to tackle this severe
idealization and design algorithms for planning manipulation
tasks that are guaranteed to work despite part imperfection
and manipulator inaccuracy. taking into account these variations
asks for completely different approaches to planning and design,
employing techniques and insights from the confluence of
computational geometry, robotics, and physical modelling.

the phd student will work in the area of algorithmic automation,
and will be supervised by dr. frank van der stappen.


qualifications

* master in computer science or in mathematics with a minor in cs.
* interest (and preferably background) in algorithms design.
* interest in applications in robotics and automation.
* fluency in english writing.


terms of employment

the candidate is offered a full-time position for 4 years.
salary starts with eur 2.042.- per month in the first year and
increases to eur 2.612.- gross per month in the fourth year.
the salary is supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and
an end-of-year bonus of 8,3% per year. in addition we offer:
a pension scheme, a partially paid parental leave, flexible
employment conditions. conditions are based on the collective
labour agreement dutch universities. the research group will

            ***** postdoctoral position available *****

      center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                   orebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for a position as a post-doctoral researcher
in the area of hybrid planning at orebro university,  sweden .  this is
an initial 18 month appointment fully funded within the eu project
gert -- ""generalizing robot manipulation tasks"".  interested
candidates can apply now and until the position is filled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the gert project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and
robust in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project
we address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such
novelty in manipulation tasks.  

the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a robot to autonomously
generalize its manipulation skills from a set of known objects to
previously unmanipulated objects.  to do so, the gert project includes
research activities in the areas of hybrid planning (see below),
perception, learning and grasping.  the platform used within gert is the
dlr robot justin, a very advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.

the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute (germany), the
university of birmingham (uk), and orebro university ( sweden ).  more
details on can be found on the project web site www.gert-project.eu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the position
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the successful candidate will be employed as a postdoc with orebro
university for an expected duration of 18 months.  the main task of
the postdoc will be to perform world-class research on hybrid planning
in the context of the gert project.  hybrid planning in this context
means that, when planning for a task, the robot needs to reason both
about the purposes of actions on a symbolic level, and about the
kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects it manipulates.  
the research is expected to involve a suitable combination of
theoretical investigation, concrete implementation, and empirical
validation on the justin platform at dlr.

the postdoc will work within the local gert team at orebro university,
which currently includes two faculties, a postdoc and a phd student.
she or he will also collaborate with the other european partners in
the gert project, both remotely and through physical meetings and
research visits.  a small amount of teaching may also be part of the
postdoc's duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
prerequisites and application process
----------------------------------------------------------------------

in addition to a clear interest in the research topic, the successful
applicant must have a strong theoretical background in computer science,
and solid programming skills.  a phd in computer science, computer
engineering or comparable field is required.  we particularly seek
candidates with experience in artificial intelligence and planning, and
with inclinations towards cross-disciplinary research.  knowledge of the
swedish language is not required, but proficiency in written/spoken
english is mandatory.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <asaffio at aass.oru.se>.  applications can be
sent immediately, and they will be accepted until the position is

research federation tims cnrs 2856
project v2i (innovative vehicles and infrastructures)

objective: to redesign, build and test a prototype of 4wd fast mobile robot with pitch angle stabilization capacities during the aerial phase of motion after taking off on an obstacle.

actors of v2i project:
- jean-christophe fauroux (associate professor, lami): robotics – mechanical design.
- christophe gouinaud (associate professor, limos): embedded computing – robotics.
- philippe vaslin (associate professor, limos): mechanical models - computing.

laboratories:
- lami (ea 3867 – fr tims / cnrs 2856) – ifma.
- limos (umr 61 58 cnrs) – isima.

context: this post-doctoral offer completes an existing phd offer that was funded in 2010. the objectives of the phd are to model, design and build an articulated mobile robot with four independent suspended driving wheels (robcat), capable to move at high speed (10 m/s) on rough terrain and to land on its wheels in case of unexpected take off on a complex obstacle. this vehicle would be capable to mimic the cat twist from information provided by on-board sensors measuring the wheel speeds and the absolute and relative orientations of the front and rear axles.
this work on the aerial phase of motion is the natural extension of the anr fast national project, supposed to end in 2011, and more focused on ground displacements. the fast project allowed to develop a mobile robot equipped with innovative suspensions.

subject: the subject of this post-doctoral work is mainly focused on the aerial stabilization of pitch angle thanks to the mobility of the wheels. starting from the robot prototype developed during the fast project, a new robot named robcat will have to be designed and equipped with various sensors (inertial sensors for body and wheels) connected to an embedded acquisition system and dedicated to measure real values of the kinematic parameters used in the aerial model. the proprioceptive measures will be completed with exteroceptive measures provided by a fast video camera recording all the phases of standardized jumps. the robot will also be equipped with separated controls for front and rear axles (accelerator, brakes), allowing an experimental validation of the influences of the controls on the vehicle behavior during the aerial phase. after several experiments and simulations of the general model, it should be possible to control the front and rear axles depending on the inertial information provided by proprioceptive sensors.

possible extension: to integrate active suspensions in the mechanical model and on the robcat robot in order to study their influence before taking off on the angular momentum of the robot during aerial phases. suspension motions and motors motions could be combined before and during aerial phases.

applications: robcat, fast rolling robot for rough terrains, has many potential applications: agriculture, exploration, safety, demining, emergency aid...

duration: 12 months. starts in 2011 as soon as possible

candidate profile:
– less than 35 year old
– coming from a lab located out of france
– with knowledge in multibody dynamic modeling
– capable to design mechatronics systems and mobile robots (mechanical design, control, electronics, computing)
– with good expertise in the field of experimental robotics, embedded sensors and camera vision.

************************************************************************
subject : modeling and control of reconfigurable parallel robots





context :

because of the heavy economic pressure, most of the companies are  
forced to quickly modify their means of production (manufacturing  
tools, machines, robots
) in order to ensure a high productivity, a  
high flexibility and to increase their production capacity. therefore,  
the principle of reconfigurable manufacturing system answers the needs  
of agility and productivity and permits to substantially extend the  
tool use so as to be suitable for the production of a great range of  
products.



according to this report, new machines, mechanisms and robots appear  
such as new parallel robots which are able to change their  
configuration or operating mode in order to increase their workspace  
and/or modify their kinematic structure. however, even if this kind of  
mechanisms could be used to increase the manufacturing system  
productivity and agility, new phenomena (parallel and serial  
singularities
) are introduced and locally reduce the robot  
controllability which affect the robot workspace and making the robot  
reconfiguration more difficult.



thesis objectives :

the main objective of the thesis is to develop a new control law  
(based on advanced modeling) dedicated to parallel robots  
reconfiguration. the algorithm would permit the parallel and serial  
singularities crossing for both increasing the robot workspace and  
allow the change of robot configuration without using additional  
actuators (no redundancy). therefore, it consists of using an optimal  
and/or variable modeling of the robot coupled with calibration  
algorithm, observers and advanced control laws (multi-model control  
algorithm
) so as to ensure the robot stability close to the robot  
singular position. as a consequence, the main goal is to increase the  
robot workspace and to ensure the robot stability (mechanical and  
automatic stabilities point of view) by managing on-line the robot  
reconfiguration/change of posture in function of the task to be done.



the technical objective consists of carrying out the parallel and  
serial singularities crossing on each actual robots located at ifma  
(french institute of advanced mechanic): the parallel robots 3crs[1]  
and 3rrr[2]. in the case of the 3crs robot, the aim is to reconfigure  
the robot so as to modify its kinematical structure from 3crs to 3prr  
in order to permit the realization of new tasks. in the case of the  
3rrr robot, the goal is to show how the theoretical developments are  
used to improve the robot workspace in order to decrease product cycle  
time.

scientific locks identified give the thesis a multidisciplinary aspect  
which transcend mechanic, automatic, computer science and electronic.

·         which mechanical modeling can be used for singularity crossing ?

·         how the quality of motion transmission close to a  
singularity point can be evaluated, which criterion is adapted ?

·         which control law is adapted to ensure the robot stability ?

·         how many observers have to be used for motion variables estimation?

·         how the trajectory is modified or influenced by the  
singularity crossing ?

·         how the robot reconfiguration is managed according to the task ?



the thesis originality is also characterized by the formulation of a  
new control law algorithm (based on an advanced modeling) experimented  
on actual robots and used to manage on-line the robot reconfiguration  
according to the task so as to increase the manufacturing tool agility.

1013,2011,phd thesis proposal: towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics,"*phd thesis proposal*

towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics

*context*

high precision industries, such as semi-conductor industry, are in need 
of machines combining high accuracy and high throughput. to date this 
need has been covered mostly by standard equipment such as x-y tables; 
however this approach is now reaching its limits in terms of maximum 
speed and acceleration. on the other hand, robots have been designed for 
pick-and-place industries which can reach very impressive accelerations 
but none of them have demonstrated enough accuracy to satisfy the 
semi-conductor industry requirements.

indeed designers are facing two scientific and technological barriers: 
serial machines suffer from high inertias limiting their acceleration 
capability; parallel mechanisms suffer from poor stiffness limiting 
their accuracy.

this thesis aims at advancing those frontiers and will be developed in 
synergy between the etel company (switzerland) and lirmm (france).

*research approach*

at first the research work will be guided by generic needs coming from 
industrial applications. starting from this, innovative concepts of 
kinematics, actuation systems, measurement and control strategies should 
be searched for. modeling of various inaccuracy sources (joints, 
transmissions, vibrations, control, etc) should be carried out so that 
their impact on the global system can be clearly understood. in this 
research work, both mechanical design and control issues should be 
investigated. along the project, assessment of results and proof of 
concepts should be made by designing and operating prototypes.

*environment*

etel is the world's leading supplier for direct drive and motion systems 
with research, development and production facilities in môtiers, 
switzerland; lirmm is a joint laboratory of université montpellier 2 and 
cnrs, and is installed in montpellier, france. research will be mostly 
done in montpellier but frequent visits and stays in môtiers are 
foreseen. ph.d. dissertation shall be written in english to facilitate 
dissemination among etel employees.

academic adviser will be dr. françois pierrot 
(http://www.lirmm.fr/~pierrot/).

1028,2011,"vacancy: full professor in machine learning with special emphasis on its application to autonomous systems interacting with humans, university of amsterdam","apologies for cross-posting

the informatics institute at the university of amsterdam is looking for a

                full professor in machine learning

the position focuses on machine learning, with a special emphasis on its 
application to autonomous systems interacting with humans. using 
distributed sensors, such systems observe their environment, including 
the people contained in it, and generate goal-direct autonomous 
behavior. machine learning is a critical tool, not only for processing 
observations and understanding the environment, but for selecting the 
most effective behaviors.since autonomous systems and the machine 
learning tools that make them possible are of growing importance in many 
branches of computer science, they are strategic priorities at the 
university of amsterdam. examples of applications abound in gaming, 
safety and crisis management, health care, information retrieval, 
transport management, robotics and image processing. over the past

has established an internationally recognized research group in this 
area. combining foundational, experimental and applied work, the group 
is active at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer 
interaction, robotics and computer vision. it aims to develop the 
algorithms necessary for building real-world autonomous systems.
doing so will require new advances in topics such as adaptive sensing, 
supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and multiagent systems.
the new professor will lead this effort as chair of the above-mentioned 
group, one of the eight research groups that comprise the informatics 
institute. the appointee is expected to be a prominent scientist whose 
presence will strengthen the institute.

within the faculty of science, the information sciences are organized in 
two research institutes, the informatics institute and the institute for 
logic, language and computation. the informatics institute encompasses 
around 230 members, organized in an education group, an administrative 
bureau and eight research groups that cooperate intensively, both 
formally and informally.

the faculty of science occupies a leading position internationally in 
its fields of research and participates in a large number of cooperative 
programs with universities, research institutes and businesses. the 
faculty has a student body of around 3,000 and 1,500 members of staff, 
spread over eight research institutes and a number of faculty-wide 
support services. a considerable part of the research is made possible 
by external funding from dutch and international organizations and the 
private sector. the faculty of science offers thirteen bachelor's degree 
programmes and eighteen master’s degree programs in the fields of the 
exact sciences, computer science and information studies, and life and 
earth sciences.

since september 2010, the whole faculty has been housed in a brand new 
building at the science park in amsterdam. the installment of the 
faculty has made the science park one of the largest centers of academic 
research in the netherlands.

we offer a challenging job at a dynamic and ambitious university, a 
permanent tenured appointment as full-time professor with a competitive 
salary and an attractive package of fringe benefits, for instance: 
generous leave arrangements, application for attractive fiscal 
arrangements are possible for employees from abroad, attractive 
retirement benefits, collective health insurance and excellent parental 
leave packages

full information including a more elaborate profile description is 
available at http://www.uva.nl/vacancies. the closing date for 
applications is 1 august 2011. for further information, questions and/or 
comments you may contact the chair of the selection committee, prof. dr.

the department of advanced robotics

(http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics) at the italian institute of technology, iit (an english language institute) placed in genoa has 2 phd positions within the hyq project. starting date is in january 2012.



we are seeking two highly motivated phd students to work on the topics detailed below. the students will be working in the framework of the hyq project. this hydraulic quadruped hyq is a unique research platform. it is a fully torque controlled electric/hydraulic quadruped robot equipped with inertial measurement units, laser range finders and stereo cameras.

-power transmission systems for autonomous robots

tutors: david branson, dr emanuele guglielmino, dr claudio semini and industry supervisor

n. of available positions: 1

the ability of a robot to operate autonomously in any environment is dependent upon its capacity to provide the necessary power. the design and testing of effective portable power supplies has therefore become increasingly important. current robot designs show significant limitations in the duration, output, noise, weight, and environmental friendliness. what is needed is a powertrain system that addresses the need for adequate power output while maintaining a low weight and compact profile.

a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot (called hyq) platform has been developed at iit and provides the ideal working platform for the development and testing of such devices. the robot is able to perform highly dynamic tasks such as jumping, running and rough-terrain walking (http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hydraulically-actuated-quadruped-hyq.html). the aim of the project is to develop a compact and light weight power transmission system for the hyq robot to enhance power-autonomy. this will include investigating the energy storage medium (e.g. hydrogen gas, gasoline, h202, propane, etc.), electrical and hydraulic power supply systems and components. the project will also look at optimizing power transmission efficiency, reducing noise output, and the need to consider environmental and health implications.

work will involve design, modeling, simulation, prototyping and experimental work on a team based project at iit and with industrial partners. the candidate should ideally have a top class master's degree in mechanical engineering or mechatronics or similar. experience with power transmission systems would be a benefit but is not essential. the candidates must also have good writing and communication skills (60% mechanical design, 20% hydraulics, 20% software).

for further details concerning the research project, please contact: david.branson at iit.it<mailto:david.branson at iit.it> or emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it<mailto:emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it> or claudio.semini at iit.it<mailto:claudio.semini at iit.it>





-water hydraulic technology for robotics

tutors: dr emanuele guglielmino, dr david branson

number of available positions: 1

there is an increasing trend in hydraulic power transmission to replace petroleum-based fluids with water in an effort to reduce dependence on petroleum products. water is more environmentally friendly, easier to dispose of. however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, its lubrication is poorer, and internal leakage of the components is higher. hence research into appropriate component selection and system design is necessary to ensure proper application.

this project will look at the introduction of a water based fluid medium to achieve tasks such as walking, trotting, jumping, and rough-terrain walking on the hyq quadruped hydraulically-actuated robotic platform developed at iit. the project will be initially based on a system approach using off-the-shelf components to eliminate the need for component design at the initial stage.

the outcome of the project will be first a working leg using servovalve and digital hydraulic technology, and in the long term a full version of hyq using water hydraulics. in particular research to improve powertrain efficiency through the use of digital hydraulics will be carried out. the project will involve some control, simulation work and mechanical system design to integrate hydraulic components into the robotic structure.

the candidate should ideally have a top class master's degree (or similar) in mechanical engineering, mechatronics or a related domain. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills. ideal candidates should have experience in fluid dynamics, and have programming skills in c. experience with proe, and/or amesim would be a benefit but is not essential.

general information
-----------------------------------------------
a phd studentship is available in swarm robotics at the iridia-code, the artificial intelligence lab of the  université libre de bruxelles, belgium. 
swarm robotics is inspired by the observation of social insects (e.g. ants, termites, wasps and bees) which stand as fascinating examples of how collectively intelligent systems can be generated from a large number of simple individuals. as in their natural counterpart, the robots used in swarm robotics are relatively simple, with local and limited sensing and communication abilities. it is a natural consequence of these individual characteristics that the overall systems are robust against failures of individuals and scalable with group size. the student will work within a scenario in which robots are given a task whose solution requires strict cooperation, studying how a swarm robotics system can adapt to different tasks, varying environmental conditions, varying numbers and types of robots, and to different levels of malfunctioning of the robots.

the student we are looking for should possess a degree that allows to embark in a doctoral program (doctoral student positions). the area of  competence should be in at least one of the following disciplines:  computer science, computational intelligence, electrical engineering,  cognitive sciences. a master's degree with research experience is an asset. the student should have a strong background in computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other relevant computational disciplines. in particular, she/he should demonstrate very strong programming skills in one or more major computer languages. good communication and team-working skills are essential.

(http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics) at the italian institute of 
technology iit (an english language institute) placed in genoa has 2 phd 
positions within the hyq project. starting date is in january 2012.

we are seeking two highly motivated phd students to work on aspects of 
control and planning of dynamic locomotion through unstructured terrains 
(e.g. running through a forest, jumping, 'orienteering'). the students

quadruped hyq is a unique research platform. it is a fully torque 
controlled electric/hydraulic quadruped robot equipped with inertial 
measurement units, laser range finders and stereo cameras.

http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hyq.html

legged robots have an advantage over wheeled robots in difficult and 
unstructured environments (e.g. outdoors, accident and disaster sites, 
etc). while this is the motivation behind much of the research in legged 
robotics the actual solutions are still largely confined to rather 
simple 'laboratory conditions'. the reasons for this are many, ranging 
from mechanical and design aspects through software to challenges in 
control and theoretical difficulties. in the department of advanced 
robotics at iit we are working on the technology to change this. we are 
developing legged robots and the required control, planning and 
navigation algorithms to enable fully autonomous, fast and reliable 
operation for in- and outdoor settings.

the exact research program will be determined both based on the 
background and interests of the students and the need of the project. 
possible research topics include but are not limited to: control of 
floating base articulated robots, kino-dynamic planning, probabilistic 
planning & control, force & impedance control, learning and adaptive 
control of legged robots, dynamic terrain and obstacle perception and 
modeling, path planning.

the ideal candidate has an excellent background in robotics, control 
engineering, dynamical systems or similar fields. excellent programming 
skills are a prerequisite. it is furthermore desired that the student 
has a practical flair and a desire to do experimental work. the work 
will require elements of theoretical work, software implementation and

1066,2011,phd position at inria sophia-antipolis : life long navigation and map learning,"title: life long navigation and map learning

subject: the objective of this phd, funded by astrium/eads, is to 
investigate
the general problem of visual mapping of complex 3d environments that evolve
over time. this requires explicitly taking into account the variability of
viewing conditions and content within a 3d geometric and photometric 
model of
the environment. a central objective will be to investigate how to 
efficiently
and accurately represent this model. the aim is to build models that remain
usable over long periods of time for navigation tasks (localisation and path
following) for autonomous systems or for people that require guidance. this
research problem, which is already active in the vision community, has only
just begun to be investigated by the robotics community via the new 
perspective
of incremental slam (simultaneous localization and mapping).

now that the problem of modelling large-scale environments is well 
understood,
the next major technical challenge on the horizon is the problem of 
being able
to maintain a valid environment representation over a long period of 
time. this
problem is referred to as life-long learning. this topic is in 
continuity with
the research carried out conjointly between p.rives from the arobas team at
inria sophia-méditerranée and a.comport from cnrs-i3s unsa

the implementation of the work will be integrated, tested and validated on
robotic platforms available at inria sophia-antipolis and partner 
laboratories.


requirements : for this position, candidates must be enrolled in a masters
stream with a focus on computer vision, visual servoing, and/or automatic
control. the candidate should have also good abilities for software 
development
and report writing.

1085,2011,open phd position: development of a medium sized dynamic quadruped robot (in hyq robot project @ iit),"*open phd position for the development of a medium sized dynamic 
quadruped robot within the hyq project (hydraulic quadruped robot) @ iit*

the department of advanced robotics 
(http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics) at the italian institute of 
technology iit placed in genoa has several open phd positions within the 
hyq project. starting date is in january 2012.

we are seeking one highly motivated phd student to work on the 
development of a medium sized dynamic quadruped robot. the students will 
be working in the framework of the hyq project. the hydraulic quadruped 
hyq is a unique research platform: it is a fully torque-controlled 
electric/hydraulic quadruped robot, ready for versatile locomotion. hyq 
is capable of performing both precise movements and strong and fast 
motions that are necessary for dynamic tasks such as jumping and running.
http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics/hyq.html
the hyq robot is powered by a combination of electric and hydraulic 
actuators. hydraulic cylinders are a crucial element of the robot design 
since they enable high joint speeds and torques and are robust against 
impact loads during running and jumping. hyq's current dimensions are 
comparable to the size of a goat or a small horse.

the goal of this phd proposal is the development and evaluation of a 
smaller sized version of the robot. the design of the new robot platform 
will be based on the experiences gained from hyq and through modelling 
and simulation. the phd student will evaluate different actuator 
technologies and construction materials, design and test prototype legs 
and finally build and experimentally evaluate the full quadruped robot.

requirements: the successful candidate is able to both work in a team 
and independently. he/she has a top degree in mechanical, mechatronic or 
electric engineering, preferably with practical experience in robot 
design. (60% mechanical design, 20% hydraulics, 20% software).

project 1:  bio-inspired perception and guidance for unmanned aircraft systems

the goal of this exciting project is to investigate the challenging problem of vision-based 3d perception and guidance for autonomous aerial robots using a bio-inspired approach. the aim is to develop and demonstrate autonomous technologies that will allow small uas flying at low altitude to negotiate obstacles and to accomplish their missions in highly cluttered and dynamic environments. there are three main areas for study:



1. real-time 3d perception: development of a novel and new framework for robotics-oriented image processing and computer vision using a new generation of bio-inspired vision sensors such as artificial compound eyes and dynamic event-based cameras. the focus will be on the design of unconventional efficient and robust algorithms based on the ecological perception paradigm.



2. guidance system: this is mainly concerned with the development of guidance strategies for obstacle avoidance and path planning. two bio-inspired approaches will be investigated and compared. the first one is the insect-inspired method using optic flow, and the second one is based on the tau-theory which is originated from research on ecological psychology.



3. implementation and flight testing: the phd project will also involve the implementation of the proposed algorithms on aerial vehicles and evaluation of their performance through indoor and outdoor flight experiments.





project 2: aerial terrain relative navigation for pinpoint and safe landing of unmanned aircraft

the aim of the project is to develop and demonstrate a system that will enable unmanned aircraft to perform

non-gps accurate (pinpoint) and safe landing at a designated unprepared site. the proposed research will investigate

two different approaches: 1) adapt and apply the technologies developed by nasa jpl for spacecraft

landing on mars [1][2] for pinpoint landing of unmanned aircraft; and 2) attack the problem from a different

angle altogether, using the way birds and insects navigate to their goal as insight and inspiration. the work

involves:

- landmark extraction and topological-metric map building.

- landmark recognition and visual route/place cognition.

- absolute position estimation.

- visual odometry or path integration between mapped landmarks.

- real-time implementation of the developed algorithms and flight testing of the system using real unmanned aircraft.





in addition to these main research activities, phd students will be also involved in other projects and collaborative activities with other international universities and leading aerospace companies such as boeing and insitu pacific.





qualifications:

applicants should have completed a bachelor degree with first class honours or a master's degree in engineering, mathematics or computer science, and:

1110,2011,two phd positions on hybrid knowledge representation,"two phd positions on hybrid knowledge representation *****

         center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     örebro university,  sweden 
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

applications are invited for two phd student positions in computer
science at örebro university,  sweden .  the positions are in the area of
hybrid knowledge representaiton and reasoning, planning and execution
monitoring in the context of the eu project race.  the positions are
for three years.  application deadline is october 15, 2011.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the positions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

the main task of the students will be to perform world-class research
on hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning, and hybrid planning
and plan execution monitoring, for robotic systems.  hybrid in this
context means that the robot is capable of inferring new information
about its environment from a variety of information of different
nature.  for instance, the robot will consider flexible temporal
requirements (e.g., serving food while it is warm, but not too soon
after the previous course) together with causal requirements (e.g.,
serving a meal satisfies the goal of feeding the guests) and resource
constraints (e.g., dishes from the previous course must be cleared as
space must be made for the new course).  such requirements should be
upheld both during planning and on-line execution monitoring.

the successful candidates will be employed as phd students with örebro
university for an expected duration of three years.  they will work
within the local race team at örebro university, but they will also
collaborate with the other european partners in race, both remotely and
through physical meetings and research visits.  a limited amount of
teaching may also be part of the phd student's duties.

more information can be found at http://aass.oru.se/crs/positions.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the race project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

race, ""robustness by autonomous competence enhancement"", is a european
union fp7 project.  the overall aim of race is to develop an artificial
cognitive system, embodied by a service robot, able to build a
high-level understanding of the world it inhabits by storing and
exploiting appropriate memories of its experiences.  experiences will
be recorded internally at multiple levels: high-level descriptions in
terms of goals, tasks and behaviours, and sensory and actuator skills
at the lowest level.  race will develop methods for conceptualizing
acquired experiences so as to extend the robot's planning and execution
capabilities beyond preconceived situations.

aass's role in race concerns (1) the development of knowledge
representation and reasoning schemes suited for reasoning about
multiple types of experiences; and (2) the use of this acquired and
inferred knowledge for plan generation and execution.  constraint-based
techniques will be explored for both representation and reasoning and
planning/execution monitoring purposes, and in particular a meta-csp
approach for integrating temporal, resource, causal and spatial
reasoning will be examined.

the race consortium consists of six european partners: the university
of hamburg (germany), the university of leeds (uk), örebro university
( sweden ), the university of osnabrück (germany), the university of
aveiro (  portugal  ), and the technology transfer institution hitec
e.v. (germany).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
about the working place
----------------------------------------------------------------------

örebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university which currently
enrolls more than 15,000 students.  it is located in örebro, a city of
130,000 inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass) is one of the
strong research environments at örebro university.  it carries out
multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, computer
science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  the research
and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic.  researchers
come from a dozen different countries, in europe and worldwide, and
have different scientific and cultural backgrounds.  aass also
frequently hosts international researchers and is involved in several
international projects.

movement on grasping success, we will develop a bayesian method to
track the state of the object in real-time during grasping attempts.
important model parameters (such as body dimensions and effective
friction coefficients) will be simultaneously estimated.  the method
will combine predictions made by a model of multibody dynamics of the
hand/object system and corrections deduced from observation data from
visual, tactile, and proprioceptive sensors.

qualifications:
applicants for this position should have a bachelor’s or master’s
degree in computer science, computer engineering, or closely related
field (for example, control engineering and systems engineering) with
a solid foundation in continuous and discrete mathematics.  very good

gain servo controllers.
although these properties provide highly precise positioning, the 
resulting large mechanical output impedance makes them inherently 
incapable of handling the unpredictable environmental conditions.
this research theme is aimed at remedying these problems by exploiting 
the compliance control in multimodal biped robot locomotion.


theme 2: exoskeleton/power assist robot control

in control systems laboratory of toyota technological institute, we 
built a whole-body power assist robot to provide power augmentation for 
humans.
power augmentation is required in various situations; i) manipulating 
heavy objects (upper body) or ii) providing assistance to legs for 
walking motion (lower body)
the main goal in this research topic is to develop a control methodology 
which handles the aforementioned power augmentation scenes while 
ensuring the safe human-robot co-existence.

the phd students will be supervised by prof. tatsuo narikiyo, prof. 
michihiro kawanishi and dr. barkan ugurlu. monthly scholarships will be 
provided.

1168,2011,phd position in parallel robotics at lirmm/etel,"the lirmm (montpellier laboratory of computer science, microelectronics 
and robotics) in france is seeking (again) a candidate for a phd founded 
by etel motion technology, in switzerland.
only high-standing candidatures will be considered.

phd subject title
-----------------------
towards pick-and-place machines with very high accuracy and dynamics

context
-----------
high precision industries, such as semi-conductor industry, are in need 
of machines combining high accuracy and high throughput. to date this 
need has been covered mostly by standard equipment such as x-y tables; 
however this approach is now reaching its limits in terms of maximum 
speed and acceleration. on the other hand, robots have been designed for 
pick-and-place industries which can reach very impressive accelerations 
but none of them have demonstrated enough accuracy to satisfy the 
semi-conductor industry requirements.
indeed designers are facing two scientific and technological barriers: 
serial machines suffer from high inertias limiting their acceleration 
capability; parallel mechanisms suffer from poor stiffness limiting 
their accuracy.
this thesis aims at advancing those frontiers and will be developed in 
synergy between the etel company (switzerland) and lirmm (france).

research approach
--------------------------
at first the research work will be guided by generic needs coming from 
industrial applications. starting from this, innovative concepts of 
kinematics, actuation systems, measurement and control strategies should 
be searched for. modeling of various inaccuracy sources (joints, 
transmissions, vibrations, control, etc) should be carried out so that 
their impact on the global system can be clearly understood. in this 
research work, both mechanical design and control issues should be 
investigated. along the project, assessment of results and proof of 
concepts should be made by designing and operating prototypes.

environment
------------------
etel is the world’s leading supplier for direct drive and motion systems 
with research, development and production facilities in môtiers, 
switzerland; lirmm is a joint laboratory of université montpellier 2 and

description
-----------

the project focuses on field robotics: the use of sturdy robots in unstructured environments. one important example of such a scenario is in search and rescue (sar) operations to seek out victims of catastrophic events in urban environments. while advances in this domain have the potential to save human lives, many challenging problems still hinder the deployment of sar robots in real situations. this project tackles one such crucial issue: effective real time mapping. to address this problem, it adopts a multidisciplinary approach by drawing on both robotics and human computer interaction (hci) techniques and methodologies. 

the project will revolve around the development of simple and effective techniques for control of raposa, a tracked robotic sar platform, as it explores unmapped, unstructured environments. raposa features stereo cameras and primary displays for the robot will be based on integrating these feeds into a head mounted display (hmd). maps will be generated on the fly via development of simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) algorithms and this content will be integrated into the hmd displays using 2d and 3d overlays and augmented reality techniques. to ensure a seamless experience, tracking technologies will be used to monitor and respond to head movements; different mappings for this process will be explored. interaction with content displayed on the hmd using multi-modal techniques such as gestures and voice, and for tasks such as annotation and disambiguation, will also be explored. requirements capture and system evaluation will be conducted in collaboration with fire fighting organizations in lisbon,   portugal  .

(project webpage: http://aurero.isr.ist.utl.pt )

a. job description: this position is based in lisbon. it involves developing and implement an interactive vision-based slam-6d algorithm, first in simulation, and then on the raposa platform. this algorithm will fuse sensory data not only from a stereo camera pair, but also from inertial data and odometry. a depth camera will also be used for an accurate 3d reconstruction of the environment. other tasks will include software integration of interaction elements (e.g. visualizations or control schemes) with the raposa platform, and participation in system evaluations. requirements include a master degree, a strong background on robotics, and preferably experience with probabilistic methods in robotics.

b. main research field: electrical and computing engineering / robotics

c. admission requirements: a masters degree in electrical and computing engineering, computer science, or a closely related field.

d. workplan: research and development of a interactive 6d-slam algorithm, fusing sensory information from several sources (vision, inertial, odometry, and depth camera). integration of the software architecture in the raposa platform. participation in the field experiments at a civil protection team training site.

e. legislation and regulations: law nº. 40/2004, from the 18th of august (research grant holder statute); fct regulations for advanced training and qualification of human resources 2011.

f. workplace: the work will be conducted at the institute for systems and robotics (isr/ist) under the scientific supervision of prof. rodrigo ventura with the support of prof. ian oakley (m-iti).

g. grant duration: the grant will have a duration of 12 months, extended up to 27 months, with estimated start in january 2012.
