(3) micro-fluidic devices for cell manipulation; 
(4) mems-based stem cells characterization. 

in (1) and (2), a microrobotic system based on high precision manipulators
is to be developed to manipulate/characterize biological
cells/beads/organisms with high-throughput for large-scale screening
scenarios. a successful candidate should have hands-on experience or strong
background in motion control and computer vision. 

in (3) and (4), biomems devices are to be designed and microfabricated with
the aim to manipulate/characterize biological cells. a successful candidate
should have hands-on experience or strong background in mechanical design,
integrated circuit design, or mems device design and fabrication. excellent
knowledge in sensing/actuating theories, design and simulation software (e.
g. solidworks, ansys) is a plus. 



requirement on qualifications
all candidates with high motivation, enthusiasm, and independent thinking
are welcome to apply. preference is given to students with a strong research
track record from any one of the fields: mechanical engineering, electrical
engineering, computer sciences, automation and control, mechatronics
engineering, or related disciplines.

idsia is small but visible, competitive, and influential. for example, 
its ant colony optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records 
and are now widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc. (today 
entire conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the 
origin of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial 
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers. idsia's 
artificial recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous 
unlearnable sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, 
artificial evolution and other methods. research topics also include 
complexity and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and 
information theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia was the 
smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the 1997 ""x-lab 
survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth place in the 
category ""computer science - biologically inspired"". idsia's most 
important work was done after 1997 though.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of special 
relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated with 105 
nobel laureates, and boasts the world's highest number of nobel prizes 
per capita, the highest number of publications per capita, the highest 
number of patents per capita, the highest citation impact factor, the 
most cited single-author paper, etc.  switzerland also got the highest

title: microsystems design for microrobotics

a post doc position is available for design, development and 
characterization of actuated bi-stable mechanical microsystems in order 
to build a new kind of microrobots.
microrobotics deals with the design, the fabrication and the control of 
robots able to manipulate small size components (smaller than 1 
millimeter).
the laboratory started studying and designing a new generation of 
microfabricated microrobots using a modular concept and an open loop 
control strategy. these new microrobots, named “digital microrobots” (or 
“/dimibots/”) are based on the assembly in a finally monolithic system 
of several “elementary modules” from a library of basic function 
modules. the first designed structures have demonstrated the relevance 
of this approach, but new developments and improvements are required.

the objectives of the post doc position are:
- to propose new actuated bi-stable mechanical structures 
microfabricated with clean room technologies;
- to contribute to the design and microfabrication of these structures 
and monolithic microrobots;
- to contribute to the static and dynamic characterization of the 
microrobots.

the post doc will take charge of the microfabrication in clean room and 
will use the microfabrication facilities available in femto-st.
the candidate must be ph.d graduated and have an experience in clean 
room microfabrication. a good knowledge in the design of mechanical 
structures and in microsystems is required.

interested candidates should submit a curriculum vitae, evidence of the 
required expertise (papers which could be either published, accepted for 
publication or in preparation), a summary of the research background and 
interests by e-mail to philippe.lutz at femto-st.fr

then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and  
uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to  
complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to  
perform future tasks more efficiently.""

in the cognitive systems we conceive of, a wide and heterogeneous set  
of learning problems can be identified. these scenarios typically  
involve social contexts with a rich multimodal communication between  
human and robot. across these potential learning problems, the  
appropriate representations, learning models and evaluation criteria  
differ widely.

to create a unified theory that makes it possible for the robot to  
reason about its knowledge and lack thereof, and to communicate the  
essence of this reasoning, will most likely require insights from  
fields such as socially guided machine learning, traditional and novel  
forms of machine learning such as active learning, meta learning,  
human-robot interaction, and situated dialogue processing,

we are looking for an experienced researcher with a phd in computer  
science (or equivalent) to work on ""interactive continuous learning of  
crossmodal concepts"" in the cogx project. we need a person with

* a strong background in machine learning,
* preferably with experience in active learning, socially guided  
learning, interactive learning;
* preferably with experience in robotics, artificial intelligence,  
computational linguistics.
* strong analytical skills,
* strong mathematical skills,
* strong programming skills (e.g. c++, java, python),
* experience in collaborative software development (our project  
software is usually developed across 6-7 international sites, with up  
to 15 developers)
* a good command of english, spoken and written

the person will work in an international team. responsibilities will  
include leading the machine learning efforts in our group within the  
cogx project, theory development, implementation and evaluation of  
software in an integrated (robot) system. the person will be expected  
to write, or contribute to writing, scientific papers and articles set  
in the project context.

highly valued personal qualities include creativity, open-mindedness,  
team spirit, and a willingness to address novel challenges in unknown  
scientific territory.

the applicant should have a completed phd degree on commencing the job.

the earliest starting date of the position is september 2008. the  
duration of the contract will probably be until the end of the project  
(june 2012).

this project is entitled ""rossi; emergence of communication in robots 
through sensorimotor and social interaction"", and focuses on the 
development of communication between robots and humans 
(http://www.rossiproject.eu).
in particular, the project is addressing the question of how critical it 
is for communicating agents to share the same general view of the world. 
  agents possessing different sensory and motor systems may have 
different views of the world and therefore may have difficulties in 
communicating. we are exploring to what extent and which aspects of 
world models must be shared in order to facilitate communication between 
robots and humans.  we wish to increase understanding of the 
requirements of affordance based world models, shared models and 
communication provided by such models, based on understanding of 
objects, actions, and processes in their environment. the focus of this 
project is the construction of robots that are able to process simple 
commands and to respond appropriately by interacting with different 
kinds of objects and entities in their environment. this project has 6 
partners in italy, germany,  sweden  and turkey, involving psychologists, 
neuroscientists, computer scientists and robotics engineers. we are 
involved in all stages but especially the implementation of the models 
in a robotic manipulation system and the testing and experimentation 
with real application tasks.

we wish to appoint a post-doctoral research associate who will take 
major responsibility for the programme of research in the context of our 
robotics team.  this post is available on a three-year fixed-term 
contract. we expect to appoint for a start date of 1 march 2008.

- applicants should have a doctorate in computer science, artificial 
intelligence, engineering, or a related scientific field, and be able to 
demonstrate research experience.
- the post requires excellent software skills for the implementation and 
running of a range of experimental components.
- the successful applicant will also be involved in writing scientific 
documents and papers and will be expected to travel and give 
presentations as necessary.

http://robotics.usc.edu/resl
<gaurav at usc.edu>

applications are invited for two postdoctoral positions in marine robotics
at the robotic embedded systems lab (resl) at the university of southern
california. the successful candidates will work as part of a research team
composed of roboticists, marine biologists and oceanographers in the area
of networked multi-robot coordination and control for aquatic robots
(autonomous underwater vehicles (auvs) and autonomous surface vehicles
(asvs)). the development of algorithms for networked aquatic robots with
applications to environmental monitoring, marine biology and oceanography
are central to the research mission of resl as part of its broader
research agenda in the area of networked robots and robotic sensor
networks.

applicants to both positions are required to hold (or shortly receive) a
phd in a related area (e.g., computer science, computer engineering,
electrical engineering, robotics). prior field experience with auvs and/or
asvs is highly desirable.

while the two positions are closely related, the initial plan is that one
will be filled by a candidate specializing in the sensing and control
aspects of a single vehicle and the other will be filled by a candidate
specializing in the coordination across multiple robots; however this
distinction is not rigid and is likely to evolve.

both positions are initially for a one-year term with a possible extension
to two years. applications will be considered on an ongoing basis until
both positions are filled. early applications are encouraged - both
positions are now open.

to apply, please email prof. gaurav sukhatme (gaurav at usc.edu) a current cv
(pdf or plain text only please) and the names and email addresses of 2
people who can provide professional references. all questions regarding
these positions should be directed to gaurav at usc.edu.

the german research center for artificial intelligence (dfki gmbh) is

  researcher

in the area of cognitive systems, for a research position (post-doc,  
or senior) in the eu fp7 ip ""cognitive systems that self-understand  
and self-extend"" (cogx).

the cogx project is a european project in the area of cognitive  
systems and will run from may 2008 till the end of june 2012, [ http://cogx.eu 
  ]. the project (which is a follow-up to the cosy project, [http://www.cognitivesystems.org 
] and [ http://cosy.dfki.de/ ] ) will have a strong emphasis on the  
theoretical and practical integration of capabilities in vision,  
manipulation, mobility, spatial cognition, planning, and dialogue  
processing. cogx will be focused on the dynamics of a system capable  
of actively extending itself to fulfill identified requirements:

""imagine a cognitive system that models not only the environment, but  
its own understanding of the environment and how this  understanding  
changes under action. it identifies gaps in its own understanding and  
then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and  
uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to  
complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to  
perform future tasks more efficiently.""

in the cognitive systems we conceive of, a wide and heterogeneous set  
of learning problems can be identified. these scenarios typically  
involve social contexts with a rich multimodal communication between  
human and robot. across these potential learning problems, the  
appropriate representations, learning models and evaluation criteria  
differ widely.

to create a unified theory that makes it possible for the robot to  
reason about its knowledge and lack thereof, and to communicate the  
essence of this reasoning, will most likely require insights from  
fields such as socially guided machine learning, traditional and novel  
forms of machine learning such as active learning, meta learning,  
human-robot interaction, and situated dialogue processing,

we are looking for an experienced researcher with a phd in computer

human-robot interaction: learning and adaptation for robotic companions as 
assistive technology

university of hertfordshire, hatfield, united kingdom, science and 
technology research institute

applications are invited for a 3-year studenship in the area of 
human-robot interaction in order to study learning and adaptation for 
robotic companions as assistive technology.

contact for informal inquiries: prof. kerstin dautenhahn (e-mail:  k. 
dautenhahn at herts.ac.uk)

description of project:

human-robot interaction is a quickly growing research area with a number 
of applications in assistive technology. the research team at university 
of hertfordshire led by prof. dautenhahn is involved in two european 
projects relevant to this studentship, namely iromec (where robots serve a 
assistive 'toys' for children with special needs, http://www.iromec.org/) 
and lirec (where we  study robots as long-term companions e.g. in the 
homes of elderly people http://www.lirec.org/).

a key research issue relevant to both projects concerns the adaptation of 
the robot.s behaviour. a personalized robot companion needs to know its 
users, and be able to adapt in long-term interaction.  the phd project 
will focus of the topic of social learning and adaptation, i.e. will 
develop the robot.s ability to be taught by its user, and to learn 
socially by observing and analyzing the interaction. such research is 
strongly inspired by biology and psychology concerning the way how humans 
and other animals learn from each other by observation, interaction and 
communication. another area of inspiration comes from developmental 
psychology since infants learn many new skills in interaction with their 
caretakers. the group has a strong track record in the area of imitation, 
social learning and human-robot interaction. the phd student will develop 
new social learning and adaptation algorithms, as well as participate in 
the preparation, implementation and analysis of human-robot interaction 
studies. the phd student would be part of a larger interdisciplinary 
research team consisting of researchers working in the above mentioned 
european projects, as well as other research group members.

requirements:

applicants are required to have a strong first degree or master.s degree 
in computer science, robotics or a related area relevant to the project. 
an additional background in human-computer interaction, cognitive science 
or psychology is highly desirable. excellent programming skills are an 
essential requirement, as well as general interest in interdisciplinary 
research and willingness to collaborate with researchers from other 
disciplines. the ideal candidate will be self-motivated with excellent 
writing and communication skills. the phd project will be supervised by 
prof. kerstin dautenhahn (k.dautenhahn at herts.ac.uk), whom interested 
candidates are invited to contact via email in the first instance.

successful candidates may be eligible for a research studentship award 
from the university (equivalent to 12940 gbp per annum bursary plus the 
payment of the standard uk student fees).

the studentship offers the opportunity to work within the adaptive systems 
research group (http://adapsys.feis.herts.ac.uk/), a proactive, dynamic 
and interdisciplinary research team with an excellent international 
research profile and state-of-the-art facilities to conduct research into

294,2008,post-doc offer at inria tao in learning algorithms for collective robotic experiments,"tao team is hiring a *post-doc* and/or a *phd student* to work in learning
algorithms for collective robotic experiments.

*context*
the symbrion project <http://www.symbrion.eu/> is a european *integrated
project* that aims to build self-addembling robotic organisms from
autonomous individual small robots.
within symbrion, the tao team will investigate learning mechanisms in a
multi-scale perspective, distinguishing adaptive learning (life-time
learning, or on-line learning) and optimization (at an evolutionary
time-scale).

*tasks*
the task will be to design and implement machine learning algorithms under
limited resources on the hybrid paltform (software and hardware) provided by
the project partners. the stress will be put on dealing with huge robotic
logs and learning to construct efficient controller modules.
a first task will consist in applying some learning and/or data mining
techniques to multiple robot logs, while the robots are driven either by a
human being or by a manually written controller. this should allow to
automatically generate controller modules — off-line.
a second task will then be to design a high-level controller to perform the
action selection among different modules, either hard-coded or automatically
designed by the off-line procedure. this controller will be optimized either
off-line using evolutionary computation, or on-line using some algorithms
inspired from the multi-armed bandit techniques.

the ultimate goal of the project is to design on-line protocols to allow
open-ended evolution at both scales of high-level controller and generation
of new low-level modules.

*expertise*
knowledge in machine learning and statistics is of course mandatory, as well
as excellent programming skills (c++ and java). previous experience in
robotics and/or evolutionary computation is welcome.

*practical information*
the tao team is part of inria cri orsay île-de-france and its offices are in
lri <http://www.lri.fr/> at université pari-s-sud. french public salaries
are what they are, but include medical coverage.

303,2008,job opening: socially guided / active learning for interactive cognitive robots,"apologies for multiple copies


===================

job opening (extended deadline -- applications by august 31 2008)

the german research center for artificial intelligence (dfki gmbh) is  
seeking for its language technology lab a

                                                                                   senior 
  researcher

in the area of cognitive systems, for a research position (post-doc,  
or senior) in the eu fp7 ip ""cognitive systems that self-understand  
and self-extend"" (cogx).

the cogx project is a european project in the area of cognitive  
systems and will run from may 2008 till the end of june 2012 [ http://cogx.eu 
  ]. the project (which is a follow-up to the cosy project, [http://www.cognitivesystems.org 
] and [ http://cosy.dfki.de/ ] ) will have a strong emphasis on the  
theoretical and practical integration of capabilities in vision,  
manipulation, mobility, spatial cognition, planning, and dialogue  
processing. cogx will be focused on the dynamics of a system capable  
of actively extending itself to fulfill identified requirements:

""imagine a cognitive system that models not only the environment, but  
its own understanding of the environment and how this  understanding  
changes under action. it identifies gaps in its own understanding and  
then plans how to fill those gaps so as to deal with novelty and  
uncertainty in task execution, gather information necessary to  
complete its tasks, and to extend its abilities and knowledge so as to  
perform future tasks more efficiently.""

in the cognitive systems we conceive of, a wide and heterogeneous set  
of learning problems can be identified. these scenarios typically  
involve social contexts with a rich multimodal communication between  
human and robot. across these potential learning problems, the  
appropriate representations, learning models and evaluation criteria  
differ widely.

to create a unified theory that makes it possible for the robot to  
reason about its knowledge and lack thereof, and to communicate the  
essence of this reasoning, will most likely require insights from  
fields such as socially guided machine learning, traditional and novel  
forms of machine learning such as active learning, meta learning,  
human-robot interaction, and situated dialogue processing,

we are looking for an experienced researcher with a phd in computer  
science (or equivalent) to work on ""interactive continuous learning of  
crossmodal concepts"" in the cogx project. we need a person with

* a strong background in machine learning,
* preferably with experience in active learning, socially guided  
learning, interactive learning;
* preferably with experience in robotics, artificial intelligence,  
computational linguistics.
* strong analytical skills,
* strong mathematical skills,
* strong programming skills (e.g. c++, java, python),
* experience in collaborative software development (our project  
software is usually developed across 6-7 international sites, with up  
to 15 developers)
* a good command of english, spoken and written

the person will work in an international team. responsibilities will  
include leading the machine learning efforts in our group within the  
cogx project, theory development, implementation and evaluation of  
software in an integrated (robot) system. the person will be expected  
to write, or contribute to writing, scientific papers and articles set  
in the project context.

highly valued personal qualities include creativity, open-mindedness,  
team spirit, and a willingness to address novel challenges in unknown  
scientific territory.

the applicant should have a completed phd degree on commencing the job.

the earliest starting date of the position is september 2008. the  
duration of the contract will probably be until the end of the project  
(june 2012).

dfki gmbh [ http://www.dfki.de ] is located on the campus of saarland  
university in saarbrucken, germany. the university's research groups  
and curricula in the fields of computational linguistics and computer  
science are internationally renowned. the lt-lab [ http://www.dfki.de/lt/ 
  ] offers excellent working conditions in a well-established research

306,2008,phd position - high-speed vision-based control - deadline 14/07/08,"phd position:

dynamic control of parallel kinematic manipulators using high-speed vision


1 context and motivation

this position is open within the robotics and autonomous complex systems 
group (rosace), interested in the control of robotic systems. this group 
is part of the ""laboratoire des sciences et matériaux pour 
l’electronique et d’automatique"" (lasmea) in clermont-ferrand, france. 
the scholarship is funded through the french research agency's (anr) 
”young researcher” project virago dealing with the vision-based control 
(or visual servoing) of parallel kinematic manipulators.

parallel kinematic manipulators, as opposed to serial kinematic 
manipulators, are composed of a mobile platform linked to its base by 
several kinematic chains. they thus allow for greater speed 
manipulation, higher loads and higher repeatability than serial 
kinematic manipulators. however, their control is made harder since one 
has to take into account the closure of the various kinematic chains. a 
way to by-pass much of the associated control difficulties is to perform 
eye-to-hand based visual servoing since it alleviates the problem of 
solving the theoretically hard forward kinematic problem. nevertheless, 
classic visual servoing is essentially a kinematic control scheme that 
assumes sufficiently low speeds to neglect the dynamic eﬀects due to 
inertia or coriolis forces. this is not realistic in the case of 
parallel kinematic manipulators designed for high-speed.

therefore, we have been developing a formal framework for high-speed 
vision-based computed torque control, where vision copes with the high 
control frequencies and the control laws with the rigid body dynamics. 
the approach has been validated on the orthoglide prototype in nantes and
accelerations of 1g were reached. the phd candidate will have to extend 
this framework to take into account ﬂexibilities that can not be avoided 
at really high speed. in particular, the experimental validation will 
take place on the new adept quattro robot which reaches 20g accelerations.

2 prerequisites

• good mathematical background
• good mechanical engineering background (multi-body dynamics, robot
control)
• basic knowledge in computer vision
• programing skills
• preferably ﬂuent french but ﬂuent english can be accepted

318,2008,new chair in eindhoven on mechatronics and robotics,"new position full professor in precision mechatronics & robotics at the
tu eindhoven

established at the foundation of the university in 1956, the department
of mechanical engineering of the eindhoven university of technology
(tu/e) is now a premier research department and currently has
approximately 1000 engineering (bsc and msc) students and 100   phd
students. the department participates in the dutch 3tu centre of
excellence on intelligent mechatronic systems. within this centre a new
position has been established for a full professor in precision
mechatronics & robotics.

the region that surrounds eindhoven is characterised by a concentration
of high-tech industry. a focal point of the chair will therefore be on
new generations of high-tech systems. a profound knowledge and an
advanced use of precision mechatronics form a crucial part of the
further development of such systems. a major part of the research within
the new chair will therefore be on the design of precision mechatronic
systems with extreme performance requirements, using innovative
actuating, sensing and control principles, in order to achieve high
speed and high accuracy (up to the nanometer range). indeed,
requirements on precision, accuracy, stability, reliability and speed
are ever more challenging issues in the design and realisation of such
systems. a closely related research field is robotics, with a particular
focus on what is currently referred to as cybernics, as it is believed
that this kind of automation will form the cornerstone of the next
generation of robotics. an additional focus of the chair on the design
of robots in connection to its human-dominated environment will
therefore be welcome. candidates for the chair in precision mechatronics
and robotics should have an excellent research profile in at least one
of the fields described above. 

together with colleagues in control systems technology (steinbuch),
dynamics and control (nijmeijer), and systems engineering (rooda) the
newly appointed professor will be responsible for courses and student
projects in mechatronics, robotics, control, systems, and design, with
emphasis on micro-systems. courses for phd students will be given within
the framework of the graduate school dutch institute for systems and
control (disc).

requirements applicants should: 

* have a phd in engineering sciences, in applied physics or applied
mathematics, and several years of experience thereafter;

* be an authority in the development and application of modern methods
in mechatronics, in particular in fields like precision mechatronics,
and/or robotics, as evident from papers in reputed scientific journals,
invited lectures, membership of editorial boards, scientific committees,
filed patents, etc;

* have a proven record in the acquisition and the management of research
grants at a national and an international level;

* have ample experience in teaching courses at different levels and
proven didactic skills.

phd position on robots in the metaverse


project description
======================================
the metaverse (global standards among real and virtual worlds) project will
provide a standardized global framework that enables the interoperability
between virtual worlds (as for example second life, world of warcraft, imvu,
google earth and many others) and the real world (robots, sensors,
actuators, vision and rendering, social and welfare systems, banking,
insurance, travel, real estate and many others). the project is a funded
through the european itea organization and the dutch senternovem
organization. 

the metaverse project will start with a state-of-the-art review of existing
technology. the first step to classify robots is to create a taxonomy and
nomenclature that may be inspired by the linnaean classification system. the
robot taxonomy will define the criteria on which the classes and orders may
be distinguished. some first works on robot taxonomies are available (fong,
nourbakhsh, & dautenhahn, 2003; yanco & drury, 2004) and will be examined
for applicability. the robot taxonomy will then be applied to robots,
starting with currently available robots and then extending to historical
important robots. their data will be gathered in a web-based database, the
internet robot database (irdb). the irdb will be setup as a community
process that will enable the interested audience to continuously expand and
improve the database. based on the irdb and the taxonomy, a communication
standard and protocol will be developed in close collaboration with the
other metaverse partners, including philips research, vrije universiteit
amsterdam and utrecht university. last, several usage scenarios for the
communication standard and protocol will be developed and tested.

the department of industrial design
======================================
the department of industrial design (id) of the eindhoven university of
technology (tu/e), is a rapidly growing department. the department consists
of 500 students at the bachelor, master and phd level in addition to around
100 faculty members. id focuses on intelligent products, services and
networks. these innovative products enable people to interact with the
environment in an optimal and flexible way. this project will be embedded
into the designed intelligent group (di), which is a multidisciplinary and
highly international group addressing the design of the intelligence in
adaptive systems, products and related services. the cooperating disciplines
include computer science, electrical engineering, neural computing, software
engineering, psychology and industrial design.

research topics proposed
theme 5.1: humanoid robot tactile sensing system
tutor: prof. giorgio metta – prof. valle
n. available positions: 1

tactile sensing is the process of detecting and measuring a given property
of a contact event in a predetermined area and subsequent pre-processing of
the signals – before sending them to higher levels for perceptual
interpretation.  generally, tactile sensing is associated with the force
measurement, but - in view of the above definition - the tactile sensing in
robots should also include detection and measurement of object information
that cannot be deciphered from the force measurement only e.g. temperature. 
the ph.d. research activity will involve the development of tactile sensing
modules and hence of the skin parts for humanoid robots, their integration
with robot and subsequent use in the robot control loop for exploration and
manipulation tasks. the research activity will focus on a limited set of
candidate transduction technologies for contact sensing; piezoelectric
polymers, resistive, capacitive - being the most promising candidates for
measuring geometric and mechanical quantities. the possibility of having
transducers and conditioning electronics on same medium/substrate – with
transducer directly coupled with an electronic device (i.e. fet/tft device)
– will be explored. while the transducers can be placed either on flexible
(e.g. organic) or rigid (e.g. crystalline silicon) substrate – based on
their location on the robot’s body; the conditioning electronics will be
implemented on the silicon substrate.  besides improving the performance of
the sensing system, the approach is expected to provide a solution to wiring
complexity – a key problem in robotics. such a marriage of transducers (e.g.
smart materials like piezoelectric polymers) with fet or tft devices on
rigid (e.g. silicon), or flexible (e.g. organic or elastomeric) substrates,
would also improve the reliability. sensors readout and smart processing
tasks will be implemented with dedicated electronics embedded in the tactile
sensing array. the networking of the modules of tactile sensing arrays, so
obtained, is expected to result in a scalable system.
applicants should have a background in one or more of the following fields:
electronic engineering, microelectronics, computer science, sensors and
robotics. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills and
motivation to work in a highly competitive and multidisciplinary
environment.

giorgio.metta at iit.it


theme 5.2: neuromorphic sensors for humanoid robots
tutor: dr. chiara bartolozzi
n. of available positions: 1

biological sensory systems vastly outperform conventional digital systems in
almost all aspects of perception tasks, where the system must process noisy
and ambiguous stimuli to produce appropriate behavioral responses. digital
systems require vast amounts of resources to extract relevant information
from sensors, but still fail to produce appropriate responses for
interacting with the real world in real time. part of the reason for this
might be the fundamental differences in handling sensory data in biological
systems and machines. “frame-based” time sampling and quantization artifacts
present in conventional sensors are particularly problematic for robust and
reliable performance. on the contrary biological sensory systems make use of
continuous time, stimulus-driven, asynchronous, distributed, collective, and
adaptive principles, that make their interpretation of the external world
reliable and robust. the goal of this project is to introduce in the field
of robotic vision the principles of biological sensory systems design.
specifically we aim at combining the design of novel data-driven
biologically inspired sensory devices with the development of new
asynchronous event-driven computational paradigms, with structure and
morphology that are matched to the requirements of the robots body and its
application domain. the candidate shall work on testing of existing
asynchronous vision sensors and on the design of new sensors with
non-uniform morphology, using analog real-time low-power vlsi neuromorphic
circuits. the candidate will participate in the whole project development by
also tackling the problem of the realization of supporting data driven
asynchronous computational paradigms for machine-vision methodologies that
are radically different from conventional ones, and test the developed
vision system performance on advanced humanoid robotic platforms.
requirements:
applicants should have a strong interest in bio-inspired hardware
engineering and the ability to work independently. good skills in
programming c and matlab. fundamental notions of microelectronics;
background in neuroscience.

theme 5.3: the role of actions for perception: improving perception
abilities of the humanoid icub
tutor: prof. giorgio metta – dr. lorenzo natale
n. available positions: 2

in modern robotic systems perception is too often inadequate and simplified.
this seriously affects the ability of robots to cope with unpredictability
and successfully interact in the real world. artificial perception is a
complex task, in which, despite great efforts in computer science, robotics
and artificial intelligence, only partial successes have been achieved.
the study of perception in humans shows that the brain takes advantage of
the integration of the wealth of information available from the different
sensory modalities, including information about the incipient action
generation. populations of multimodal neurons are responsible on one side
for controlling eye/head, arm, and grasping movements and, on the other, to
interpret actions performed by others, for the recognition of objects, and
to support goal-directed attention processes. the representation of the
world in the brain happens through the activation of multiple pathways and
involves the use of sound, vision, touch, and proprioception mixed with
activations describing the current motor context and the intended goal. this
requires a new way of looking at the problem of learning to extract relevant
information at each stage of processing. outstanding questions regards: how
do we represent the space around us? what visual features are important?
what is the relationship between sound, vision and touch? how motor
information structures the recognition process? of particular interest is
the determination of the link between object-related information and the use
of this information for the control of manipulation.
in this project we are interested in studying methods for improving the
perceptual abilities of the humanoid robot icub (http://www.robotcub.org),
with the goal of exploring ways of using and integrating sensory information
originating from the interaction between the robot and the environment. this
project requires the investigation and implementation on the robot of
several different elements ranging from sensory perception, to motor
control, and machine learning: for example, the realization of explorative
behaviors to extract information about the environment and objects. this
might include grasping and manipulation, but also simpler strategies like
pushing, prodding and squeezing objects. one of the goals here is to build a
representation of objects that goes beyond the level of the single sensory
modality (e.g. vision) but merges the visual appearance of an object with
the haptic sensation it produces when grasped, or the sound it produces when
touched. to reach this level of competency the robot would require the
control of attention and self-recognition.
we seek candidates with a strong background in computer science and
engineering, who are also interested in the study of perception and modeling
of biological systems. knowledge of electronics and mechanics is not
required but it might be useful considered that the successful applicant
will be working directly on a real humanoid robot.

project themes are grouped into four main streams: humanoid robotics, biomimetics, telepresence vr and haptics and medical robotics (see abstracts below) 
 
the deadline for the applications is the 3rd of october 2008.
 
more information and details on how to apply can be found in http://www.iit.it/phd_positions <https://netexchange.netscalibur.it/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?url=http://www.iit.it/phd_positions>

phd themes
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
stream 1: telepresence, vr and haptics

researchers working in this area will work on the development of multimodal telepresence and haptic interaction paradigms, and hardware/software drawing on simultaneously displayed cutaneous and kineathesic experiences, the application of these technologies in human computer interactions and human centred robotics and the key psycho-physical testing of the experiences. the work will draw on expertise in engineering (mechanical and electronic) and computer systems. there may also be a small number of opportunities for researchers from a psycho-physics and/or psychology background.

 

 

theme 3.1: bi-manual semi-exoskeleton for enhanced teleoperation and virtual immersion

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis

n. of available positions: 1

 

the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of training or teleoperation procedures as these actions require the user to extensively engage his hand and fingers. in the recent years the rapid improvements in hardware and software to provide effective force/touch feedback has led to the development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various training simulators and teleoperation systems. in most of these instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered use are relatively poor. in addition these systems provide only point contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. to be of any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic interface. 

the development of a multi degree of freedom haptic system (based on exoskeletal systems) with large isotropic working volume, high backdrivability and multimodal feedback capability will be the core of this research.  

applicants ideally should have a background in one or more of the following fields: electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and robotics. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills and motivation to work in a highly competitive and multidisciplinary environment.

experience with cad and a good knowledge of robot kinematics analysis would be a benefit. 

<mailto:nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.2: integration of multimodal virtual reality system

tutor: eng. andrea brogni, dr. nikos tsagarakis

n. of positions: 1

 

virtual reality systems are daily becoming more complex, due to the evolution of different inputs, such as motion capture, 3d sounds, bio-feedback, haptic interfaces and robots. the integration and the mode of interacting in those multi-modal environments is a fundamental area of research for this field. different sensory streams are coming from different devices and making an interactive application implies deal with many different formats. 

the topic of the research will involve be studying the systems available in the department and the definition of a basic standard for the communications. the design and the development of a multimodal platform for the integration will be the second part of the research. the work will be based on previous studies and in collaboration with other researchers.

the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude to mix theory and practice, including programming c++ libraries and interfaces for hardware.

<mailto:andrea.brogni at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.3: interfacing a virtual reality environment with haptic interfaces and/or robots

tutor: eng. andrea brogni, dr. nick tsagarakis

n. of positions: 1

 

the sense of presence involves the human reactions during the virtual experience. how the user reacts, in behaviour, physiologically and physically, are key points for the evaluation of the level of engagement. using haptic interfaces and robots, we will introduce other feedbacks, i.e. touch and weight or the physical presence of avatars, that will effect how the user interacts and explore how the user behaves in this configuration? what is the best paradigm for the interaction? what kind of applications would be optimal for increasing the level of presence?

the topic of the phd will be studying the human approach in an immersive virtual environment, when a user has to deal with haptic feedback and robotics mechanism. in particular, the interaction with robotic avatars, human-like or machine, during specific collaborative tasks or experiences will be explored.

the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude to mix theory and practice, including programming c++ libraries, interfaces for hardware and 3d opengl graphics. experience in virtual reality and presence field could be an advantage.

<mailto:andrea.brogni at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.4: investigation of the physiology and psychophysics of the human fingertip.

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell

n. of positions: 1

 

the human fingers and particularly the fingertips are key to the haptic perception of contact with an environment, yet there is a comparatively poor understanding of the nature of finger tip sensing and perception. 

this work will involve a study of human tactile perception using a tactile array of vertical-moving pins in contact with the fingertip. it will investigate the sensory nature of the finger tip in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and psychophysics methodologies to evaluate human tactile performance and use this data to define and specify the design of haptic interfaces. it is also expected that the work will involve testing an use of fmri and mri scans.

the applicant ideally should have good background in psychophysics. experience in robotics and graphics opengl is an additional bonus but not essential. 

<mailto:darwin.caldwell at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.5: high fidelity telepresence control of a high dexterity robotic hand

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell

n. of positions: 1

 

the teleoperation there is often a poor mapping between the actions of the operator and particularly the hand movements of the operators and the movements of the robotic end-effector. this makes high precision, high fidelity manipulation of small or delicate object exteemely difficult or impossible.

this project will bring together several research threads considering the development of high fidelity input gloves and finger tracking systems, advanced feedback systems for the fingers  (hand exoskeletons, tactile array, thermal feedback) and miniature dextrous manipulators with over 23 dof and advanced tactile sensing.

applicants should have a strong engineering or physical science background.

<mailto:darwin.caldwell at iit.it>  

 


stream 2: humanoid robotics


 

research in this area will focus on all areas of hardware and to a lesser extent software development for humanoid robots. the research will involve the development of novel actuators, high dexterity end-effectors that will link with the haptics/telepresence research, novel tactile sensing, the use of new structures and materials and self healing, and self repair.

 

 

theme 3.6: human friendly actuation technologies

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderbroght

n. of available positions: 1

 

robot actuation has been traditionally based on the use of heavy, stiff position/velocity and torque actuation units coupled with rigid non back-drivable transmission mechanisms. these stiff actuation groups are usually implemented by combining dc-brushed or brushless or ac drives with planetary or harmonic drive gears and/or timing belts with a high gain pd control. these robots are optimised for precision and speed and are highly repeatable, acting within constrained and well defined environments. 

recently, with the introduction of new applications domain such as virtual/tele-presence, robot aided therapy/assistance, humanoids and personal/entertainment robotics and augmentation systems it has become increasingly clear that the traditional actuation approach is not suitable for addressing the performance requirements of these new application domains. the requirement for closer human-robot interaction have highlighted the need for robotic systems which can match the performance of biological systems in terms of ability to regulate displacements and impedance over a wide range of loads and motions enabling control of acceleration and force for enhanced performance, safe interaction and energy efficient task execution. these are key developmental features of all new generation systems. in fact, these requirements are directly linked to the actuation system. the lack of such an actuator unit that can mimic some of the properties of the natural muscle is probably one of the most significant barriers that prevented so far the development of robotic systems exhibiting bio-natural functional behaviour and performance. this limitation of the current actuation technologies is the inspiration for the research which will focus on the:

*     development of new biologically (in terms of functional behaviour) based actuation units to form the motion/force (impedance) sources for the new range of robots. 

*     investigation of appropriate materials and mechanisms (fluidic and nonlinear compliant components, smart materials such electro/magneto-rheological fluids) to be used for the implementation of the variable stiffness, variable damping or full impedance regulation principles.

*     exploration of how these adjustable impedance principles can be embedded into the design of a conventional engineered actuator unit (electric/fluidic drives) from the mechanism point of view. to design and produce this new range of actuator groups in a compact volume without deteriorating beneficial performance attributes found on conventionally mechatronic actuators (i.e. high power to weight/volume ratio, high force to weight/volume ratio, fast response and good position and force control).

*     development of control techniques of the new range of actuation units and demonstrate their application in the development of a lower body for a humanoid robot.

applicants for this area are should ideally possess a strong background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or physical system modelling and control.

theme 3.7: bipedal walking for the humanoid robot ""icub"" 

tutors: dr bram vanderbroght and dr nikos tsagarakis

n. available positions: 1

 

the humanoid robot ""icub"" has been constructed within the european consortium robotcub. the legs have 12dof and are powered by electrical motors. in the first stage of system walking traditional control schemes will be implemented consisting of a trajectory generator and stabilizer. in the second phase stretched knee walking and the use of the toe-joint to make bigger steps will be studied. the last phase of the project consists of changing the hardware of the legs to implement compliant actuation and to adapt the control schemes to make benefit of the compliance regarding improved energy efficiency and adaptability regarding different terrains.

applicants should ideally possess a strong background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science  or physical system modelling and control. 

<mailto:bram.vanderborght at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.8: safe manipulation using compliant actuation

tutor: dr irene sardellitti and dr bram vanderbroght 

n. available positions: 1

 

the next generation of robotic manipulators will operate out of their safety cages and in close proximity with humans. safety hence becomes the primary concern in these devices. passive compliant actuation is the key for safe human-robot interaction, but control schemes controlling both torque and stiffness of every actuator to combine good tracking performances under a desired safety index are still missing. a manipulator actuated with adaptable compliant actuators developed by iit will be built. in the first stage the torque/stiffness needs to be controlled to safely track desired trajectories. in a second phase the manipulator will be controlled without the use of control elements as joysticks, but the user will directly manipulate the load which has to be sensed by the manipulator. preferable a strategy should be developed without using sensory information from torque/force sensors.

applicants should ideally possess a strong background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science  or physical system modelling and control. 

<mailto:irene.sardellitti at iit.it>  

 

 


stream 3: biomimetics


this area will consider the development of hardware, software and sensory systems for biological inspired robotic systems.

 

 

theme 3.9: bio-natural functional locomotion systems and physical principles

tutor: prof darwin g caldwell  

n. of available positions: 1

 

a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot (called hyq) is currently being developed with the aim to study compact hydraulic actuation systems for legged robots and their control incorporating aspects of active/ passive joint stiffness regulation for energy efficient animal locomotion. this will including jumping and running. furthermore the robot will serve as a platform to test compact power systems as an alternative to batteries (petrol/gas combustion engines, fuel cells, etc) to make future robots power-autonomous for several hours. 

the final version of the robot will have the following estimated specifications: weight 70-80 kg (including 10kg payload), height less than 1m, four legs with three degrees of freedom each, hydraulic actuation systems, position and force sensing on joint level, compliance in joints.

the anatomical design of the legs has been inspired by the morphology of biological systems. the specifications for actuator performance result from dynamic simulations. a first prototype leg has been constructed and its performance is currently being tested.

 

positions are open to work on the development of energy efficient animal-leg mechanical systems which emulate the biological systems not only from the morphology point of view but also exhibit bio-natural functional behaviour and performance. this will include the development of actuation techniques allowing this behaviour to be simulated.  the ability to passively regulate the impedance of the actuator will be the key feature of the actuation units.

the first position will consider the locomotion of the robot. after studying different animal gaits such as walk, trot and gallop, dynamic simulations will test stability and efficiency of different control algorithms and motion generators. successful control methods will finally be tested and improved on the robot platform. the second position will focus on the mechanical design of the robot (cad), including the hydraulic actuation system, adjustable stiffness mechanisms and eventually compact power systems. 

 

applicants for this area are should ideally possess a strong background in electronic/electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, or a physical science.

theme 3.10: development of water hydraulic components and systems for robotics

tutors: dr yang yousheng

n. available positions: 1

 

water hydraulics, which uses water instead of oil as the power transmitting medium, is environmentally friendly, non-flammable, inexpensive, clean, readily available, and easily disposable. more importantly, when compared to oil hydraulics, water hydraulics has a quicker response and a higher efficiency. in addition, it is more stable (in terms of flow velocity and efficiency) over a wide range of operating temperatures due to water's higher bulk modulus, a lower viscosity and a higher specific heat capacity. all the above mentioned advantages make water hydraulics appealing in high performance actuation techniques such as robotics.however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, poor lubrication, has higher leakage and requires appropriate material and design. 

the aim of the phd project is to develop water hydraulic components and systems for robotic actuation. the position will focus on the development of compact, small size and light weight water hydraulic components, including modelling, simulation, prototyping, experiment.

the candidate should ideally have a masters degree in mechanical engineering or related areas. the candidates must have good writing and communication skills. ideal candidates should have experience in fluid dynamics, and have programming skills in c or fortran. experience with proe, fluent, adams or amesim would be a benefit but are not essential.

<mailto:yousheng.yang at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.11: autonomous robotic propulsion 

tutors: dr emanuele guglielmino 

n. available positions: 1

 

the aim of the project is the design of an efficient and compact propulsion system (using conventional thermal engines, fuel cells, stirling engines, electrical motors, hybrid solutions etc) in autonomous robots. the work will focus on the integration of conventional and non-conventional engines and motors into autonomous robots (in particular on a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot, hy-q) using  a systems engineering approach.

the candidate should ideally have a good first degree in mechanical engineering (with major in thermal engines) or an equivalent physical science. 

<mailto:emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it>  

 

 

theme 3.12 actuation and power systems

tutor: prof darwin caldwell

n. available positions: 1

actuation systems, power sources and storage of energy are vital and often overlooked features of robotic and humanoid systems. researchers working in this area will explore novel actuation technology (braided pneumatic muscle actuators, polymeric actuators, shape memory alloys, compliant and hybrid actuation) and the enhancement of current technologies (hydraulics, er fluids, mr fluids, piezoelectric motors).  the actuation systems will be incorporated into a new generation of robots having the structure, characteristics and behaviour of humans, hominoids, and/or animals. 

 

previous experience with these technologies would be an advantage but the programme is open to researchers with a strong background in any physical science or engineering discipline.

stream 4: medical robotics


 

theme 3.13: integrated microfluidic devices for biomanipulations

tutor: dr leonardo mattos

no. of available positions: 1

 

the development of sciences such as genetics, drug discovery and environmental health has been greatly increasing the demand for biomanipulation procedures.  transgenic and gene-target animals, for example, are commonly used as models of a wide range of serious human afflictions, including diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, alzheimer's disease, and cancer.  as a consequence, the demand for efficient and consistent biomanipulations has also increased.  these are very delicate operations, which are traditionally performed on clear petri dishes placed under a powerful microscope and using mechanical micromanipulators.  the equipment employed is bulky and expensive, and the training of operators is often a very long process - up to one year for operations such as embryo microinjections.  in addition, the success rate and consistency of biomanipulation procedures are highly affected by the experience and mood of the operators.  therefore, automation is highly desired in this area.

the development of novel microfluidic systems has a great potential to simplify and miniaturize the biomanipulation equipment, improve task consistency, and create a more suitable system for computer controlled operations.  hence, the topic of research will involve the identification of microfabrication techniques suitable for the construction of microfluidic devices for cell work under (or off) the microscope; the design and construction of devices for the different biomanipulation tasks; and the development of computer interfaces and controllers for the novel devices.  the ideal candidate should have a background on engineering or computer science and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.  experience in robotics, biological systems or real-time systems are additional bonuses.

the advent of high-precision motorized micromanipulators and microscopes incorporating video cameras has enabled the creation of effective teleoperated biomanipulation systems.  the use of such systems has demonstrated increased consistency and efficiency of the operations, and also a significant reduction in the training time of new operators.  however, these teleoperated systems still require direct control by a well-trained operator, so the biomanipulations are still susceptible to operator errors and to the inconsistency of manual operations.  in addition, many biomanipulation tasks are repetitive and time consuming, so the operators spend valuable working hours performing tedious procedures.  consequently, the automation of biomanipulation procedures is highly desired. 

a key element for the development of a successful automated biomanipulation system is a fast and robust vision system.  such system should be able to localize and track the objects involved in the tasks, and to provide such information as feedback to automatic controllers.  therefore, the topic of research will involve the design of accurate, robust, and fast vision algorithms for biomanipulation applications. the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.

theme 3.15: intelligent controllers for biomanipulation automation

tutor: dr leonardo mattos

no. of available positions: 1

 

the automation of biomanipulation procedures is expected to facilitate and speedup biomedical research by improving the consistency and efficiency of the operations, and by reducing contaminations.  furthermore, automation is expected to free laboratory personnel from repetitive and tedious tasks; reduce training costs associated with the operations; and reduce the dependency of biomanipulation facilities on individual operators.  however, the success of an automated system is always linked to an efficient and robust control system, which is not easily implemented for biomanipulation tasks because they are often very complex and delicate.  the development of rule-based automatic controllers requires extensive process analysis and, even then, may be susceptible to exception errors in complex tasks.

the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques may offer an alternative for the development of robust and flexible control systems for biomanipulations.  an interesting approach to this problem would be, for example, the development of an intelligent system that can learn tasks by observing expert operators.  another approach could be the development of simulators from which intelligent controllers can be developed.  therefore, the topic of research will involve the investigation of online or offline learning methods applied to the generation of automatic system controllers.  experimentation will be performed in collaboration with the iit's neuroscience department, and will be based on the available fully teleoperated biomanipulation system.  the ideal candidate should have a background on computer science or engineering and a strong attitude towards mixing theory and practice.  experience in a.i. and robotics are additional bonuses.

humanoid robots, cpg, bio-inspired control, adaptive behaviour

*post-doctoral researcher work description*
the object of this postdoctoral research consists in studying neural 
adaptive controllers based on plastic biological models dedicated to 
locomotion of a 3d simulated biped. the goal is to control dynamical 
behaviours of the biped and to compensate some deficiencies or 
mechanical damage like rupture of transmission in its hip, knee or ankle.
following the currently research activity in the lisv laboratory, the 
study will be focused on the synergy and functioning of the biological 
mechanisms. the neural network plasticity commanding the motor activity 
of the articulated locomotion will be investigated. this will allow us 
testing several corrector models taken from biology for different gaits. 
the method consists on the design of the neural controller following the 
evolutionary robotics approach based on what is currently developed in 
the lisv for hexapod robots.


*research context*
this work falls under the research project phema (humanoïde platform for 
the study of human walk with and without deficiencies). phema project, 3 
years duration, is supported by the national french research agency. 
phema aims a better understanding of the locomotion mechanical synergies 
that govern the human walking, by reproducing it in simulation and with 
a real anthropomorphic robot. several static and dynamic behaviours 
taking into account motor deficiencies which characterize walking 
handicaps will be raised. phema is making roboticians, neurobiologists 
and doctors work jointly. phema project is in connection to the previous 
robian project 
(http://www.lisv.uvsq.fr/accueil/recherches/rh/projets/robian/index.htm) 
for which a biped robot was built.

342,2008,"postdoc position in explorative motor learning at cor-lab, bielefeld university","cor-lab at bielefeld university invites applications from outstanding
postdocs in the area of autonomous explorative motor learning

the successful candidate has a strong background in at least two of the 
areas visual servoing, dynamical systems and control, and machine 
learning. the research project will cover dimension reduction methods,
development of adaptive vision-based controllers, their evaluation in
physics-based simulations and on real robot hands, and the development 
of explorative learning strategies. the candidate should be able to
autonomously acquaint oneself with new research topics, supervise
undergraduate students, and integrate into the existing team.

research topic
humans gradually increase their manual competence by active exploration 
of the manipulation capabilities of their fingers. as compared to 
learning from sensory data, active learning incorporates the exploration 
into the skill acquisition process.
the project targets to research such active learning paradigms, and to
apply them to real-world scenarios such as object-in-hand-manipulation
with dexterous robot hands. one interesting example is to learn to 
rotate a cube so that certain faces become visible one after the other. 
the learning scheme should exploit multimodal perception, such as joint 
angle sensors, tactile sensors in the fingertips, and visual 
information, and integrate these cues with the movement control scheme 
of a dexterous 20 dof shadow robot hand. a major goal of the project 
would be to implement a vertical slice of explorative skills, ranging 
from learning low level finger control (extending eye-hand to eye-finger 
coordination) to realizing desired movement skills of an object held in 
the hand.
generic insights should be gained about how proprioceptive, visual, and 
haptic information has to be combined to drive the exploration process 
and about suitable principles for shaping the exploration. this will 
touch the research areas of reinforcement learning, active learning 
driven by information maximization, or imitation of previously learnt 
episodes.

research environment
the cor-lab has been established at bielefeld university, germany, as a
research centre for intelligent systems and human-machine interaction. 
the cor-lab forms a strategic partnership between bielefeld university 
and the honda research institute europe gmbh, germany. it pursues 
fundamental research in the field of cognitive robots and intelligent 
systems. a particular focus of the cor-lab is the interdisciplinary 
integration of expertise in engineering, computer science, brain 
science, and cognitive sciences, including the humanities and social 
sciences.
the graduate school that is associated with the cor-lab provides an
exciting and stimulating environment for 20 enthusiastic and creative 
phds and postdocs, allowing them to pursue research in international 
teams in close collaboration with an industrial research institute.

the cor-lab offers a three-year scholarship to pursue the research goals
of the project.

title: obstacle avoidance algorithm in dynamic environment

general background
this subject takes place in the context of researches drives on mobile robots
navigation under uncertainty in the frame of tims (technology and information
support systems for mobility and safety) research federation in
clermont-ferrand, france. more particularly, the thesis position will take
place between lasmea (research theme rosace ) and cemagref (research theme most
) and will aim at increasing the autonomy of unmanned vehicle with respect to
uncertainty linked to the robots environment, thanks to the development of
algorithms enabling dynamic obstacles avoidance. numerous works have indeed
been completed in this research context, in particular related to mobile robot
localization and control with uncertain dynamics, but neglecting yet the
interaction with obstacles. the algorithm to be developed will then take
benefit of the algorithms already available and is expected to be based on a
global approach including:

* the mobile robot localization in a known environment. related to the previous
and on going works, several techniques can be used with respect to the vehicle
state. using absolute and known 3d maps, or based on a previous learning and
updating map, these various approached are based on several and various sensors
and often attached to a control approach.
* obstacle detection, description and tracking. this detection has to be focused
on motionless obstacle (building, sidewalk, trees, hole) and dynamic one as well
(such as pedestrian, animals). the detection has then to account for obstacle
motion and dimensions, but also the capability of mobile robots with respect to
its estimated state issued from the monitoring.
* monitoring of the vehicle state and its interaction with environment. the
navigation under uncertain dynamics (in particular in an off-road context)
requires the estimation and reconstruction of both the interaction behaviour
between vehicle and its environment (such as adherence, perturbations,
stability) but also the internal robot operation (such as fault detection).
* reference path and corridor generation based on known map. the motion control
of mobile robots requires in an assumed to be known environment requires the
knowledge of a nominal path to be followed including margin (corridor) pending
on environment and robot capability.
* navigation strategy and control of vehicle motion for obstacle avoidance.
several control strategies are available for obstacle avoidance accounting for
the robot motion control, the efficiency of which depends on the environment
context and robot state. the selection of an appropriate strategy with respect
to the estimated robot configuration and respecting the navigation goal (path
tracking, velocity preservation) is a key issue of this subject.

work objectives and methodology
the proposed thesis will contribute to the design of a navigation system
dedicated to mobile robots subject to uncertain dynamics. several strategies
for obstacle avoidance will then be proposed pending on the robot
configuration, state and its interaction with the environment. based on works
related to the localization, motion control and detection already in
development. more particularly, the work will be focused on the modelling of
robot interaction with its environment and potential obstacle allowing to
derive a dynamic obstacle definition. coupled with the motion control, several
techniques (such as path deformation or potential field) will be studied,
improved and evaluated to allow the robot navigation ensuring its integrity.
the interaction with trajectory tracking control laws will also be study to
preserve motion accuracy with respect to a desired path, preliminary defined.

theoretical developments will be tested in full scale experiments thanks to the
experimental platforms available in the research federation. the electrical
autonomous mobile robots aroco (for natural environment) and cycab (dedicated
to urban environment) equipped with numerous exteroceptive and proprioceptive
sensor will be more particularly used to show the capabilities of proposed
algorithm.

361,2008,"postdoc position mbari, california","[apologies for multiple messages]


the autonomous system group at the monterey bay aquarium research  
institute (mbari) invites applications for 1 postdoc position.

mbari (http://www.mbari.org)  is a private non-profit oceanographic  
research institute located in moss landing, california, in the heart  
of the  largest marine sanctuary in the united states, just outside  
silicon valley. the institute is an inter-disciplinary research  
institution guided by a strong peer relationship between scientists,  
engineers and marine operations staff. mbari pioneered the use of  
remotely operated vehicles (rovs http://www.mbari.org/dmo/vessels_vehicles/tiburon/tiburon.html) 
  and autonomous underwater vehicles (auvs http://www.mbari.org/auv/default.htm) 
  for deep ocean research and continues to be at the cutting edge of  
marine robotics, marine sensor development, ocean chemistry, marine  
geology, micro-biology and ecology.

research focus:

the autonomous systems group is uniquely placed as being the only  
artificial intelligence group within an operational oceanographic  
setting anywhere. the focus of the groups effort is in automated  
reasoning for embodied robust intelligence for auvs with a focus on  
automated planning, execution, constraint-based reasoning and machine  
learning. the core development effort is to enable adaptive control  
for auvs to survey, sample and characterize dynamic and episodic ocean  
phenomenon such as harmful algal blooms, fronts and thin layers which  
have substantial societal impact (http://www.mbari.org/autonomy/ 
trex/). further efforts are underway to study the feasibility of goal- 
based commanding for underwater feature-based slam, mixed-initiative  
platform control and multi-vehicle coordination.

research environment:

the autonomous systems group was established in 2005 by researchers  
from nasa with extensive background in commanding spacecraft including  
the twin mars rovers spirit and opportunity. a strong inter- 
disciplinary effort with biological oceanographers at mbari and others  
outside has driven the design and deployment of a hybrid executive*  
which enables an auv to adaptively sample the environment using  
planning and machine learning techniques to inform dynamic in-situ  
behavior. publishing in peer-reviewed conferences and journals in ai,  
robotics and the ocean sciences and interacting with scientists in the  
fields of biology, chemistry, ecology, genetics, ocean physics, marine  
robotics is an important aspect of the research effort. the group  
collaborates with ai and robotics researchers in academia in the us  
and europe and hosts visiting graduate students and researchers from  
within the us and europe.

key topic areas of interest for this position are:

1. automated planning and execution
2. scheduling
3. machine learning
4. constraint-based reasoning
5. distributed planning

applicants are encouraged to communicate with the pi for project  
feasibility and relevance to ongoing mbari research. women and  
minorities are strongly encouraged to apply. details of the

364,2008,postdoctoral research position at the massachusetts institute of technology,"postdoctoral research position at the massachusetts institute of technology

a postdoctoral research position is available immediately in the department of
mechanical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit),
cambridge, usa.  the appointment duration is 12 months, with a possible
extension.

the research will focus on the design of novel mechanisms/robotic systems that
utilize the interplay of compliant mechanisms and active fluids and materials. 
the synergy of these technologies will yield highly deformable and flexible
mechanisms and robots that are capable of changing shape to adapt to their
environment, e.g. to negotiate passages that are significantly smaller than
their nominal dimensions.  the robot's mobility will be derived from principles
of adhesive locomotion, which will allow it to negotiate vertical and inverted
surfaces.  the stiffness of the robot structure will be modulated by various
types of active fluids.  the research program is (i) part of a collaboration
between multiple investigators at mit and boston dynamics
(http://www.bostondynamics.com/), and (ii) is sponsored by the defense advanced
research programs agency (darpa) under the ?chemical robots? program.  see

http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/materials/multfunmat/chembots/index.htm

we seek applicants with demonstrated excellence in the synthesis, modeling,
design and fabrication of compliant mechanisms and/or robotic systems. 
preference will be given to applicants that are (i) experienced with
conventional and rapid prototyping of mechanisms, and (ii) have designed and
developed a successful compliance-based mechanism or robot.  knowledge of and
experience with compliant or flexure-based mechanism design is highly desired,
however applicants will be judged primarily on their creativity and practical
design and fabrication knowledge.

applicants should submit 1) a cv, 2) 1-3 recent publications in electronic
format, 3) the names and contact information of three individuals who can serve
as professional references, and 4) a design portfolio, consisting of videos,
images, and/or text describing a significant design accomplishment(s).  the
total file size of applications should be less than 10 mb.  only electronic
applications will be considered.

title: obstacle avoidance algorithm in dynamic environment

general background
this subject takes place in the context of researches drives on mobile robots
navigation under uncertainty in the frame of tims (technology and information
support systems for mobility and safety) research federation in
clermont-ferrand, france. more particularly, the thesis position will take
place between lasmea (research theme rosace ) and cemagref (research theme most
) and will aim at increasing the autonomy of unmanned vehicle with respect to
uncertainty linked to the robots environment, thanks to the development of
algorithms enabling dynamic obstacles avoidance. numerous works have indeed
been completed in this research context, in particular related to mobile robot
localization and control with uncertain dynamics, but neglecting yet the
interaction with obstacles. the algorithm to be developed will then take
benefit of the algorithms already available and is expected to be based on a
global approach including:

* the mobile robot localization in a known environment. related to the previous
and on going works, several techniques can be used with respect to the vehicle
state. using absolute and known 3d maps, or based on a previous learning and
updating map, these various approached are based on several and various sensors
and often attached to a control approach.
* obstacle detection, description and tracking. this detection has to be focused
on motionless obstacle (building, sidewalk, trees, hole) and dynamic one as well
(such as pedestrian, animals). the detection has then to account for obstacle
motion and dimensions, but also the capability of mobile robots with respect to
its estimated state issued from the monitoring.
* monitoring of the vehicle state and its interaction with environment. the
navigation under uncertain dynamics (in particular in an off-road context)
requires the estimation and reconstruction of both the interaction behaviour
between vehicle and its environment (such as adherence, perturbations,
stability) but also the internal robot operation (such as fault detection).
* reference path and corridor generation based on known map. the motion control
of mobile robots requires in an assumed to be known environment requires the
knowledge of a nominal path to be followed including margin (corridor) pending
on environment and robot capability.
* navigation strategy and control of vehicle motion for obstacle avoidance.
several control strategies are available for obstacle avoidance accounting for
the robot motion control, the efficiency of which depends on the environment
context and robot state. the selection of an appropriate strategy with respect
to the estimated robot configuration and respecting the navigation goal (path
tracking, velocity preservation) is a key issue of this subject.

work objectives and methodology
the proposed thesis will contribute to the design of a navigation system
dedicated to mobile robots subject to uncertain dynamics. several strategies
for obstacle avoidance will then be proposed pending on the robot
configuration, state and its interaction with the environment. based on works
related to the localization, motion control and detection already in
development. more particularly, the work will be focused on the modelling of
robot interaction with its environment and potential obstacle allowing to
derive a dynamic obstacle definition. coupled with the motion control, several
techniques (such as path deformation or potential field) will be studied,
improved and evaluated to allow the robot navigation ensuring its integrity.
the interaction with trajectory tracking control laws will also be study to
preserve motion accuracy with respect to a desired path, preliminary defined.

theoretical developments will be tested in full scale experiments thanks to the
experimental platforms available in the research federation. the electrical
autonomous mobile robots aroco (for natural environment) and cycab (dedicated
to urban environment) equipped with numerous exteroceptive and proprioceptive
sensor will be more particularly used to show the capabilities of proposed
algorithm.

384,2008,"postdoc position mbari, california","[apologies for multiple messages]


the autonomous system group at the monterey bay aquarium research  
institute (mbari) invites applications for 1 postdoc position.

mbari (http://www.mbari.org)  is a private non-profit oceanographic  
research institute located in moss landing, california, in the heart  
of the  largest marine sanctuary in the united states, just outside  
silicon valley. the institute is an inter-disciplinary research  
institution guided by a strong peer relationship between scientists,  
engineers and marine operations staff. mbari pioneered the use of  
remotely operated vehicles (rovs http://www.mbari.org/dmo/vessels_vehicles/tiburon/tiburon.html) 
  and autonomous underwater vehicles (auvs http://www.mbari.org/auv/default.htm) 
  for deep ocean research and continues to be at the cutting edge of  
marine robotics, marine sensor development, ocean chemistry, marine  
geology, micro-biology and ecology.

research focus:

the autonomous systems group is uniquely placed as being the only  
artificial intelligence group within an operational oceanographic  
setting anywhere. the focus of the groups effort is in automated  
reasoning for embodied robust intelligence for auvs with a focus on  
automated planning, execution, constraint-based reasoning and machine  
learning. the core development effort is to enable adaptive control  
for auvs to survey, sample and characterize dynamic and episodic ocean  
phenomenon such as harmful algal blooms, fronts and thin layers which  
have substantial societal impact (http://www.mbari.org/autonomy/ 
trex/). further efforts are underway to study the feasibility of goal- 
based commanding for underwater feature-based slam, mixed-initiative  
platform control and multi-vehicle coordination.

from nasa with extensive background in commanding spacecraft including  
the twin mars rovers spirit and opportunity. a strong inter- 
disciplinary effort with biological oceanographers at mbari and others  
outside has driven the design and deployment of a hybrid executive*  
which enables an auv to adaptively sample the environment using  
planning and machine learning techniques to inform dynamic in-situ  
behavior. publishing in peer-reviewed conferences and journals in ai,  
robotics and the ocean sciences and interacting with scientists in the  
fields of biology, chemistry, ecology, genetics, ocean physics, marine  
robotics is an important aspect of the research effort. the group  
collaborates with ai and robotics researchers in academia in the us  
and europe and hosts visiting graduate students and researchers from  
within the us and europe.

key topic areas of interest for this position are:

1. automated planning and execution
2. scheduling
3. machine learning
4. constraint-based reasoning
5. distributed planning

applicants are encouraged to communicate with the pi for project  
feasibility and relevance to ongoing mbari research. women and  
minorities are strongly encouraged to apply. details of the

404,2008,postdoc position in planning under uncertainty,"a postdoctoral research grant is available at the institute for
systems and robotics (isr) of the instituto superior técnico, lisbon.
the topic of the grant is

planning under uncertainty for multiagent/multi-robot systems.

due to restrictions in communication, centralized planning solutions
are not always viable.  decentralized partially observable markov
decision processes (dec-pomdps) form a formal approach for multiagent
planning.  they handle uncertainty in acting and sensing in a
principled way, and recent years have seen great progress in planning
algorithms for dec-pomdps.  in this grant, we intend to advance the
state of the art in planning algorithms and their scalability.
furthermore, we will consider a case study concerning the
decentralized control of irrigation channels, in which we will apply
planning under uncertainty techniques to design an autonomous
controller for each gate in a channel.  more details can be found at
http://decpucs.isr.ist.utl.pt/ .

isr-lisbon is a research institute of the instituto superior técnico,
the oldest and largest engineering school in   portugal  .  isr-lisbon has
a long standing tradition of research and development and offers a
modern and enthusiastic research environment with strong
interdisciplinary and international links.

the grant has duration of (a maximum of) two years, and candidates
should have obtained a relevant phd degree (e.g., computer science,
artificial intelligence, electrical engineering).  the ideal candidate
has expertise in markov decision processes and decentralized control.
applications should include cv, a statement of research interests and
two recommendation letters, and be sent to dr. matthijs spaan at
