idsia was the smallest of the world's top ten ai labs listed in the  
1997 ""x-lab survey"" by business week magazine, and ranked in fourth  
place in the category ""computer science - biologically inspired"".  
idsia's most important work was done after 1997 though. it is small  
but visible, competitive, and influential. its highly cited ant colony  
optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark records and are now  
widely used in industry for routing, logistics etc (today entire  
conferences specialize on artificial ants). idsia is also the origin  
of the first mathematical theory of optimal universal artificial  
intelligence and self-referential universal problem solvers (previous  
work on general ai was dominated by heuristics). idsia's artificial  
recurrent neural networks learn to solve numerous previous unlearnable  
sequence processing tasks through gradient descent, artificial  
evolution and other methods. research topics also include complexity  
and generalization issues, unsupervised learning and information  
theory, forecasting, learning robots. idsia's results were reviewed  
not only in science journals such as nature, science, scientific  
american, but also in numerous popular press articles in time, the ny  
times, der spiegel, etc. many tv shows on tech & science helped to  
popularize idsia's achievements.

switzerland is a good place for scientists. it is the origin of  
special relativity (1905) and the world wide web (1990), is associated  
with 105 nobel laureates, and boasts far more nobel prizes per capita  
than any other nation. it also has the world's highest number of  
publications per capita, the highest number of patents per capita, the  
highest citation impact factor, the most cited single-author paper,  
etc, etc. switzerland also got the highest ranking in the list of  
happiest countries."

the fact that the human brain works so efficiently is owed to its self- 
organizing capacity, its deeply hierarchical approach, its adoption of  
unsupervised and supervised learning strategies, its capacity to adapt  
almost instantly to new circumstances, etc. why not try to build an  
automatic speech recognizer and handwriting recognition engine that  
incorporates the same principles? this is exactly what we will do in  
two recently approved projects:

* “self-organized recurrent neural learning for language  
processing” (organic), funded by the european commission within the  
7th framework program. details about the project can be found at the  
preliminary reservoir computing website (http://reservoir- 
computing.org).
* “reservoir computing for auditory pattern recognition” (recap),  
funded by the research program of the research foundation - flanders  
(fwo).

the research concerns the investigation of architectures and  
algorithms for the efficient learning of large recurrent neural  
networks based on the reservoir computing concept (where only a linear  
readout layer is learned in a supervised way whereas the recurrent  
connections are fixed or trained in an unsupervised way). important  
research topics are the unsupervised learning of a large hierarchy of  
recurrent sub-layers, and the integration of various adaptation  
techniques. the application domains are off-line handwriting  
recognition, speech recognition and various aspects of robotics (such  
as robot localization, motion control, ...). so far we were able to  
demonstrate that reservoirs can give rise to the robust recognition of  
digits spoken or written in isolation, but now we want to demonstrate  
that they can also yield robust recognition of continuous speech and  
handwriting (large vocabulary).

requirements
candidates should have a masters degree in electrical, computer or  
physics engineering; or in physics, mathematics or computer science. a  
good knowledge of english is essential. no professional background is  
required, but the ideal candidates have some acquaintance with machine  
learning, programming (python, matlab, ...), statistics, signal  
processing, speech recognition, control engineering, or robotics.

what we offer
we offer an opportunity to perform at least three years of research in  
a new promising domain, and to get a doctoral degree in this domain.  
there will be ample opportunities for establishing international  
contacts (stays at partner universities, participation to  
international conferences). as an employee of the university you will  
receive a competitive salary (starting with a net monthly salary of  
approximately 1.600€) as well as excellent secondary benefits (holiday  
allowance, etc.). belgium was ranked first on the “best countries for  
academic research” worldwide list (the scientist, 2007), and ghent  
university was appointed second place on the “best places to work in  
academia” non-us list (the scientist, 2006).

application and timing
if you are interested in one of the ph.d. vacancies, please send in  
electronic format to benjamin schrauwen (benjamin “dot” schrauwen “at”

a postdoc position is available for a project that is developing

since robotics has grown up out of a hobbyist mindset, insufficient

difficult and uncertain operating conditions in the field.   there 
are three parallel approaches currently being taken in this project, 
although other approaches may be considered in the future. the first 
approach analyzes field failure data and maintenance record data and 
also uses simulation models to identify and predict the most 
important components from a reliability perspective.  the second 
approach looks at how robots can be re-designed and/or how 
manufacturing techniques and acceptance sampling tests can be adapted 
in order to improve reliability.  the third approach accepts that 
failures will occur, and develops on-line control approaches that can 
help a robot reconfigure itself (or its control architecture) to 
continue operating in a degraded mode to complete the desired mission.

437,2009,two postdoc positions (2 years) laas and verimag : toward a validated and verifiable architecture for autonomous robots,"two post-doctoral positions at laas-cnrs and verimag,
  toulouse/grenoble,
    france

title: toward a validated and verifiable architecture for autonomous  
robots

subject:

in recent years, laas and verimag have joined their know-how and  
efforts to develop a new architecture methodology which embed some  
formal verification techniques and enable the synthesis of robot  
controller which are correct by construction. this new methodology  
relies on two paradigms. on one side, the verimag bip component based  
design approach which allows the deployment of embedded real-time  
systems and one the other side the laas architecture and its  
development tools : in particular genom, which lays down an open  
framework where one can harness the bip approach.

bip is a software framework for modeling heterogeneous real-time  
components. the bip component model is the superposition of three  
layers: the lower layer describes the behavior of a component as a set  
of transitions (i.e. a finite state automaton extended with data); the  
intermediate layer includes connectors describing the interactions  
between transitions of the layer underneath; the upper layer consists  
of a set of priority rules used to describe scheduling policies for  
interactions. such a layering offers a clear separation between  
component behavior and structure of a system (interactions and  
priorities). from a bip model, one can synthesize a controller which  
is ""correct by construction"", and associated with the bip engine, will  
only fire and run the valid interaction in the system. the obtained  
bip model can also be used off-line to check general safety properties  
by computing behaviors and interactions invariants.

the laas/genom methodology is based on the encapsulation of each basic  
functionality of the robot in a module. all these modules are built by  
instantiating a unique generic canvas. each module is specified by  
providing the following information: the internal functional data  
structure (ifds), the list of services (started with requests)  
provided by this module, the list of posters (if any) exported by this  
module and the list of execution tasks with their respective  
activation period.

as a first step, we have already combined the two approaches and are  
now able to synthesize a complete bip controller of the functional  
level of an exploration rover (dala, an irobot atrv) [bensalem et al.  
09].

our goals are now to:
- improve the current genom/bip integration in the following directions:
 + development of a real-time bip engine
 + development of a distributed bip engine
 + development of a high level ""langage"" to specify and check  
properties in the bip model
- develop the use of bip at a higher level in the robot architecture  
(deliberation layer):
 + model of the supervision component
 + model of the planning/plan execution component
 + model of the situations recognition component.
- develop of an abstracted functional representation to integrate  
functional components written with other frameworks

each of these research venues will be both examined and studied at  
verimag from the v&v point of view and at laas from the robotics point  
of view.

hence we are looking for two postdocs (one for each site) for 2 years  
each. the postdoc whose background will be closer to robotics will be  
at laas, and the one whose background is more in the v&v field will be  
at verimag. both postdocs will do cross regular visits at the other  
places and will take part in a number of projects related to this  
research topics.

requirements: phd in a related field (embedded real time system, robot  
control architecture, temporal planning with contraint based approach,  
model based software architecture, formal validation and verification,  
etc).

(http://www.bgu.ac.il <http://www.bgu.ac.il/> ) is seeking a graduate
student. 

 

execution of purposeful arm movements such as pointing, reaching and
grasping involves high computational complexities. this is because more
degrees of freedom (dof) are available in the arm than are actually needed
for reaching a target in space. the current research involves the
development of a novel robotic controller based on paradigms which belong to
the modern science of complexity such as cellular automata, self-organizing
and self-synchronization networks and discrete chaotic dynamics (dcd). we
have developed some results for mathematical modeling of brain neuronal
networks by dcd algorithms which have been demonstrated principle ability
for multi-component system control and navigation. these results could be
used for the developing of controller for robotic arm and hand motion
control.

 

candidates with engineering, computer science or mathematics background are
sought. candidates must have solid knowledge in mathematics and computer
programming. knowledge in control, an robotics is advantageous.

“/dimibots/”) are based on the assembly in a finally monolithic system 
of several “elementary modules” from a library of basic function 
modules. several designed structures (chen qiao and al, ieee/asme mesa 
2008)have demonstrated the relevance of this approach, but new 
developments and improvements are required.

the objectives of the post doc position are:
- to propose new actuated bi-stable mechanical structures 
microfabricated with clean room technologies;
- to contribute to the design and microfabrication of these structures 
and monolithic microrobots (mems);
- to contribute to the static and dynamic characterization of the 
microrobots.

the post doc will take charge of the microfabrication in clean room and 
will use the microfabrication facilities available in femto-st.
the candidate must be ph.d graduated and have an experience in clean 
room microfabrication. a good knowledge in the design of mechanical 
structures and in microsystems is required.

=========================

a postdoctoral position to be held at lirmm lab (montpellier, france)  
is available immediatly in the area of medical robotics. scientific  
description of the research activities are detailed below and  
contacts are given

title

instrument-organ interaction modeling for physiological motion  
compensation using force and us-image measurements.

location

the montpellier laboratory of informatics, robotics, and  
microelectronics (lirmm)

robotics department,

dexter team (medical robotics and parallel mechanisms)

address: laboratoire lirmm, département de robotique

   161 rue ada 34392 - montpellier - france


project description

the position is available within the national framework « uscomp »  
founded by the anr (french research agency) in 2008.

in this research project, we want to provide methods and solutions to  
perform real time motion compensation of organs using ultra-sound  
(us) images.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the us-probe position  
with respect to the physiological motion of the observed patient  
structure. this allows the surgeon to work on stabilized image and to  
perform thus a surgery of quality.

to do so, the us-probe (a 2d or 3d probe) will be held by a vision- 
force controlled surgical robot. to enhance the performance and the  
robustness of the system, we propose to use in the controller loop a  
model of the interaction between the us-probe and the patient skin.  
since this interaction model is patient specific, it must be  
estimated in-line based on the measurements given by the force sensor  
and the us-probe.

the main goals of this work are:

·      to model the interaction between the us-probe and the patient  
soft tissues (superficial and underling layers)
·      to propose a patient specific protocol to estimate in-line the  
parameters of the model
·      to identify the relationship between the applied forces and  
the tissues deformation
·      to use the calculated model to control the contact interaction  
between the us-probe and the patient skin
·      to implement the model in a predictive force controller: this  
allows maintaining the contact between the probe and the patient skin  
and offers to the surgeon stable and good quality us-image despite  
the physiological motion of the organs
·      coupling the force measurement and the us-image information  
within a hybrid vision/force controller. here, the control and the  
coupling strategies are to be defined (hybrid approach, data fusion,  
dynamic projector, …)

requirements

candidates with excellent background in biomechanics and/or living  
tissue modeling and/or medical robotics are encouraged to apply. c++  
programming is also requested. qualifications include ph.d., m.d.- 
ph.d., or equivalent doctoral degree. french language is not required.


starting date / duration / salary


the position will be available at the earliest convenience for a  
maximum 18 months duration. the salary will be around 2200€ per month.

starting date: september 1, 2009 or october 1, 2009

duration: 20 months

monthly salary: 2357 euros (1923 euros free of tax)

context:

this post-doctoral position is part of the research project anr contint 
uscomp funded by the french national research agency (anr).
this project involves a collaboration with the visages project-team in 
rennes, lsiit in strasbourg and lirmm in montpellier.
its goal is to provide methodological solutions allowing real-time 
compensation of the motion of living soft tissues during ultrasound 
imaging.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the displacement of a 2d 
or 3d ultrasound sensor in such a way to stabilize the observed
image thanks to a robotized probe holder.
this project deals with the complete signal process of the system, 
including perception of the environment and robot control.
the problematic concerns more specially the use in the control scheme of 
the per-operative ultrasound image,
the interaction force between the probe and the soft tissues and the 
measurements of external signals providing the breathing state of the 
patient.

mission:

the main goal of this postdoc is to propose new visual servoing 
techniques based on ultrasound images to automatically synchronize
the displacement of a robotized ultrasound probe with the soft tissue 
motion.

activities of the postdoc are:

- to determine the visual features that can be extracted from live 
segmented ultrasound images
and that are pertinent to perform the robotic task of soft tissue motion 
stabilization.

- to model the interaction that links the variation of the retained 
visual features to the probe displacements.

- to design a kinematic control law using the developed interaction 
model in order to move the robot holding the probe
in such a way to automatically follow a soft tissue element of interest.

- to implement the proposed methods and the developments performed by 
the lirmm and lsiit partners related to the control part of the robotic 
system.
these developments respectively concern the force control of the 
robotized probe and the extension of the control with a predictive 
control scheme
using the measurement of physiological signals of the patient for fast 
motion compensation capability.

the developed methods will be tested and validated on an experimental 
setup made up of an ultrasound probe mounted
on a six degrees of freedom “hyppocrate” medical robot. in first 
experiments a six-axis “adept viper” robot will also be used to apply
simulated physiological motion to ultrasound phantom in order to 
simulate soft tissue motion.
if first results are convincing, experiments on human will be performed 
using the “hyppocrate” safe medical robot.

requirements:

- competences in robotics and in computer vision are strongly required.
- competences in visual servoing, control and image processing are 
highly recommended.
- an excellent practice in c++ programming is also required.

applications:

applications must include a letter of candidature, a brief vitae, a 
publication list and a letter of recommendation.
applications have to be sent by e-mail to alexandre.krupa at irisa.fr

abstracts of the research topics proposed 

stream 1: humanoid robotics and cognition

theme 3.1: composite materials design for biocompatible robotic structural
elements.
tutors: dr. davide ricci, dr. alberto barone
this ph.d. thesis proposal originates from the collaboration of the iit
robotic, brain and cognitive sciences department with the iit
nanobiotechnology facility.
an essential task that needs to be addressed in the realization of robotic
prosthetic devices is the coupling of structural elements of artificial
limbs with bone tissue. many pre-clinical and also clinical reports
demonstrate that poor scaffold design and inadequate tissue culture
conditions are currently the major problems in bone tissue engineering that
may prevent its successful applications. to overcome these limitations,
novel structural biomaterials and better bio-reactor processes are needed,
capable of sustaining and guiding bone tissue precursors generation and
differentation. within this project, we will pursue the integration of
bio-hybrid synthetic techniques, nanotechnologies and advanced material
processing technologies to obtain three-dimensional scaffolds able to guide
and control tissue growth, differentiation and proliferation.
requirements: potential candidates should have basic background in one or
more of the following fields: materials science, polymer science,
biomechanics
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
davide.ricci at iit.it alberto.barone at iit.it


theme 3.2: finite element analysis and cad design of robotic components made
from variable stiffness composite materials
tutor: prof. giorgio metta
a traditional robot is made of mechanical parts that are assembled with
screws, bearings, levers, gears and other components to obtain the desired
functionality. an emerging trend in robot design relies instead on deriving
the required functionality directly from the materials properties. two
approaches can be envisaged: either by appropriately combining functional
materials with different properties via methods similar to the ""shape
deposition manufacturing"" (kutkosky et al. 1989) or by locally modifying a
composite material properties changing the density and nature of fillers. to
this end, cad and fe simulations are essential tools to choose the
appropriate materials and shape for the robot components. 
the goal of this project is the design of a robot hand for the icub
(http://www.robotcub.org) that includes variable stiffness mechanics,
sensorization (proprioceptive and tactile), wiring and tendon driven
actuation. appropriate controllers are also required to match and exploit
natural compliance but also to compensate for e.g. backlash. the reference
task will be manipulation.
the ideal candidate would have a background in mechanical engineering or
related disciplines, and in particular, skills in finite element
analysis/modelling, robotics, and more in general in the use of polymers in
mechanical design. on the other hand, iit will provide a fully equipped
machine shop with cnc and rapid prototyping machines both on polymers and
metal. the successful candidate is expected to work in a team and contribute
substantially to the design of a future release of the icub.
requirements: physics, mechanical or material engineering,

theme 3.3: learning body dynamics in humans and robots
tutor: dr. francesco nori
humans exhibit a broad repertoire of motor capabilities far beyond the
capabilities of modern robots. remarkably, there is strong evidence that
these capabilities are strongly linked to human adaptability to novel
dynamical contexts (j.r. lackner and p. dizio, 1994) (r. shadmehr and f.a.
mussa-ivaldi, 1994) (j. konczak et al., 1995). related neurophysiological
experiments suggest that this adaptability can be the result of a modular
organization of the central nervous system which forms forward and inverse
dynamical representations by means of multiple modules. 
the final goal of this research project will be to enhance a “state of the
art” humanoid robot (http://www.icub.org) with a “beyond the state of the
art” adaptive dynamical controller. the project should focus on the robot
ability to develop, learn and adapt a multisensory representation of its own
body dynamics and of the surrounding dynamical environment, possibly
exploiting the generalization potentialities behind a modular
representation. 
requirements: engineering background, confidence with dynamical system
analysis, (optional) machine learning, adaptive control 
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
francesco.nori at iit.it and giorgio.metta at iit.it 


theme 3.4: manipulation and learning in humanoid robots
tutor: dr. lorenzo natale
object manipulation is a key ability for robots. however current robots are
very poor at manipulating objects in dynamical or unmodeled environments.
unfortunately this situation is quite common in practical scenarios and
seriously hampers the possibility to employ robots outside industries or
research laboratories. 
in this project we will study the role of haptic information (touch,
proprioception and force) for manipulation. the goals of the project are
two: i) to implement control strategies for grasping and manipulating
objects and ii) to investigate how to use the sensory information
originating from the manipulation of objects (haptic but also visual or
auditory) for learning about objects and the environment. 
the project will be carried out working on the robot icub. the icub is a 53
degree of freedom humanoid robot equipped with dexterous arms and hands
(respectively 7 and 9 degrees of freedom). we have recently added torque
sensing on the arm and realized tactile sensors to be mounted on the hand
and the arm of the robot. 
we seek candidates with a strong background in computer science and
engineering that are interested in studying perception and learning in
artificial systems. backgrounds of electronics and mechanics are not
required, but the candidates should have a strong motivation to work on
robotic systems.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
lorenzo.natale at iit.it and giorgio.metta at iit.it


theme 3.5: reaching and moving in the peripersonal space for a  humanoid
robots
tutor: prof. giorgio metta, prof. luciano fadiga
tantalizing evidence from neuroscience is showing that the control of
reaching in humans and animals is correlated with the activation of several
neural pathways, where touch, proprioception, and vision are intertwined
with motor information in a multisensory representation of the space around
the body (fogassi, gallese, di pellegrino, fadiga, et al. 1992).
the goal of this phd program is to model these multiple neural pathways in
the form of a working controller for a humanoid robot. the robot in question
is the icub which is equipped with vision, proprioception and soon with a
distributed sensorized skin. we will study how this multisensory
representation can be acquired through learning and development during the
interaction of the robot with the environment. we will formulate models that
are in agreement with neuroscience (rizzolatti, fadiga, fogassi, gallese,
1997).
we are seeking candidates with a strong motivation to implement biologically
sound models in a humanoid robot, with a background in engineering or
related disciplines, programming skills, and some machine learning or
computer vision experience. the successful candidate is expected to work in
a team and integrate with the existing development tools and methods.
requirements: engineering or computer science background, some experience in
one of more of the following disciplines: machine learning, computer vision,
control systems, neuroscience.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it or luciano.fadiga at iit.it
 

theme 3.6: neuromorphic sensors for humanoid robots
tutor: dr. chiara bartolozzi
biological sensory systems outperform conventional digital systems in almost
all aspects of perception tasks, where the system must process noisy and
ambiguous stimuli to produce appropriate behavioral responses. the goal of
this project is to introduce in the field of robotic vision the principles
of biological sensory systems design. specifically we aim at combining the
design of novel data-driven biologically inspired sensory devices with the
development of new asynchronous event-driven computational paradigms, with
structure and morphology that are matched to the requirements of the robots
body and its application domain. the candidate shall work on testing of
existing asynchronous vision sensors and on the design of new sensors, using
analog real-time low-power vlsi neuromorphic circuits. the candidate will
participate in the whole project development by also interacting with
researchers developing supporting data-driven asynchronous computational
paradigms for machine-vision methodologies, and participating to the testing
of the developed vision system performance on advanced humanoid robotic
platforms. 
requirements: applicants should have a strong interest in bio-inspired
hardware engineering, fundamental notions of microelectronics and background
in neuroscience.
for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
chiara.bartolozzi at iit.it


theme 3.7: event-driven vision for robot control
tutor: drs. giorgio metta, chiara bartolozzi, r. benosman
the goal of this project is to develop asynchronous event-driven
computational paradigms for designing visual systems based on data-driven
biologically inspired sensory devices providing spike-based outputs. such
sensors respond with spiking events to relative variations of contrast in
their field of view. this approach reduces redundancies and produces a
sparse image coding. the generated data are spatiotemporal volumes which
size and information depend only on the dynamic content of observed scenes.
the real-time asynchronous output nature of the sensors ensures precise
timing information and low latency, yet requiring a much lower bandwidth
used by frame-based image sensors of equivalent time resolution. the high
temporal precision is crucial for real-time interaction with the environment
and is especially suitable for tasks requiring fast evaluation of dynamic
scenes, involving real time interaction with the environment. at the same
time, the nature of the sensor's output requires a radically new framework
of data-driven asynchronous computational paradigms for vision. the
candidate will work on the development of event-driven algorithms for the
visual system of a humanoid robot, the icub, starting from stereo vision and
binocular vergence control to end up with recognition and control of the
robot’s own hands dynamics, with the final goal of objects dexterous
manipulation.
requirements: ideal candidates have a strong background in robotics or
computer vision; candidates with background in neuroscience are also
welcome. they should have potential for excellent research and the
capability to collaborate within an interdisciplinary research group with
people from all these disciplines. they should be highly motivated to use
robotics for tackling fundamental issues in bio inspired perception.

510,2009,"phd position urgent - multi-view slam for the control of space robots - cnrs-i3s, sophia antipolis, france","the computer vision and robotics group at the cnrs-i3s, 
sophia-antipolis, france is seeking an outstanding phd candidate for a 
cnrs funded scholarship. candidates are asked to apply rapidly as the 
project should begin in october 2009.

the position is under the supervision of dr. andrew comport and 
professor tarek hamel and is associated with a project developing new 
techniques in real-time simultaneous localisation and mapping (slam) 
using multi-view computer vision. this project will focus on applying 
these techniques to space exploration in collaboration with thales 
alenia space. this will involve the study of autonomous navigation of 
space robots in unknown environments and safe landing.

the primary part of this study concerns developing a visual perception 
system that localises the spacecraft with respect to reference bodies 
and performs visual servoing to achieve environment mapping and safe 
landing. the interest here will be to use the theory of multi-view 
differential geometry to perform closed-loop visual servoing control. it 
will be necessary to develop an analytic relationship between the 
movement of the space vehicle and the movement of external bodies such 
as asteroids and planets perceived by the visual sensors. this will also 
include identifying pertinent control parameters that adhere to a 
rigorous set of criterion (robustness, stability, precision, efficiency) 
along with the choice of technical constraints such as the optimal 
placement of the cameras. in particular, it will be of interest to 
develop a global task function which allows the aircraft to behave 
correctly in accordance with the online dynamics (for example, the 
movement of an asteroid), changing illumination conditions (according to 
the luminosity and the visibility), perturbations (such as varying 
temperatures) or large differences in perceived scale of the environment.

the second part will involve developing algorithms for mapping the 
environment both in an off-line learning phase and an online update 
phase. the former case will allow to reduce the computational complexity 
of the online problem by performing the bulk of the computational effort 
off-line. this will involve creation of a navigational framework that 
allows the creation of image-based maps within which a robot is to 
execute a global task. given a set of training measurements, task 
planning consists in constructing optimal representations of these maps 
in such a way that localisation and control of the aircraft may be 
perform precisely whilst remaining invariant to dynamic changes in the 
environment. the online map will be updated and integrated into the 
control objective when new and better quality measurements become 
available such as during a landing phase where higher resolution images 
are available closer to the ground.

the candidates for the phd position are expected to have an engineering 
msc degree (ee, cs or physics/maths). strong programming skills in c, 
c++, matlab or equivalent are required and experience in computer vision 
and robotics is desirable. applicants demonstrating excellence in other 
related areas are encouraged to apply. international applications are 
encouraged and will receive logistic support with visa issues. the 
salary is 1757 euro/month gross and will be indexed with inflation.

in the area of cognitive systems. the research position is for a new  
eu project on human-robot interaction (hri) for urban search & rescue  
(eu fp7 nifti [pending]).

the theme of the position is processing stress-affected task-oriented  
dialogue. the theme is set in human-robot interaction in the urban  
search and rescue domain. typical for this domain is that how human  
communicates with a robot varies with the amount of stress that human  
is working under. the point is to investigate how we can combine  
speech recognition, grammatical processing and user models of stress,  
to (a) model how how and when stress influences speech and the form of  
spoken dialogue, and (b) recognize stress levels in speech.

521,2009,job opening: postdoc developing soft robotic device,"researchers in the wyss institute, harvard's school of engineering and applied sciences, mit, boston university, and the harvard medical school are teaming to develop a 'active, soft orthotic device' to be used in clinical applications for treating gait pathologies in children associated with neuromuscular disorders (such as drop-foot, spasticity, etc.). treatments for these pathologies typically employ a passive mechanical brace. while passive braces provide certain benefits, they can also lead to additional medical problems such as disuse atrophy of the muscles, which may lead to long-term orthotic dependence. by employing an 'active, soft orthotic' we can adaptively modify the orthotic stiffness and provide additional actuated assistance to promote muscle usage and rehabilitation. this project will involve a convergence of computer science and machine learning to control a soft robotic device, and studies of materials and actuation strategies to construct a wearable orthotic device, which conforms to the shape of the wearer while providing useful stimuli. the target for this position is to assist with the electromechanical development of the orthotic sleeve (building from first generation prototypes) and integrating a control system derived from models of gait control in humans.

this is a key component to a multi-disciplinary project and it is expected that the successful applicant will actively fortify work between the participating labs. applicants should hold a phd in electrical or mechanical engineering, or computer science. the position is open immediately (10/1/09) and is guaranteed for a year with a possible second year extension. applicants should send a cover letter briefly describing their background and career plans, a cv, and the names and contact information for at least three references. please clearly indicate which position you are applying for. these documents should be submitted as pdf attachments to eng_postdoc at wyss.harvard.edu. harvard university is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer and applications from women and underrepresented minorities are strongly encouraged.

phd fellowships - application deadline september 25th, 2009 




the advanced robotics department of the italian institute of technology (iit) has new phd positions available within the ""biomedical robotics"" area.  the positions are for a 3-year doctoral program in: (1) biomanipulations; and (2) minimally invasive laser surgeries. short descriptions of the proposed research themes are presented below. 
 
(1) theme 1.7: novel sensors and controllers for biomanipulation automation
tutors: dr. leonardo mattos, dr. darwin caldwell
the progress of sciences such as genetics, drug discovery and associated biomedical areas has greatly increased the demand for consistent and efficient biomanipulation procedures. transgenic and gene-target animals, for example, are commonly used as models of a wide range of serious human afflictions, including diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, alzheimer's disease, and cancer. however, the processes involved in the creation of these animal models suffer from the inconsistencies of direct manual operations. the development of novel microfluidic systems has a great potential to simplify and miniaturize the biomanipulation equipment, improve task consistency, and create a more suitable system for computer controlled operations. hence, this research will focus on the design and construction of new microfluidic devices for biomanipulations under (or off) the microscope; the development of computer interfaces and controllers for the novel devices; and on the development of adaptive and precise controllers able to perform complex operations on delicate biological structures.  this research will be conducted in close collaboration with biologists and neuroscience researchers within the iit's neuroscience department.
requirements: the ideal candidate should have an engineering background and be interested in hardware/software integration for biological applications. experience in robotics, microfluidics and/or biomedical systems are additional bonuses.
 
(2) theme 1.8: novel actuators and controllers for minimally invasive laser surgeries
tutors: dr. leonardo mattos, dr. darwin caldwell
this research will focus on overcoming the most significant limitations of current surgical laser procedures: namely poor laser aiming control, poor system ergonomics and the requirement for extensive training of surgeons. the goal will be to design and develop novel motorized laser micromanipulators and controllers to increased precision and safety of the surgeries. the initial aim will be to improve phonomicrosurgeries, so the work will benefit from current collaborations with ent surgeons at san martino's hospital. nonetheless, other surgical applications are thought. 
requirements: the ideal candidates for this research theme should have an engineering background and strong interest in medical robotics. experience in mechanical design, hardware/software integration, and control systems are all bonuses.
 
for further details concerning the above research projects, please contact: leonardo.demattos at iit.it

532,2009,phd positions in hydraulic actuation for robotics,"italian institute of technology

doctoral school on ""life and humanoid technologies""
 
phd positions - application deadline: september 25th, 2009

phd positions are available in the following themes in the area of hydraulic actuation for robotic 
applications at the department of advanced robotics (http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics.html) of the 
italian institute of technology (iit) located in genoa.


magnetorheological technologies for robotics
 
magnetorheological (mr) fluids are a particular class of hydraulic oils that respond to an applied magnetic
field with a dramatic change in their rheological behaviour. they are used in a variety of applications, most
notoriously as controllable dampers in the suspensions of high performance cars. the main characteristic of
these fluids is their ability to reversibly change from free-flowing, linear viscous liquids, to semi-solids with the
yield strength swiftly and continuously controllable (milliseconds scale dynamics) when exposed to a
magnetic field.
since yield stress (and hence viscosity) of these fluids can be varied reversibly by controlling the field
strength, mr fluids are potentially an excellent means to dynamically interface mechanical and electrical
systems.
in robotics they can be used in three areas:
1. as controllable dampers to attenuate vibration
2. as spool-less valve in magnetorheologically-actuated robotic manipulators
3. to introduce compliance in robotic structures
the aim of the project is to investigate at least one of these aspects. the work will have both a simulation
and an experimental part and may include exchange periods abroad in an eu university.
technical skills : degree in mechanical/electrical/mechatronic engineering (60% hydraulics and magnetic
circuit design, 40% mechanics).
for further details concerning the research project, please contact: emanuele.guglielmino at iit.it


development of water hydraulic components and systems for robotics

water hydraulics, which uses water instead of oil as the power transmitting medium, is environmentally
friendly, non-flammable, inexpensive, readily available, and easily disposable. more importantly, when
compared to oil hydraulics, water hydraulics has a quicker response and a higher efficiency. in addition, it is
more stable (in terms of flow velocity and efficiency) over a wide range of operating temperatures due to
water's higher bulk modulus, a lower viscosity and a higher specific heat capacity. all the above mentioned
advantages make water hydraulics appealing in high performance actuation techniques such as robotics.
however, water (as opposed to oil) is more prone to cavitation, poor lubrication, has higher leakage and
requires appropriate materials and design.
the aim of the phd project is to develop water hydraulic components and systems for robotics actuation.
the position will focus on the development of compact, small size and light weight water hydraulic
components (valves and actuators). the research encompasses modelling, simulation, prototyping 
and experimental testing.
technical skills: degree in mechanical/mechatronic/electrical engineering with major in fluid power.

<http://www.iit.it/en/advanced-robotics.html>  ) at the italian
institute of technology (iit) is seeking for several phd candidates to

the themes for the open phd positions are within ongoing or new starting
eu projects in the areas of humanoid systems development, wearable
robotics and soft continuum robots. the abstracts of the themes are
listed below. for further details concerning these research topics,
please contact: nikos.tsagarakis at iit.it

 

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

 

theme 1.1: development of a bi-manual semi-exoskeleton system for
enhanced teleoperation and virtual immersion

 

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis

the sense of touch is crucial in any kind of training or teleoperation
procedures as these actions require the user to extensively engage his
hand and fingers. in the recent years the rapid improvements in hardware
and software to provide effective force/touch feedback has led to the
development of generic haptic devices that have been applied in various
training simulators and teleoperation systems. in most of these
instances the mobility, dexterity and general utility for unencumbered
use are relatively poor. in addition these systems provide only point
contact and cannot address much more complex haptic scenarios where
hands (groping with fingers or manipulation) are used to feel forces of
varying levels while manipulating objects in a large workspace. to be of
any advantage the touch modality should be conveyed to the user in a
natural manner through a highly perceptive and transparent haptic
interface. the development of a multi degree of freedom haptic system
(based on semi-exoskeletal systems) with large working, volume, high
backdrivability and multimodal feedback capability will be the core of
this research. this interface will provide immersive haptic feedback
from a virtual environment or during teleoperation procedures involving
stimulation of proprioceptive and cutaneous nerves centres to provide
data on interaction force, shape, size, texture and contact pressure.

requirements: we are seeking for candidates with a background in
electronic/mechanical engineering or robotics. experience and
competencies in cad mechanical design and good knowledge of robot
kinematics analysis would be a benefit. (mechanical design 50%,
kinematics/optimisation 30%, control 20%)

 

 

theme 1.2. development and control of soft and continuum robot
manipulator inspired by the octopus arm

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr emanuele guglielmino

 

the project focuses on novel design principles and technologies for a
new generation of high dexterity soft bodied robots inspired by the
morphology and behaviour of the octopus. the candidate will work within
an international environment (http://www.octopusproject.eu/) on the
development and control of the actuation modules for the mechatronic
robotic octopus arm. during the first period of the project the
materials and actuation techniques to be used for the development of the
hyper redundant arm will be identified. for the realisation of the
octopus arm both novel and revisited conventional actuation technology
will be explored e.g. micro fluidic actuators, shape memory alloys,
compliant and hybrid actuation.

following the development of the arm different control strategies will
also be identified and evaluated which will allow the soft continuum arm
to execute tasks and motion profiles similar to those observed in the
octopus, e.g. reaching, grasping and fetching.

requirements: applicants ideally should have a background in
electronic/mechanical engineering or computer science. the candidates
should have good competence and be strongly motivated to work with robot
kinematics analysis and control. (mechanical design 30%,
kinematics/control 70%)  

 

 

theme 1.3. development of the next generation of humanoids: exploring
the mechatronic technological limits and new design philosophies

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderborght

 

although significant progress have been made during the last two decades
in the mechatronic development of humanoid robots there are still
significant barriers to be overcome before the body ware (structure,
actuation and sensing) of the humanoid systems approach the performance
of the human body. when compared with humans humanoids significantly
lack in performance and robustness when considering high impact
interactions with the environment either when they are self generated or
accidentally imposed, e.g. falling down. high impact interactions are
required for example during the execution of highly dynamic tasks, e.g.
running at speeds close to those that humans can achieve. these will
require the continues interaction of the robot body with the ground
generating at each cycle high collision forces which cannot be tolerated
by any existing humanoid system. this is because the design approach of
these systems is incompatible with those tasks. the existing humanoid
systems consist of rigid structures and are actuated by highly geared
stiff position servos which impose significant limitations both in the
velocities/torque profiles that can be achieved at the joint level and
in the capability of these systems to absorb the impacts. in addition
the lack of compliance does not allow these robots to make use of the
natural dynamics and storage of energy during the motion cycle. as a
result these robots have higher energy demands since more effort is
required by both the control system and the actuator. the aim of this
research is to improve the performance of the existing humanoid systems
on the aspects discussed above by exploring both the mechatronic
technological limits (structural materials, actuation) and new design
and control philosophies. the outcome of these efforts will be verified
though the development of a highly dynamic bipedal machine targeting to
achieve running speeds close to those achieved by humans while at the
same time demonstrating robustness and adequate tolerance to external
disturbances.

requirements: we are preferably seeking for candidates with a background
in electronic/mechanical engineering or robotics. experience and
competencies in cad mechanical design and good knowledge of robot
kinematics/dynamics would be a benefit. (mechanical design 70%,
dynamics/control 30%)

 

 

theme 1.4 development of the new lower body of the humanoid robot icub
using compliant

actuators

tutor: dr nikos tsagarakis, dr bram vanderborght

 

the humanoid child robot icub has been constructed within the european
consortium robotcub. the legs have 12dof and are powered by electrical
motors and harmonic drives making the joints stiff. however, for energy
efficient and natural walking, humans have compliant joints. at iit
different adaptable compliant actuators and their control architectures
are under development. goal of this phd is to redesign the lower body of
icub to incorporate these compliant actuators. in the initial phase of
the project simulation studies on the lower body will be used to
identify the optimum position of the compliant elements across the leg
kinematic chain. the compliant actuation sources will be designed and
realized using electromechanical arrangements of mechanical elastic
elements and motorized based units. the mechanical characteristics of
these newly developed actuators will be determined through simulation
analysis of the humanoid platform as well as from human biomechanical
data. from these studies parameters such as joint stiffness range,
energy storage capacity and actuator power will be determined and will
be used for the fine tuning of the actuator electromechanical assembly.
following this the compliance solutions developed will be mechanically
shaped to make them compatible with the mechanical morphology of the
icub child humanoid platform. the incorporation of the passive compliant
actuation and the active compliance control into the existing icub lower
body will effectively convert this robot into the first humanoid
platform which will exhibit a fully compliant lower body. following the
mechatronic developments a second objective of the project will be to
develop new control strategies to make benefit of the intrinsic
compliance in order to improve the energy efficiency and the
adaptability of the robot to terrain variations.

requirements: this project is open to two different phd candidates: one
with more interest in control/software aspects and the other in
mechanical/cad design. we are ideally seeking for candidates with a
background in electronic/mechanical engineering or robotics. candidates
should have competencies in cad mechanical design and/or robot dynamics
and control. (mechanical design 60%, dynamics/control 40%)

the successful candidates should have a background in engineering
(mechanical or electrical) or computer science. previous experience of,
or research interests in the following areas would be particularly
relevant: humanoid system development and control, actuators and
mechanisms, compliant systems, haptic systems and interfaces.

http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/documents/position/2009-postdoc-uscomp.html

context:

this post-doctoral position is part of the research project anr contint 
uscomp funded by the french national research agency (anr).
this project involves a collaboration with the visages project-team in 
rennes, lsiit in strasbourg and lirmm in montpellier.
its goal is to provide methodological solutions allowing real-time 
compensation of the motion of living soft tissues during ultrasound 
imaging.

the proposed approach consists in synchronizing the displacement of a 2d 
or 3d ultrasound sensor in such a way to stabilize the observed
image thanks to a robotized probe holder.
this project deals with the complete signal process of the system, 
including perception of the environment and robot control.
the problematic concerns more specially the use in the control scheme of 
the per-operative ultrasound image,
the interaction force between the probe and the soft tissues and the 
measurements of external signals providing the breathing state of the 
patient.

mission:

the main goal of this postdoc is to propose new visual servoing 
techniques based on ultrasound images to automatically synchronize
the displacement of a robotized ultrasound probe with the soft tissue 
motion.

activities of the postdoc are:

- to determine the visual features that can be extracted from live 
segmented ultrasound images
and that are pertinent to perform the robotic task of soft tissue motion 
stabilization.

- to model the interaction that links the variation of the retained 
visual features to the probe displacements.

- to design a kinematic control law using the developed interaction 
model in order to move the robot holding the probe
in such a way to automatically follow a soft tissue element of interest.

- to implement the proposed methods and the developments performed by 
the lirmm and lsiit partners related to the control part of the robotic 
system.
these developments respectively concern the force control of the 
robotized probe and the extension of the control with a predictive 
control scheme
using the measurement of physiological signals of the patient for fast 
motion compensation capability.

the developed methods will be tested and validated on an experimental 
setup made up of an ultrasound probe mounted
on a six degrees of freedom “hyppocrate” medical robot. in first 
experiments a six-axis “adept viper” robot will also be used to apply
simulated physiological motion to ultrasound phantom in order to 
simulate soft tissue motion.
if first results are convincing, experiments on human will be performed 
using the “hyppocrate” safe medical robot.

requirements:

- competences in robotics and in computer vision are strongly required.
- competences in visual servoing, control and image processing are 
highly recommended.
- an excellent practice in c++ programming is also required.

applications:

applications must include a letter of candidature, a brief vitae, a 
publication list and a letter of recommendation.
applications have to be sent by e-mail to alexandre.krupa at irisa.fr

project details
===========
project number: fp7 strep project number 248497
project title: trident: marine robots and dexterous manipulation for  
enabling autonomous underwater multipurpose intervention missions.

abstract
======= 
trident proposes a new methodology for multipurpose underwater  
intervention tasks with diverse potential applications like underwater  
archaeology, oceanography and offshore industries, going beyond  
present-day methods typically based on manned and / or purpose – built  
systems.
a team of two cooperative heterogeneous robots with complementary  
skills,  an autonomous surface craft (asc) and an intervention  
autonomous underwater vehicle (i-auv) endowed with a dexterous  
manipulator, will be used to perform underwater manipulation tasks.  
the proposed methodology is based on two steps.
during the first step, the i-auv is deployed from the asc to perform a  
cooperative path following survey, where it gathers optical/acoustic  
data from the seafloor whilst the asc provides geo-referenced  
navigation data as well as communication with the end user. during  
this phase of the mission the i-auv will be doing accurate path  
following and terrain tracking, to maximize bottom coverage and data  
quality. the motion of the asc will be coordinated with that of the i- 
auv to achieve precise usbl (ultra short base line) positioning and  
reliable acoustic communications. after the survey, the i-auv docks  
with the asc and sends the data back to a ground station where a map  
is set up and a target object is identified by the end user.  at the  
second step, the asc navigates towards a waypoint near the  
intervention area where the i-auv is launched to search for the  
object. when the object (i.e. the target of the intervention) has been  
found, the i-auv switches to free floating navigation mode. the  
manipulation of the object takes place through a dexterous hand  
attached to a redundant robot arm and assisted with proper perception.  
particular emphasis will be put on the research of the vehicles  
intelligent control architecture to provide the embedded knowledge  
representation framework and the high-level reasoning agents required  
to enable a high degree of autonomy and on-board decision making of  
the platform. the new methodology will allow the user to specify an  
intervention task, among a set of predefined ones, to be undertaken  
with regards to a particular target object selected by the end user by  
means of the map previously built. hence the intervention task is seen  
as a semi-automatic process where the target is manually selected but  
then it is automatically recognized and manipulated by the robot in a  
complete autonomous way.
the trident project brings together research skills specific to marine  
environments in navigation and mapping for underwater robotics, multi- 
sensory perception and a range of control techniques relating to  
intelligent control architectures, vehicle-manipulator systems and  
dexterous manipulation.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for auv  
navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to merge  
conventional dvl-fog navigation techniques with the recent results in  
sonar based scan matching in the context of the simultaneous  
localization and mapping techniques in order to setup a consistent and  
accurate elevation map of the seafloor. because sonar can see far  
away, it will be of interest to study how to deal with range scans  
gathered a different altitudes having then a different scale factor.  
hierarchical map structures able to accommodate these measurements  
will be studied.

vacancy 2: autonomous surface craft (asc) – autonomous underwater  
vehicle (auv) cooperative navigation.
=============================================================
the main objective of this work is to investigate how to use  
cooperative navigation techniques to accurately localize one or more  
auvs with the help of a dgps-equipped autonomous surface craft (or  
drifting buoy) being all the vehicles connected by means of low cost,  
low bandwidth acoustic modems. first the scenario of using an usbl in  
a direct configuration (transceiver mounted on the ship) will be  
explored and a solution explicitly taking into account the time delays  
due to the signal transmission will be proposed. then the sensorial  
requirements will be relaxed exploring the possibility of localizing  
the auv with the only help of range measurements (received for free  
with the acoustic data packets) arriving asynchronously from known  
positions (the surface craft pose). a dvl-mru equipped auv will be  
first considered, removing then the requirement of using a dvl.

vacancy 3: intelligent control architecture.
=================================
this vacancy is related with work package 3, which is responsible for  
providing the embedded knowledge representation framework and the high- 
level reasoning agents required to enable autonomy and on-board  
decision making of the platform. autonomous capabilities for  
intervention missions require heterogeneous embedded agents working in  
a dynamic operational field with hard and unpredictable environmental  
conditions. embedded agents specialise in different disciplines  
providing different capabilities or services to the overall system,  
i.e. navigation, mapping, vision, etc. this position will be related  
with the design and implementation of a path-planning agent. the main  
goal is to develop new algorithms for adaptive waypoint-based  
trajectory planning including path following, terrain following and  
obstacle avoidance. as a secondary goal, the work will also contribute  
in the design of an adaptive goal-based mission planning agent.

requirements:
===========
academic: excellent academic grades. knowledge in robotics, video/ 
sonar image processing. previous experience in navigation, mapping,  
slam techniques and/or control architectures will be appreciated. a  
master degree in the related areas will be valuable but not imperative.

558,2009,a research position in cognitive robot hand manipulation,"the intelligent systems & robotics at portsmouth university wishes to appoint a researcher associate in cognitive robot hand manipulation to undertake a recently-funded epsrc project, further application details can be found at http://www.port.ac.uk/vacancies/research/vacancytitle,104518,en.html. a brief introduction of the project is provided as below.

it is evident that service robotics has the potential to improve people's quality of life and it holds the key to a number of unmet applications related to health care and rehabilitation. according to the prediction of international federation of robotics, the global market for intelligent service robots is forecast to reach 24.3 billion usd worldwide by 2010. a multi-fingered robotic hand is the most complex and dexterous robotic system, whose development represents frontiers in service robotics research. recent innovations in motor technology and robotics have achieved impressive results in the hardware of robotic hands such as robonaut hand. however, the manipulation systems of robotic hands are hardcoded to handle specific objects in specific ways, which significantly limits their transfer to a range of different situations and applications. the control and optimisation problems involved in robot hand manipulation are very difficult to solve in mathematical terms, however humans solve their hand manipulation related tasks easily using skill and experience. object manipulation algorithms are required to meet the market requirement that robot hand systems should have human-like manipulation capabilities and be independent of robot hand hardware. hence, the main challenge that researchers now face is how to enable robot hands to use what can be learned from human hands, to manipulate objects, with the same degree of skill and delicacy as human hands. the proposed work aims to investigate artificial intelligence (ai) methodologies and practical solutions which will allow robotic hands to automatically adapt to human environments and thus to enable them to autonomously perform useful manipulation tasks involved in daily living, potentially for health care and rehabilitation applications. the investigation will focus on the following areas.

1) to generate a series of responsive human-like finger gaits for a robotic hand given an object to manipulate. this will have the capability to iteratively build a knowledge base representing the features of human hand manipulation behaviour and to efficiently provide corresponding robot hand gaits and manipulation strategies for a given manipulation task in a human environment.

2) to develop feasible friction models for the interaction of objects and a robot/human hand. this will enable the application of existing mathematical research findings in multifingered robot manipulation to realworld applications in human environments and will integrate related methods in engineering and ai domains.

3) to develop an ai-based control architecture to ensure robust object manipulation of multifingered robots in terms of manipulation feasibility and efficiency. this will allow robot hands to perform stable human-like object grasping and manipulation and will also provide an open architecture which has the potential to introduce human brain (eeg/mri signals) and human muscles (emg signals) information into robotic hand systems.

4) to validate the proposed algorithms by implementing these into a set of defined scenarios with a set of simulated multifingered robot hands and three different types of physical robot hands."

robotics (isir) (http://www.isir.upmc.fr/) university of paris pierre et
marie curie (upmc)–paris 6 (http://www.upmc.fr/) under prof. edwige
pissaloux supervision (edwige.pissaloux at upmc.fr)


the position will be founded within the frame of a fp7 ict european project.

thesis title is “detection and tracking of 3d scene features”.

thesis summary.

 the isir (institute of intelligent systems & robotics) (former
laboratoire de robotique de paris) of the upmc (university pierre and
marie curie, former paris 6 university), through various national,
european and international research projects, studies neuro-cognitive
human-space interaction in order to design and realize prototypes of
intelligent systems, robotics and mechatronics systems, highly autonomous
and/or able to assist healthy and handicapped in performing everyday life
tasks.
 the ability to interact with the environment, and especially to move in
it, is a key element for human and robot autonomy. the autonomous
navigation seems to be mainly supported by vision and balance which,
conveniently combined, allow the elaboratation of adequate motor stimulis
for the interaction progressing.
the precise process of human vision and balance data combination when
navigating is unknown; however it is hypothesized that the vision detectes
& helps to memorizes 3d scene (not only geometric) features, while balance
selects pertinent features and tracks them in image sequence.

this thesis aims to design and prototype a system - a new nomad
eye-tracker- which detects and tracks image geometric and cognitive
features of a 3d scene when navigating, ie. which determines the gaze
direction of subject carrying the system at any time. new hardware system
will be designed and prototyped with commercially available components.
the dedicated software will encompass new and spatio-temporal optimized
algorithms for feature detection and tracking and for vision & inertial
data combination; both classes of the algorithms could be bases upon
present knowledge of neuro-cognitive sciences for which a new
computational models will be designed.
a new nomad eye-tracker will be validated through real applications which
aim to assist the interactions of arm and hand motor handicapped people in
execution of everyday tasks. finally the designed system (simulating
partly the human head) will be integrated in the asterics system.


key words: feature and gaze detection and tracking in images and 3d

            ***** phd student position available *****

       center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     orebro university,  sweden 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.


about orebro university:

orebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university currently enrolling
more than 15,000 students.  it is located in orebro, a city of 130,000
inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the aass mobile robotics lab is one of the three research groups within
the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass).  aass carries
out multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science,
and measurement technology.  the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come from a dozen different
countries, in europe and worldwide, and have different scientific and
cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently hosts international
researchers and is involved in several international projects.  this
means, particularly in the gert project, that the enrolled phd student
will have the opportunity to travel and to cooperate with people in
other countries.

the aass mobile robotics lab is internationally renowned for its
research in cognitive robots, robot ecologies and artificial olfaction.
further information can be found at www.aass.oru.se/research/robots/.

the student will work under the joint supervision of alessandro saffiotti
and lars karlsson.  the student will receive a monthly salary adequate to
the cost of living in  sweden , and will be included in the swedish social
security system.


prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a clear interest in the research topic, to a strong
theoretical background in computer science, and to solid programming
skills, the applicant should have a masters or equivalent degree in an
appropriate field (including computer science, computer engineering, or
robotics).  knowledge of the swedish language is not required, but
proficiency in written/spoken english is mandatory.  candidates with
previous experience in artificial intelligence or in robotics will be
preferred.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <asaffio at aass.oru.se>.  applications can be
sent immediately and until january 31, 2010.  we are looking forward to
receiving your application!

 how can a robot learn to perceive an unknown sensorimotor world,
 and learn to act effectively in it? 

 how can it start with pixel-level perception and motor babbling,
 and create its own higher-level concepts of objects and actions
 applied to them, and places and motions connecting them? 

 what primitive capabilities should the individual learner possess,
 and how could these be learned over evolutionary time?

 what are suitable hierarchical representations for the 3d structure
 of object instances or classes that can be exploited for recognition
 and action affordances?

 how can different kinds of spatial constraints be used for joint
 recognition of scenes and the objects within them?

we invite applications for a post-doctoral position at the university 
of michigan to address these and related problems, working with two 
faculty researchers (benjamin kuipers and silvio savarese), four 
graduate research assistants, and others in our laboratories.  this

578,2009,"postdoctoral position at laas-cnrs, toulouse, france","this postdoc topic concerns the perception of natural environment by 
heterogeneous robots (unmanned aerial and ground vehicles). the 
postdoctoral researcher will participate to the rosace project funded by 
the rtra stae (in french, fondation de coopération scientifique, 
sciences et technologies pour l'aéronautique et l'espace) : rosace 
studies how a set of mobile autonomous communicating and cooperating 
robots could be deployed with well-established properties particularly 
in terms of safety, self-healability, ability to achieve a set of 
missions and self-adaptation in a dynamic environment. concerning 
robotics, the objective consists in studying and developing distributed 
robotics functions to be integrated on aerial and terrestrial robots.

rosace partners have defined a common scenario about rescue robotics, on 
which every research team must propose functions, multi-robot strategies 
and, when possible, experiments either in simulation or with true robots :
- rescue robotics : an alert occurs about an accident or a possible 
disaster on a large area (e.g. a forest fire) ! an emergency service 
deploys robots, both with human-controlled vehicles.
- an a priori map is known on the area, but, this map must be considered 
as uncertain (new buildings, new roads …) … moreover due to the 
disaster, some roads are probably cut off by obstacles.
- robots must cooperate in order to detect some situations (e.g. fire, 
humans or vehicles in dangerous area…) and to help people (e.g. guide 
humans towards safe areas)
- a communication network is deployed in the environment, but with a 
limited bandwidth and with partial connectivity between nodes (humans 
and robots).
- gps is available, but navigation cannot be completely based on 
gps-based localization (not accurate enough, possible occultations …)

such a scenario gives only an applicative context in order to study 
scientific topics in robotics, multi-agents systems, ai, ad hoc network, 
fault tolerant systems ….

this postdoc topics is focused on mapping from several heterogeneous 
robots, using a priori information on a large area to be explored. the 
postdoc will be integrated in the robotics and ai department of 
laas-cnrs in toulouse (http://www.laas.fr), but will have to cooperate 
with the dcsd department at onera also in toulouse.

some keywords only to give a general context : environment modelling, 3d 
heterogeneous representations (dem, landmarks, specific objects to be 
identified like roads, rivers. buildings, fire…), slam, multiple and 
heterogeneous maps, large environment, vision, multi-robots cooperation, 
network connectivity…

a recent phd is required. applicants should possess knowledge and 
experience in slam, 3d vision, data association, estimation… appointment 
will be initially for a 12 months duration, eventually extended for 12 
other months. the position is available now : the postdoc may start as 
soon as possible.
