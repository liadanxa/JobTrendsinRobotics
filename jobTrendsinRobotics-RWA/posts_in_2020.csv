visualization technologies of eodyne in the virtual reality environment xim (experience induction machine) and the neuroinformatics software brainx3 1 (in collaboration with prof. paul verschure and the specs-lab at the institute of bioengineering of catalonia, barcelona,  spain ), this phd project propose to build a unified simulation platform for the reconstruction and analysis of brain dynamics and connectivity at multiple scales describing the human brain in health and disease. we will in particular address the question of how discrete lesions due to stroke affect the global (re)organization of the neocortex and the thalamo-cortical system. overall, the project will advance the modeling of the dynamics of (sub-)cortical structures through their embedding in more realistic empirically grounded large-scale cortical networks and improve clinical diagnostics and intervention planning. main tasks and responsibilities:   *   building and testing models of cortical plasticity in healthy brains and those with stroke within the context of broader brain systems;   *   mapping and graph-theoretically quantifying patterns of connectivity related to the core networks of the brain and their relation to perceptual and cognitive functions;   *   investigating how these circuits are disrupted in disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (tbi), and coma;   *   identify mappings between structural network properties and functional dynamics.   *   at the end of the phd project, it is expected to have a multi-scale integrated brain model for the human brain, serving research, clinical applications and education within and beyond the phd. skills and qualifications:   *   bachelor (bsc) and master (msc) in physics/ mathematics/ biology/ biomedical   *

but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system. for information about the positions, contact profs jo eidsvik (jo.eidsvik at ntnu.no) or kanna rajan (kanna.rajan at ntnu.no)"

but now instead of viking raiders and hanseatic traders, you'll find jazz musicians and an international student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway . with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system. for information about the positions, contact profs jo eidsvik (jo.eidsvik at ntnu.no <mailto:jo.eidsvik at ntnu.no>) or kanna rajan (kanna.rajan at ntnu.no <mailto:kanna.rajan at ntnu.no>)"

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies - experimental validation: the intended benchmark will consist of at  least two drones manipulating a single soft rod with the aim of imposing  a desired shape to the rod and to displace it to a desired location. the  final experiment will represent a first concrete step towards the full  grasping of an object with the system uavs+soft body. for this, we are  going to consider the following scenario: surrounding a vertical pole  with the soft body as in the following illustration *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving on the methodological and experimental  sides. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the armen team https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ls2n.fr/equipe/armen/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfulyhzz8i$  is creating original research results in design, control and perception  in the field of autonomous robots and of the control of their  interactions with the environment. designing and controlling systems  able to address the two facets of the term environment (in the sense of  the environment in which the robot evolves or in the ecological sense of  the term) are two priority objectives of the team. the main issues  addressed concern the control of the dynamics of robotic systems and  their environment, the gain in autonomy and the minimization of the  environmental impact. the facilities available in the group include a fleet of autonomous  industrial cars, a platform for prototyping industrial-size industrial  and aerial robots, a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing  arena instrumented with qualisys motion capture system. the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfurq-1tcx$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experience in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision, shared control, haptics and sensor-based  control for robotics applications. the facilities available in the group  include three 6-dof industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof  torque-controlled backdrivable arm, two 7-dof torque-controlled robot  arms (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a humanoid robot (pepper),  a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with  vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. s. briot* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/*briot-s/__;fg!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfugegqy9q$  *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfupsyp9ob$  and *prof. a. chriette* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/abdelhamid*20chriette/__;jq!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfugf1lyac$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the armen and  rainbow teams involved in the project. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply to each position can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/manip-soft-drone/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfuqxzj7ed$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfupsyp9ob$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!_dwbyrnii9njljx2_yfayxbbistbj1f2bdjusszyrdx2l5yybyrwbvg9biuemtzfumf5qyrk$ "

robots the smart innovative training network is recruiting 15 motivated phd students. smart is a joint venture between academia and industry, providing scientific and personal development of young researchers in the multidisciplinary fields of soft robotics and smart materials. smart will realize the technologically and scientifically ambitious breakthroughs to exploit smart, stimuli-responsive material systems with actuation, sensing and self-healing capabilities for intelligent soft devices. this allows the soft robots to interact with dynamic and unknown environments in a smart fashion to avert catastrophic failure and re-establish structural integrity and operational functionality. control intelligence enables interaction with the outer world and structural health monitoring allows the establishment of autonomous healing procedures, where upon sensing of damage or loss of functionality the system will cease operation and start a repair action, followed by the evaluation of the effective recovery of functionality and finally return to operation, thus expanding the service lifetime. these technologies will be integrated in fully functional and autonomous demonstrators to disseminate, benchmark and exploit the results. there is a need for future leaders with excellence in smart material systems and technologically advanced applications such as robotics and automation. the smart itn offers such multidisciplinary training by combining these two emerging fields with meaningful societal and economic impact (t-model). for this purpose, smart brings together 8

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies - experimental validation: the intended benchmark will consist of at  least two drones manipulating a single soft rod with the aim of imposing  a desired shape to the rod and to displace it to a desired location. the  final experiment will represent a first concrete step towards the full  grasping of an object with the system uavs+soft body. for this, we are  going to consider the following scenario: surrounding a vertical pole  with the soft body as in the following illustration *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving on the methodological and experimental  sides. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the armen team https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ls2n.fr/equipe/armen/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuwuxawqa$  is creating original research results in design, control and perception  in the field of autonomous robots and of the control of their  interactions with the environment. designing and controlling systems  able to address the two facets of the term environment (in the sense of  the environment in which the robot evolves or in the ecological sense of  the term) are two priority objectives of the team. the main issues  addressed concern the control of the dynamics of robotic systems and  their environment, the gain in autonomy and the minimization of the  environmental impact. the facilities available in the group include a fleet of autonomous  industrial cars, a platform for prototyping industrial-size industrial  and aerial robots, a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing  arena instrumented with qualisys motion capture system. the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcua2e1dny$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experience in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision, shared control, haptics and sensor-based  control for robotics applications. the facilities available in the group  include three 6-dof industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof  torque-controlled backdrivable arm, two 7-dof torque-controlled robot  arms (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a humanoid robot (pepper),  a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with  vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. s. briot* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/*briot-s/__;fg!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuaedr1kj$  *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuydx6cgm$  and *prof. a. chriette* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/abdelhamid*20chriette/__;jq!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuvkzjzoe$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the armen and  rainbow teams involved in the project. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply to each position can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/manip-soft-drone/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuumx3f2r$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuydx6cgm$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4urrnq0lbt2uwqbkffxwyuzvbx7q--rodl2e56wvkshnwxfdlo0mnycnx7mm1trcuregogum$ "

8654,2020,full-time international phd position at  university college dublin  ireland  ," phd  ireland  : develop a framework using machine learning (ml) to identify specific features of stress response using plant phenotyping background:early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant for food security but methodologically complex. plant stress responses can be observed using non-invasive methods such as plant imaging. the use of different camera sensors such as rgb, hyperspectral and chlorophyll fluorescence enable the detection of altered plant performance in response to environmental stress. such changes include slower growth, senescent changes in the spectral reflectance and modified fluorescence responses of leaves. although these changes cannot be captured by human eye, the imaging sensors used in this project can perceive such changes very fast. to understand the early responses of plants to environmental stress, we will develop a framework of data collection, storage and curation, trait extraction and utilization of ml and classification algorithms to extract the features from plant images. plant images will be collected using imaging platforms in a controlled environment and unmanned aerial vehicles in field conditions(uavs). project:this exciting project will develop a specific framework that utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization and visualisation to identify specific features of stress response using thousands of plant images. the ph.d. student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by assoc. prof. eleni mangina from ucd- school of computer science and assist. prof. dr. snia negro (ucd- school of

a critical role in defining offspring health, both in childhood and in later life. according to the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) hypothesis, transient environmental exposures during critical periods of development (such as the pre-conceptional, fetal and early infant phases of life) can alter the health trajectory of the offspring. maternal diet is a modifiable behaviour that could play an important role in maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. novel findings from our individual birth cohort studies and the alphabet consortium highlight the potential influence of maternal dietary quality and inflammatory potential during pregnancy on birth outcomes and a range of offspring childhood health outcomes. however limited data regarding the interrelationships between maternal diet and lifestyle, placental development and birth and childhood outcomes in humans exist. project: this exciting project will address this gap in the knowledge base by harnessing information on maternal diet &amp; lifestyle and pregnancy/birth/offspring outcomes using existing databases and analysis of biological samples from several birth cohort studies. the phd student will have the opportunity to participate in training courses, workshops and conferences. the research will be supervised by dr catherine phillips, assistant professor and lead principal investigator for this research programme at the school of public health, physiotherapy and sports science, university college dublin. details: this is a 4-year full-time position, open to eu and non-eu candidates, with a stipend of 18,000 per annum.  qualifications: candidates should hold a bachelor's degree in nutrition, biological sciences (physiology, developmental biology, reproduction), public health or related field and have an interest in early life/fetal programming, nutrition and metabolic health. experience in pregnancy and childhood research, epigenetics or nutritional assessment techniques would be desirable.  application process: informal enquiries are welcome and should be directed to dr. catherine phillips (catherine.phillips at ucd.ie). applications including a detailed cv, letter of motivation (max 2 pages, single spaced), transcripts and two letters of recommendation (to be sent directly from referee) should be sent to catherine.phillips at ucd.ieno later than march 23rd 2020. 	phd opportunity: dietary sugars / sweeteners during pregnancy and their impact on long term maternal metabolic and reproductive health background: there is significant evidence that an unhealthy diet greatly increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and predisposes offspring to metabolic dysfunction and obesity. while fat intake is typically associated with the onset of obesity and its comorbidities, there is increasing evidence linking sugar, particularly high fructose corn syrup, to the global rise in obesity rates. furthermore the detrimental effects of fructose intake during pregnancy on mother and child have been clearly outlined. despite their wide availability there is only limited information regarding their impact on maternal pregnancy outcomes, placental/fetal development and long term risk of cardio-metabolic complications in the mother. previous work from the group has demonstrated that the artificial sweetener ace-k increases insulin resistance during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. this project will investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners in combination with a high fat diet during pregnancy on maternal obesity, metabolic and reproductive health during successive pregnancies. this project will provide training in key laboratory skills ranging from rodent physiology, biochemical, cellular and molecular techniques. training in experimental design, data analysis and scientific writing will also be provided. this project would be ideal for a student with a background in a biological science (nutrition, physiology, reproduction, biochemistry) with a keen interested in nutrition and metabolic health. funding information:this is a 4-year full-time position with a stipend of e18,000 per annum. how to

7007856 phd opportunity: ""the role of soil micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat"" university college dublin (ucd) together with origin enterprises plc have established a new collaborative science foundation ireland (sfi) strategic partnership research programme, entitled consus, focussed on the application of precision agriculture to crop production with a particular emphasis on optimisation of agri-food production systems leading to more efficient food production with lower environmental impacts. the outcomes from this research programme will deliver a step-change in crop agronomy tools and practices, leading to enhanced global competitiveness. applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a 4-year phd studentship with the consus team researching crop nutrition and limits to yield potential. globally, major gains in crop yield and quality have been made through the application of the major plant nutrients (macronutrients) such as n, p and k in fertilizer. however, with the supply of adequate levels of these macronutrients, concentrations of micronutrients, such as zn, cu and mn, in soil and plant can drop below optimum and become yield- and quality-limiting. this is particularly the case in more intensive cropping systems with higher yields and removal of micronutrients in exported plant materials. fertilizer n is a major variable input cost to most conventional farming systems. in addition, poor use efficiency can increase the risk of loss to the wider environment, and associated impacts on water quality, air quality, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. this phd will use laboratory and field experimental approaches to develop an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of micronutrients in n cycling and n use efficiency in winter wheat. this position will be in the ucd school of agriculture and food science

commonly associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs. in humans, most hev infections cause an acute, self-limiting hepatitis. however, severe disease can occur, particularly in pregnant women or those with pre-existing liver disease. hev infection is also associated with other disease manifestations including neurological disease, however the reason why severe disease occurs is poorly understood. currently, there are no specific treatments for hev, and there is no licenced vaccine in europe. hev is extremely challenging to propagate in cell culture, and there is no robust method to screen food products for the presence of infectious virus. this project will aim to develop in vitro and ex vivo models for the study of hev, and to use these systems to investigate the biology of this virus in pigs and humans. the student will work with an interdisciplinary team at ucd, based at the veterinary sciences centre, and will have the opportunity to develop their research skills in one health and zoonotic disease. the student will collaborate with research groups at ucd, the university of birmingham and pirbright institute in the uk, and the cleveland clinic,

post doc position, please write to prof. rafael sacks, atcvsacks at technion.ac.il the design and use of technology has serious implications for society as a whole. there is increasing public concern about issues such as anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of military and surveillance technologies, and the possible impacts of automation and artificial intelligence. however, decisions about technological systems are often made without transparency or democratic oversight. engineers bear much of the responsibility for the development, construction, and maintenance of technological systems, but in whose interests do they act? engineering institutions claim to be committed to public welfare, but can engineers really balance that commitment with meeting the demands of employers and clients? there is in fact evidence to suggest that the culture of engineering education and professional practice discourages engineers from placing sufficient importance on public welfare. further research is needed in this area; this phd will address that need by exploring the relationship between engineering, professional responsibility, and public welfare. both qualitative and quantitative approaches will be used to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of engineering students and professionals in ireland, as well as the contexts in which these engineers study and work. applications for this phd scholarship are invited from candidates from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, including but not limited to sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography, education, and design. candidates should have or expect to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree in their field. please direct any queries about the project or application to donal.holland at ucd.ie. scholarship: the scholarship covers all academic fees and includes a stipend of 15,000 per annum for four years and a travel budget to allow attendance at conferences. how to apply: please submit a cv and cover letter explaining your interest in the project to donal.holland at ucd.ie. 3d printing (additive manufacturing), is increasing being applied for the fabrication of medical devices. one of the advantages of the technology is its ability to tailor the design, to meet specific patient needs. given the individualized part printing however, a key consideration is to ensure the quality of the printed device. this phd project will involve the printing of both polymeric and fibre reinforced polymer composites, for use in prosthetic devices. the printing will be carried out using both a laboratory and a pilot scale fused filament fabrication system. the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the printed parts will be extensively investigated and correlated with the processing conditions. a number of advanced process diagnostic techniques (including optical imagining), will be used to monitor the printing process. working closely with colleagues in computer science, the data collected will be analysed, in order to provide process feedback. the objective is to determine if the in-process measurements can be correlated with print defects (i.e. porosity), and where possible can help to predict the formation of defects before they occur. funding: scholarship support for this phd is through the science foundationi-form advanced manufacturing research centre. phd funding is available for eu students only. applicant requirement: a minimum of a 2.1 honours degree in engineering, chemistry, physics or materials science. application: to apply, please submit a cv and cover letter to prof. denis dowling, i-form centre, university college dublin (denis.dowling at ucd.ie). closing date for applications monday,6th january 2020. marie skodowska curie

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies - experimental validation: the intended benchmark will consist of at  least two drones manipulating a single soft rod with the aim of imposing  a desired shape to the rod and to displace it to a desired location. the  final experiment will represent a first concrete step towards the full  grasping of an object with the system uavs+soft body. for this, we are  going to consider the following scenario: surrounding a vertical pole  with the soft body as in the following illustration *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving on the methodological and experimental  sides. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the armen team https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ls2n.fr/equipe/armen/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8qelou5l$  is creating original research results in design, control and perception  in the field of autonomous robots and of the control of their  interactions with the environment. designing and controlling systems  able to address the two facets of the term environment (in the sense of  the environment in which the robot evolves or in the ecological sense of  the term) are two priority objectives of the team. the main issues  addressed concern the control of the dynamics of robotic systems and  their environment, the gain in autonomy and the minimization of the  environmental impact. the facilities available in the group include a fleet of autonomous  industrial cars, a platform for prototyping industrial-size industrial  and aerial robots, a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing  arena instrumented with qualisys motion capture system. the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8tjwzkrv$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experience in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision, shared control, haptics and sensor-based  control for robotics applications. the facilities available in the group  include three 6-dof industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof  torque-controlled backdrivable arm, two 7-dof torque-controlled robot  arms (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a humanoid robot (pepper),  a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with  vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. s. briot* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/*briot-s/__;fg!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8jezhc1h$  *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8qckcs8m$  and *prof. a. chriette* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/abdelhamid*20chriette/__;jq!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8monpkej$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the armen and  rainbow teams involved in the project. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply to each position can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/manip-soft-drone/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8udgwyby$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8qckcs8m$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4sn3mwe-ry6krtiy3axyegl5jmzo_amqnjn3zzn-uy14aust4ppi9rpeplpapz7w8mafybqn$ "

a joint venture between academia and industry, providing scientific and personal development of young researchers in the multidisciplinary fields of soft robotics and smart materials. smart will realize the technologically and scientifically ambitious breakthroughs to exploit smart, stimuli-responsive material systems with actuation, sensing and self-healing capabilities for intelligent soft devices. this allows the soft robots to interact with dynamic and unknown environments in a smart fashion to avert catastrophic failure and re-establish structural integrity and operational functionality. control intelligence enables interaction with the outer world and structural health monitoring allows the establishment of autonomous healing procedures, where upon sensing of damage or loss of functionality the system will cease operation and start a repair action, followed by the evaluation of the effective recovery of functionality and finally return to operation, thus expanding the service lifetime. these technologies will be integrated in fully functional and autonomous demonstrators to disseminate, benchmark and exploit the results. there is a need for future leaders with excellence in smart material systems and technologically advanced applications such as robotics and automation. the smart itn offers such multidisciplinary training by combining these two emerging fields with meaningful societal and economic impact (t-model). for this purpose, smart brings together 8 beneficiaries and 11 partner organizations including 2 research institutes and 12 private companies, belonging to 7 eu member states, and to 2 associated states (switzerland, turkey). the consortium?s complementarity and multidisciplinarity will enable a top-level educational programme,

exhibiting new  physiological functions, biological characteristics or reconstitution  properties directly inspired from natural processes occurring in the  human organism. however, developing these drug cells necessitates  extracting a few lymphocytes from a blood sample, using fluidic chips  actuated by various physical effects. among the actuation techniques,  dielectrophoresis (dep) is largely used. it acts on neutral but  polarized cell placed on an inhomogeneous electric field [2]. the femto-st institute aims at proposing an optimization methodology to  design electrodes for fluidic chips actuated by electric fields. _objectives:_ the goal of one-year this post doctoral position is to use a topology  optimization method to design three-dimensional electrodes to generate  electric fields, in order to sort cells based on dielectrophoretic  effects. the methods for topology optimization, especially simp method  (solid isotropic material with penalization) are conceptuals tool aiming  to find an optimal structure within a limited design domain [1]. based  on material distribution, it consists to minimize an objective function  while subjected to one or several constraints. concretely, the method  combines finite element formulation and penalization power law to make  material intermediate density unattractive and therefore avoid the 0-1  problem of classical topology optimization approaches. in addition, the  method is easy to implement and commonly employed in classical  mechanical engineering. as reported, [2] explored the possibility of  applying this method to design 2d electrodes. with this aim in mind, we  target here to go further by extending the method for the design of  electrodes dedicated to active lab on chips. the originality of this  proposal lies on the development and topological design of innovative 3d  electrodes, for both actuation and sensing. to reach this objective, both scientific and technological barriers have  to be lifted. the scientific approach consists to combine (i) simp  method that leads to systematic and methodological designs by  distributing a limited amount of material and (ii) the physics of  dielectrophoresis. on the basis of pre-defined criteria in terms of  size, electrical field distribution, sensitivity, etc., the proposed  approach will lead to efficient and compact 3d electrodes. this work  will benefit from the recent development of analytical models dedicated  to compute the distribution of the electric field, and the  dielectrophoretic force and torque made in femto-st [3], [4]. in  addition to this challenging scientific aspect, the proposed methods  will be validated experimentally. doing so, this project aims to take an  important step towards the design and the fabrication of innovative  active cell-sorting devices. _references:_ [1] m. p. bendsoe and o. sigmund, ?topology optimization: theory,  methods and applications?. springer, feb. 2004.

8748,2020,open postdoc position in robotic  autonomy for satellites at onera," a project, leaded by airbus defence and space, is aimed at developing a constellation of mini-satellites of earth observation satellites (optic). in this context, studies to improve the autonomy of each satellite within the constellation are planned, in order to make the overall constellation management more flexible (for instance prospective assumptions like inter satellite links for control or data transfer could be made). the main objective is to specify and develop a satellite control architecture which will allow that some activities to be performed autonomously on board instead of in the ground mission segment, like for instance create or adapt the sequence of image acquisitions from customers? requests or how to select and download recorded images to reception stations. this work will re-use concepts already put into application by onera in autonomous robotic applications (ground/aerial/naval). keywords are modularity based on mission decomposition into tasks and further refinements. existing developments based on python/ros2 seems difficult to use directly in a space application, so they should be transposed taken into account strong requirements about onboard satellite flight systems (os, language) to provide control architecture implementations. depending on the background profile of the candidate, work can be focused on control architecture or on onboard planning algorithms.  profile and skills required : robotic control architecture, robotic planning, optimization, knowledge of c/c++, real-time os post doc page (in french) <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://w3.onera.fr/formationparlarecherche/sites/w3.onera.fr.formationparlarecherche/files/pdoc-dtis-2020-05.pdf__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!57umhf3yusuivbmuhaokuac1lmpy8ymrau7nuoldqszeb9zdrbnt5s0myaqlqpqyune_5-de$ >   - eric bensana dtis/seas t?l: +33 5 62 25 29 01  email : eric.bensana at onera.fr onera - the french aerospace lab - centre de toulouse 2, avenue edouard belin - bp 74025 - 31055 toulouse cedex -- sent from: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!57umhf3yusuivbmuhaokuac1lmpy8ymrau7nuoldqszeb9zdrbnt5s0myaqlqpqyub3ee8xp$ "

8759,2020,postdoc - sensor-based real-time  control of industrial robots in robotic 3d printing of concrete materials," *subject:*  a recent trend in construction is to introduce digitally based construction method such as 3d printing in order to accelerate the production rate, improve the security of workers, and provide design freedom to architects. cement-based materials 3d printing is beginning to be well documented [1-8]. among the developed techniques, extrusion-based additive manufacturing methods have been the most studied [1-5]. in this technique, the successive layers of concrete are deposited by a robot to build a complete structure. it is important to note that the success of this process is based on a competition between the material structural build-up rate and the construction rate [5,7]: the deposited material must be hard enough to support the increasing load induced by subsequently deposited layers of the ??in process? construction.  on the robotic hand, there are industrial applications where a perfect control of the final geometry of the printed workpieces is essential. some of these industrial applications require that the working tool (nozzle) has the ability to follow the contour of a prefabricated piece during printing operation with a control of the lay down speed, and then extruded shape dimensions, according to changes in the rheological behavior of the extruded material. an off-line planning of the robot system is not sufficient to meet these demands. real-time control and thus sensor integration are required.  studies and tests over the issue have led us to design a 3d printer composed of the combination of a 6-axis industrial robot designed by sta?bli robotics (load capacity of 195 kg) with a tp5 giema electric pump designed for mortar/render application (maximum pressure of 20 bar, maximum flow rate of 40 l/min) [9]. to make the system more flexible, we proposed an automatic offline programming solution of the robot 3d printer based on a combination of cad files of the workpieces to be slice into thin layers and the robodk?s offline programming tool which convert the manufacturing programs obtained (g-code) to robot programs free of singularities, axis limits and avoiding collisions. in the resulting configuration, the robot can follow a defined trajectory. to make the system more tolerant to the process, the focus of this thesis is on the real-time interaction between the deposited layers and the robot.  the objective of the proposed project is to design and evaluate a sensor interface, demonstrating the possibilities of real-time robot control within 3d printing of concrete materials. the main idea is to design a system which integrates different sensors and control algorithms to show the possibilities of moving the robot on a defined trajectory while controlling the printed geometry layer and tracking accurately local surroundings. common systems use vision sensors or laser-based system [10].  effort will be made on the practical implementation of the test platform for the experimental evaluations of the real-time interface on an industrial application case. it is important to note that the success of this process is based the ability to control the expected geometry of the concrete layers and the mechanical properties of the printed samples. subsequent geometrical control and mechanical testing (compressive, stress cycle, porosity, ...) of the final structures should be performed.  *forward schedule:* although this scientific field has been widely studied in recent years within the scientific community, we believe that the application and validation of these methods for 3d printing of concrete by industrial robots requires new contributions. this project is very transversal and multidisciplinary. we therefore believe that a training period on the different topics covered as well as on what exists in the team (prototypes, simulation control method, consequent software environment...) is necessary.  then we propose a program that alternates between scientific contributions and the implementation of prototypes or demonstrators that attest to the feasibility of the contributions exhibited.  ?	t0+3m: training period on the different topics covered as well as on what exists in the team (prototypes, simulation control method, consequent software environment...)  ?	t0+3m: bibliographic study for the scientific problem under consideration. ?	t0+6m: choices of sensors and control strategies ?	t0+9m: selection of software and hardware solutions. analyze the real-time characteristics of the control system including the sensors and the robot.  ?	t0+12m: realization of a test platform for the demonstration and evaluation of the proposed sensor robot control.  ?	t0+18m: data-fusion to achieve a real-time robot control during the 3d printing process. this project being multidisciplinary, it requires the skills and expertise of a number of researchers with whom we are already collaborating (irdl). *the project lasts 18 months and aims to host a post-doctoral student who has spent at least 18 months abroad between 1 may 2017 and the start of the project (no later than 1 december 2020).* *applicant profile* university background: phd -mechanical modeling, analysis, and simulation knowledge -robotics modelling and kinematic knowledge -skills and knowledge on data fusion techniques, and vision based control -programming skills (matlab, c++ knowledge) *laboratory: * laboratoire de g?nie civil et g?nie m?canique ea-3913 axe th?matique : etalonnage et commande des syst?mes robotis?s	lieu : rennes	 responsable d?unit?

people feelings and emotionally reflect upon them, shapes social interaction and it is important in both personal and professional success. although, some progress has been achieved in developing systems that detect emotions based on facial expressions and physiological data, a way of relating and reflecting upon them is far more challenging. therefore, understanding how empathy/emotional responses emerge via complex information processing between key brain regions is of paramount importance to develop emotionally-aware ai agents. in this project, we will exploit real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) neurofeedback techniques to build cognitive models that explain modulation of brain activity in key regions related to empathy and emotions. this approach would extract how brain regions interact during neuromodulation and allow cognitive models to emerge in real-time. subsequently, to allow training in more naturalistic environments we suggest cross-domain learning between fmri and eeg. more details can be found: https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://fdeligianni.site/aicognmodels.html__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7ofkcvnxitw_xvmtxdum268zaalepilxrbc2cikdvyqeskeap6196ppv3ituukd91v2eysos$  https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://socialcdt.org/application/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7ofkcvnxitw_xvmtxdum268zaalepilxrbc2cikdvyqeskeap6196ppv3ituukd91qvbjnzm$  --- fani deligianni, phd lecturer, 321b sir alwyn williams building, school of computing science, glasgow university https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/fanideligianni/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7ofkcvnxitw_xvmtxdum268zaalepilxrbc2cikdvyqeskeap6196ppv3ituukd91tzrpykp$ "

in case of interest, please apply until july 22nd.  ------------- assignment the goal of this post doc project is to investigate strategies to extract useful information from residual muscle activity in upper limbs of persons with tetraplegia with emg sensors. this information will be used to decode user intent for controlling an upper limb hybrid neuroprosthesis. the hybrid neuroprosthesis, actuated by both motors and fes systems, will aid persons with tetraplegia to perform functional activities, such as grasping. it will be necessary to process real time emg signals with state-of-the-art techniques, such as machine learning and wavelets, to filter stimulation artefacts and other unwanted signals, and to classify muscle contractions according to the user intent. the candidate will work mainly on the emg processing, however the involvement on other areas, such as actuation, would be well regarded. ---------------- main activities the first step will consist in familiarization with the current knowledge of emg signal processing and classification, as well as with clinical trials and protocols. a review of the state-of-the-art will be done on the technical and clinical fields linked to subject, including the recent works by the camin team.  the candidate will then explore, test and choose between a series of design decision for the system, such as number of channels, filters, classification techniques, signal acquisition protocols, and so on. automatic learning methods will be explored and develop. the candidate will be also advise on the experimental setup and proper equipment. this project is very user focused and a comprehensive user requirements document must be prepared. the candidate will take part in the process of obtaining approval for experiments by an ethical committee. by the end of the project period, a mature system capable of outputting useful command signals for a functional hybrid neuroprosthesis for persons with tetraplegia should be available. this will be validated through clinical trials with patients with tetraplegia.  the candidate will work with an interdisciplinary team including members from technical and clinical backgrounds. the team already has multiple emg and fes systems available, and the acquisition of new equipment is possible if needed. the candidate must also look forward to carry experimental work in the lab and in the clinical environment with real patients, always respecting the ethical aspects of the subject. ------------------- requirements background: engineering, automation, signal processing, instrumentation and/or robotics. excellent english communication skills (spoken and written) matlab programing/python signal processing, particularly biosignals. bonus skills: french communication skills experience with emg signals ------------------- benefits package     subsidized meals     partial reimbursement of public transport costs     leave: 7 weeks of

8891,2020,postdoctoral position in swarm robotics  for industry 4.0 at the university of southern denmark," the university of southern denmark invites applications from qualified doctoral graduates for a 3-year postdoctoral position in the fields of swarm robotics, artificial intelligence, and industry 4.0. the position is based in odense, denmark, and will be hosted by the sdu biorobotics unit of the maersk mc-kinney moller institute. the position is available starting 1. december 2020 or as soon as possible thereafter. -- focus of this position -- fine-grained central planning and control have so far been prevalent in large-scale manufacturing. the approach is, however, not well-suited for highly dynamic and unpredictable environments, where modern versatile collaborative robots (cobots) operate. to enable more flexible and collaborative manufacturing, robots must collectively become more autonomous. swarm robotics is an approach to the decentralized coordination of large multirobot systems. in this approach, there is a focus on embodiment, where robots communicate locally with one another, either explicitly or through modification of the environment. by following the core principles of individual autonomy, decentralized coordination, and self-organization, swarm robotics systems can achieve a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and robustness. the focus of the research is to bring the key advantages of swarm robotics to industry 4.0. we envision a future in which centralized planning is limited to high-level decision-making, and where robots use swarm robotics to coordinate and cooperate locally. the successful candidate will be involved in tackling the fundamental challenges associated with bringing this vision to fruition, which include basic research and experimental validation in perception, control, and decentralized coordination. experiments will be conducted in sdu?s state-of-the-art industry 4.0 lab, which is the largest of its kind in denmark and houses the newest robotics technology, storage cells, mobile robots, ar/vr technology, and digital twin technology. -- the research environment -- sdu biorobotics' current research program focusses, inter alia, on bio-inspired and biomimetic robotics, in which nature's exploitation of unconventional principles is of considerable interest. the unit works closely with sdu?s i4.0 lab, sdu's advanced manufacturing programs, and sdu?s unmanned aerial systems center. the environment in the unit is international and the daily language is english. -- profile and qualifications -- the ideal candidate for the position will have: * a phd degree or equivalent in a relevant discipline; * a strong research and publication record commensurate with career stage; * documented research experience in the areas of artificial intelligence, swarm robotics, or advanced manufacturing robots; * a commitment to basic science, but with experience with relevant experimental work; * documented teaching experience in relevant undergraduate and graduate programs. -- contact information -- further information is available from the professor mso anders lyhne christensen at email andc at mmmi.sdu.dk. -- conditions of employment -- employment as a postdoc requires scientific qualifications at phd level. employment as a postdoc is temporary and will cease without further notice at the end of the period. research will be predominant in the position. teaching assignments can be agreed individually. furthermore, other types of assignments may occur to a limited degree. the faculty determines the distribution of the various assignments. the weighting of the different assignments may vary over time. the successful applicant will be employed in accordance with the agreement between the ministry of finance and the danish confederation of professional associations. please check links for more information on salary and taxation: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/international_staff/on*arrival/salary/salary*rates__;kys!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdjfupg-9$  and https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/international_staff/on*arrival/taxation__;kw!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdaoxzjqm$  -- the assessment process -- read about the assessment and selection process: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/-/media/files/om_sdu/ledige_stillinger/ansoegere/tek/assessment_and_selection_process_faculty_of_engineering.pdf?la=en&hash=64f935f2851b68926cc0e3f9e59488c076bd9002__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdf32iwzm$  -- application procedure -- the faculty expects applicants to read how to apply before applying: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/servicenavigation/right/ledige_stillinger/jobs/soegjob__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdkft0u0s$  the application must be in english and must include: * motivated application * detailed curriculum vitae * certificates/diplomas (msc and phd) * list of publications indicating the publications attached * a maximum of 3 examples of the most relevant publications. * please attach one pdf-file for each publication reference letters and other relevant qualifications may also be included. the application deadline is ***august 16 2020*** the university wishes our staff to reflect the diversity of society and thus welcomes applications from all qualified candidates regardless of personal background. apply here: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sdu.dk/en/service/ledige_stillinger/1107972__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mddtrzmnh$  best regards, anders lyhne christensen professor mso sdu biorobotics mmmi, det tekniske fakultet t 65 50 73 24 m 93 50 75 10 andc at mmmi.sdu.dk syddansk universitet campusvej 55 5230 odense m https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.sdu.dk__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdes8hetn$ <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.sdu.dk/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdbfnhq1f$ > [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://cdn.sdu.dk/img/sdulogos/sdu_black_signatur.png__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8civuwqqqunk8n1mp335qoev6t0tlx8furnzfqngj-n0zbwlzyk5kvriqycl0a3mdocfrnz4$ ]"

(2086?) to 2867? (2304?) gross (net) per month depending on experience.  deadline for application : applications should be sent asap for selection in oct/nov 2020 and start in january 2021.  this postdoc is funded by an anr-dga astrid project aiming at exploiting natural human arm coordination to improve human-in-the-loop robotic arm control for prosthesis application. whereas most researches in prosthesis control focusses on myoelectric strategies based on residual muscle activities, a promising alternative aims at exploiting residual movements that are far more reliable and easier to interpret than muscle signals. our preliminary results in virtual reality (mick et al., submitted) proved the efficiency of this approach, which enables subjects to grasp bottles of various positions and orientations with performance comparable to that with their true arm, whereas multiple distal joints were controlled on the basis of shoulder movement and contextual knowledge about the movement goal (ie the object to grasp). this project builds upon this initial proof of concept to develop more complex and relevant tasks for amputees, and apply these to the control of an existing robotic arm platform (reachy, mick et al 2019, 2020). in addition to applying biomimetic control principles on the open source 3d printed robotic platform reachy, the overall project involves development of coadaptation strategies between the user and the applied artificial control (couraud et al., 2018), as well as links to contextual information extraction from gaze-assisted computer vision ( gonzalez-diaz et al 2019, p?rez de san roman et al., 2017 ).  keywords : robotic arm control, human movements, artificial neural network, ai/machine learning, motor control, biomechanics.  required knowledge and background :  - strong experience and achievements in (humanoid) robotics, and/or in the field of human-robot interaction  - experience in ai / machine learning and artificial neural networks  - good programing skills (python, c#, tensor flow, keras, ..)  other requirements:  -

invasive procedures (ref.bap-2020-821) *************************************** phd topic: recent efforts in robotics and automation research have fostered the development of a wide variety of bio-inspired snake-like continuum robots. miniature continuum robots can access confined spaces and, thanks to their compliance, follow complex trajectories exchanging limited forces with the surroundings. these properties explain the appeal of these robots in surgical applications and minimal invasive surgery in particular, where critical tasks are to be executed within the delicate and complex environment of the human body. compared to rigid robots, precise position and force control of these compliant robots is much more involved. it calls for an integrated approach combining accurate robot proprioception (self-awareness) with improved exteroception and 3d reconstruction of the robot's complex, deformable and often dynamic environment. by looking at new mechanisms for actuation, sensing and control, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and control over the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings. the conducted research will be applied on cardiovascular robotic catheter-based interventions and fetal surgical applications within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.     key words: novel actuation and sensing methods for catheters and flexible endoscopes, continuum robot control, 3d reconstruction, minimal invasive surgery, human-robot interaction. on the research group: the successful applicant

accurate robotic surgery (ref. bap-2020-806)  *************************************** phd topic: a key motivation for introducing robots in operating rooms has been their ability to deliver superhuman performance. surgical robots are able to execute highly precise gestures that rapidly and stably position instruments in many degrees of freedom (dofs). however, for the vast majority of surgical procedures, robotic positioning precision alone is not sufficient to realize the ""right gesture"". surgical plans are generally only a very idealised sketch of the intraoperative reality which is also defined by patient motion, tissue deformation, bleeding, and the like. therefore, when finally deciding where exactly to make ""the cut"" (or intervene on tissue in any other irreversible manner), surgeons ""disconnect"" from the preoperative plan. surgical teams resort to their own senses and experience. on the spot, based on the interpretation of the limited intraoperative scene, tactical decisions will be made. in this context, for orthopedic applications (e.g. pedicle screw placement), a rich set of sensors that could then form a comprehensive representative of surgical scenes can be utilized to offer the sufficient sensory information for autonomous robotic control. by looking at a wide range of smart sensors and signal processing and modelling algorithms, this phd will establish an improved understanding of and the robot's pose and contact state within its surroundings for orthopedic surgeries and formulate a consolidated strategy to fuse multi-modal sensory information and eventually design real-time control schemes. the conducted research will be applied on degenerative spine diseases for diagnosis and surgical interventions within an expanding research line at the department of mechanical engineering.     on the research group: the successful applicant will become part of the robot assisted surgery (ras) group

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies -

(the most  safety-critical situations) that need to be tested in the real-world,  and to carry out simulator-based tests with participants. thus, we will  guide the focus for, and maximise the benefits from, the expensive and  risky real-world testing to be carried out prior to implementing the  20-mile pilot driving route. to achieve this, you will utilise the  results of recent research, carried out in bristol, on simulation-based  verification and validation techniques for autonomous vehicles. you will  focus, in collaboration with the cav-forth partners, on a variety of  autonomy functions and use case scenarios. more details of required or desirable knowledge, expertise, skills, job  purpose and responsibilities for each of the two levels of appointment  can be found in the job descriptions associated with this advertisement. in addition to progressive pay rates, uwe bristol offers a wide range of  staff benefits including:  ??????? a generous holiday allowance  ??????? ? up to 12.5 bank holiday/closure days per year in addition  ??????? ? flexible working  ??????? ? excellent defined benefit pension schemes  ??????? ? option to participate in the cycle to work scheme  ??????? ? family friendly policies  ??????? ? on-site nursery at our frenchay campus. this post is based in the bristol robotics laboratory that is situated  at our lively frenchay campus where we have invested in the latest  facilities and resources to give our students access to everything they  need to succeed ? with ?300m having been spent recently on new  state-of-the-art learning spaces and accommodation to enhance our offer  even further. frenchay campus is within close proximity to excellent  motorway links and within walking distance of two train stations, making  uwe frenchay campus the ideal place to work for those wishing to commute  to bristol. further information: this is a full time, fixed term contract for 12 months and not available  on a job share basis, due to the tight interlinked nature of the  project?s goals and inter-partner schedule. if you would like an informal discussion, please contact prof. tony pipe  at: tony.pipe at brl.ac.uk. uwe is committed to supporting and promoting equality and diversity to  create an inclusive working environment. we believe this can be achieved  through attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse range of staff  from many different backgrounds who share our ambition to be a  university recognised for the success and impact of our  practice-oriented programmes; our strong industry networks and our  inclusive global outlook.  from 1 january 2021 we will be able to sponsor candidates for this role  under the home office tier 2 points based system (skilled worker route).  please read the attached guide at the full application link on the new  criteria to assess if you will be eligible to be sponsored under the  criteria. please also refer to the home office right to work checklist which  provides details of which documents are acceptable. should you be  shortlisted you will be asked to bring your right to work documents with  you to your interview so they can be copied and verified at that stage. the interviews are planned for early january 2021. --  ? tony pipe, professor of robotics and autonomous systems bristol robotics laboratory t-building university of the west of england frenchay campus bristol uk bs16 1qy tel: +44 (0)117 3286330"
