2810,2015,"two phd positions in visual-based  navigation and control for uavs at inria/irisa-cnrs, rennes, france"," the lagadic group at inria/irisa-cnrs rennes, france http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html has *two* open phd positions in the field of visual-based navigation and  control for uavs. **************      phd topics      ************** 1) visual predictive control for uavs -- description -- visual servoing is a well-known class of techniques meant to control the  pose of a robot from visual input by considering an error function  directly defined in the image (sensor) space. these techniques are  particularly appealing since they do not require, in general, a full  state reconstruction, they typically grant good robustness against  miscalibrations and model inaccuracies, and are computationally cheap  w.r.t. a full state estimation step. the goal of this phd scholarship is to investigate how to exploit the  visual servoing framework for effectively controlling the pose of a  quadrotor uav equipped with an onboard camera imu and embedded  processing power. the intended applications span precise positioning  over ground (moving) objects, trajectory following and formation  control. because of the quadrotor underactuation and inherent sensor  limitations (mainly limited camera fov), a special emphasis will be  placed on the use of model predictive control techniques (or similar  ideas) for explicitly dealing with this kind of constraints during flight. a full, sound (and onboard) implementation of all the developed schemes  on the quadrotor platforms available in the group will also be part of  the phd goals. -- candidate's expected profile -- the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of robotics, estimation and control. familiarity with quadrotor flight  control, visual-based control, predictive/optimal control, optimization,  image processing are a plus. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, engineering, applied mathematics (or  related fields) is required. ue or swiss nationality is also required  for applying to this position. -- salary -- full-time 3-year position paid according to french salary schemes. 2) robust visual state estimation and sensing for uavs -- description -- the goal of this phd position is to develop robust (and real-time)  computer vision algorithms for recovering the ""state"" of a quadrotor uav  from onboard sensing (mainly 2d/3d cameras and imu) and processing  power. here, the term ""state"" serves as a placeholder for, e.g.,  relative position w.r.t. other uavs in the scene, identity of  neighboring uavs, relative position w.r.t. surrounding obstacles,  velocity over ground, and so on. in summary, any relevant information  needed for controlling the quadrotor motion over ground, for avoiding  obstacles, and for keeping desired relative displacements with nearby  quadrotors (for the sake of formation control). the developed algorithms should possess a good degree of robustness  w.r.t. real-world conditions, for instance by avoiding, as much as  possible, the use of special markers or other artificial aids for  segmenting the environment or neighboring uavs. while the main  application will be indoor flight, extension to outdoor scenarios will  also be considered. -- candidate's expected profile -- the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of computer vision (for robotics applications), image processing and  pattern matching/classification. familiarity with the use of vision in  the context of quadrotor navigation/flight control (e.g., visual  odometry, visual slam) is a plus. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++, ros, and of the  relevant computer vision libraries (visp, opencv, pcl). scientific  curiosity, autonomy and ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, engineering (or related fields) is  required. no restriction on the candidate's nationality is present for  this position. -- salary -- full-time 3-year position paid according to french salary schemes. **************      environment

2811,2015,"postdoc and phd positions in  visual/force shared control architectures (romans eu h2020 project) at  inria/irisa-cnrs, rennes, france"," the lagadic group at inria/irisa rennes, france http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html has - *one* funded phd position (*phd1*, 3 years) and - *two* funded postdoc positions (*postdoc1* and *postdoc2*, 3 years) in the context of the new eu h2020 project *romans* (robotic  manipulation for nuclear sort and segregation). the romans project involves 5 top institutions across europe (uk, france  and germany), and its goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in mixed  autonomy for automatically sorting, segregating and cleaning up nuclear  waste by exploiting robotics arms equipped with onboard sensors (e.g.,  cameras) and under the partial guidance of a human operator. in particular, the following meta-tasks will be addressed withing romans: 1) developing novel hardware and software solutions for advanced  bilateral master-slave teleoperation 2) developing advanced autonomy methods for highly adaptive automatic  grasping and manipulation actions 3) combining autonomy and teleoperation methods using state-of-the-art  understanding of mixed initiative planning, variable autonomy and shared  control approaches 4) delivering a final demonstrator in an industrial plant-representative  environment -- description of the activities -- the lagadic group will contribute to the romans project by addressing  the following topics with the three offered positions (*phd1*,  *postdoc1* and *postdoc2*): - *postdoc1*: development of robust visual servoing and visual tracking  techniques for precisely positioning a robot arm over an object to be  grasped (also articulated or deformable) in presence of several  constraints (e.g., limited field of view, forbidden/dangerous zones for  the robot manipulator) and/or limited knowledge of the object 3d model  (by both exploring model-based and model-free servoing solutions).  exploitation of sensory redundancy for minimizing the effects of  occlusions or difficult tracking of the objects of interest. the  possible presence of a second robotic arm acting as ""supporting eye""  will be considered for improving the robustness of the system to  real-world conditions - *postdoc2*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being  executed. the goal is to suitably apply and extend the classical  force-feedback bilateral teleoperation framework to the particular tasks  addressed in the project (visual/sensor-based shared control of a  robotic arm approaching objects of interest to be grasped). the postdoc will be in charge of the scientific advancements in this  area by, e.g., investigating different combinations of force cues  displayed to the human operator (possibly varying with the particular  phase: free-motion, approaching, in contact, grasping, etc.), by  considering the possible use of ""local planners"" for quickly exploring  the future consequences of the operator's commands against the system  constraints (e.g., limited camera fov, joint limits, occlusions,  forbidden regions), and by participating to the design and  implementation of user evaluation studies for assessing the  performance/effectiveness of the proposed shared control architecture.  the postdoc will also directly supervise the phd student *phd1* - *phd1*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being executed. the phd student will be in charge of designing and implementing the  algorithmic component of the shared control architecture by, e.g.,  testing different possibilities for the displayed force cues (task  error, violation of constraints such as joint limits or loss of  tracking, presence of obstacles/forbidden regions, and so on), and by  running evaluation studies meant to assess the effectiveness of the  shared control architecture. the phd student will be under the direct  supervision of *postdoc2* and is expected to also work in close  collaboration with *postdoc1*. opportunities to actively collaborate with the several romans partners  will be highly encouraged. finally, the two postdocs are also expected to contribute to the project  management and related administrative tasks. -- candidates' expected profile -- -

2886,2015,postdoc position in cooperative  sensor-based control and localization for multi-robot systems," the lagadic group at inria/irisa rennes, france http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html has an *open postdoc position* in the field of *cooperative sensor-based  control and localization for multi-robot systems*. *********** description of the activities *********** multi-robot applications are attracting a steadily growing interest in  the robotics community based on the idea that proper coordination of  many simple robots can lead to the fulfillment of arbitrarily complex  tasks in a robust (to single robot failures) and highly flexible way.  teams of multiple robots can take advantage of their number to perform,  for example, complex manipulation and assembly tasks, or to obtain rich  spatial awareness by suitably distributing themselves in the  environment. autonomous search and rescue, firefighting, exploration and  intervention in dangerous or inaccessible areas are just some of the  most promising multi-robot applications. despite the various theoretical and technical advancements in the field,  however, the number of challenges that have to be overcome for actually  deploying a team of fully autonomous flying robots in an unstructured  environment is still large. for instance, nowadays most multi-robot  applications heavily exploit *highly structured/centralized facilities*  (e.g., indoor visual tracking systems, heavy use of gps-enabled  environments, presence of ground stations in charge of controlling the  whole mission and collecting all the data, and so on). these facilities  clearly help during the developing and testing phases, and can also be  suitable for specific scenarios (like tasks in well-defined indoor  factory floors). however, it is also clear that much more flexible  solutions should be devised for actually operating in *possibly  unstructured, unknown, ?un-prepared? environments* without the  possibility of resorting to ?external aids? besides the team own skills. the goal of this postdoc is to advance the state-of-the-art by  contributing to the conception, development and actual testing of novel  algorithms for allowing a group of multiple robots to autonomously  navigate in unknown, unstructured and cluttered environments by solely  resorting to their *""local skills""*, that is, *local onboard sensing*  (mainly vision) and *local communication*. quadrotor uavs equipped with  onboard cameras, imus and local communication capabilities will be the  target robotic platform for all algorithms. a rough list of possible  topics envisaged during the postdoc is as follows: - decentralized formation control from visual feedback  (*bearing-formation control*) for a group of quadrotor uavs - decentralized localization from visual feedback  (*bearing-localization*) for a group of quadrotor uavs - exploitation of graph theoretical tools (e.g., *connectivity* and  *bearing-rigidity*) for cooperatively estimating global quantities of  interest (e.g., common inertial reference frame, relative pose of the  agents in the group) - robustness against sensor limitations (e.g., limited camera fov,  occlusions) - robustness against delays, noise, packet losses and link failures - anonymity and correspondence-less cooperative control and estimation the initial postdoc duration is *12 months* but with the possibility of  extending it in case of mutual interest. *********** candidates' expected profile *********** the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in the field  of robotics, estimation and control with a focus on multi-robot  formation control and cooperative localization and, in general,  familiarity with the relevant multi-robot and multi-agent literature.  previous experience in visual-based control/estimation is a plus.  previous experience with quadrotor uavs is a plus but not strictly required. the candidate is expected to contribute mostly on the algorithmic side  (conception, analysis and design of cooperative formation  control/localization schemes from onboard measurements). however, an  implementation on the quadrotor platforms available in the group is also  welcome. co-supervision of the phd students involved in the project is  also welcome. the candidate should be knowledgeable about c/c++, ros and  matlab/simulink. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and ability to  work independently are also expected. a phd degree in computer science,  engineering, applied mathematics (or related fields) is required. *********** salary *********** full-time position paid according to french salary schemes. ***********  environment *********** the lagadic group, headed by francois chaumette, http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experiences in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision and sensor-based control for robotics  applications. the facilities available in the group include three 6-dof  manipulator arms, a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a state-of-the-art  human-size humanoid robot (romeo), a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an  indoor large testing arena instrumented with vicon. the candidates will be under the supervision of *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/paolo.robuffo_giordano.html and will work in close collaboration with other members of the lagadic  group involved in the project. the lagadic group is part of the inria/irisa lab that spreads its  activities in 30 research teams working in computer science, signal  processing, and control. it involves about 650 people, including 120  professors and assistant professors, 100 full-time researchers, 80  administrative staff, and 250 phd students. ***********  how to apply  *********** interested candidates must send to dr. paolo robuffo giordano (prg [at]  irisa.fr) the following material: - motivation letter - detailed cv - name of at least two referees - any relevant information for proving a good match with the postdoc  description and expected profile of the candidates the positions will remain open until a satisfactory candidate will be found. --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) lagadic team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/paolo.robuffo_giordano.html youtube: http://www.youtube.com/user/mpirobotics"

*postdoc2*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being  executed. the goal is to suitably apply and extend the classical  force-feedback bilateral teleoperation framework to the particular tasks  addressed in the project (visual/sensor-based shared control of a  robotic arm approaching objects of interest to be grasped). the postdoc will investigate different combinations of force cues  displayed to the human operator (possibly varying with the particular  phase: free-motion, approaching, in contact, grasping, etc.), by  considering the possible use of ""local planners"" for quickly exploring  the future consequences of the operator's commands against the system  constraints (e.g., limited camera fov, joint limits, occlusions,  forbidden regions), and by participating to the design and  implementation of user evaluation studies for assessing the  performance/effectiveness of the proposed shared control architecture. opportunities to actively collaborate with the several romans partners  will be highly encouraged. co-supervision of phd students involved in  the project is also possible -- candidates' expected profile -- -

name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 6. sensing humans: enhancing social abilities of the icub platform description: there is general consensus that robots in the future will work in close interaction with humans. this requires that robots are endowed with the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues and human intentions. such capabilities are fundamental prerequisites to program the robot to react appropriately to humans and to bias the interpretation of the scene using nonverbal cues (gaze or body gestures). the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social intentions. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot or his posture and intentions. conventional research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on applications in which the image patch of a whole person (or group of people) is visible without strong occlusions in. on the other hand, face-to-face interaction requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and alessio del bue (email: name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 7. spatial modeling of three-dimensional maps from stereo and rgbd sensors description: the ability to acquire high-resolution depth information allows for using three-dimensional geometries to build detailed shapes. the latter is fundamental for tasks that require complex interaction between the robot and the environment like balancing, walking or object grasping/manipulation. local shape information can in fact used to segment the scene and plan foot or hands placement to stabilize the robot or the fingers to achieve a stable grip of objects. this is a challenging task because it requires observations on both the geometry and the visual appearance of the surrounding surfaces, in relation to the body of the robot. to perform such tasks, features need to be extracted from the data allowing different regions to be compared and matched. depending on the complexity of the viewed scene, these features can be extracted from the depth data alone or need to be augmented with those extracted from images. the aim of this phd is to study the general problem of scene understanding by combining three-dimensional depth observations with visual appearance from images. the goal is to investigate novel features for local shape description and machine learning techniques for classification. we consider tasks like locomotion and object manipulation in scenarios that involve whole-body control. requirements: the ideal candidate would have a degree in computer science, engineering or related disciplines, with a background in computer vision and machine learning. he would also be highly motivated to work on robotic platform and have computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and tariq abuhashim (email: name.surname at iit.it) ******** * theme 8. event-driven human and action detection for the icub description: interacting with a dynamical environment is one of the major challenges of robotics. biology clearly outperforms robotic systems when acting in real scenarios in terms of appropriateness of the behavioural response, robustness to interference and noise, adaptation to ever changing environmental conditions, and energy efficiency. all these properties arise from the characteristics of the radically different style of sensing and computation used by the biological brain. in conventional robots, sensory information is available in a sequence of static snapshots and high dynamics can be sensed only by increasing the sampling rate. however the available bandwidth limits the amount of information that can be transmitted forcing a compromise between resolution and speed. event-driven vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. the proposed theme aims at the exploitation of highly dynamical and sparse information from event-driven sensors for fast detection of humans and action recognition. the automatic motion based segmentation performed by the event-driven cameras allows for fast detection of regions of interest. the research focus will be the exploitation of this segmentation for the detection and recognition of moving body parts to implement fast real-time human detection and action recognition. the ultimate goal is to improve awareness and interaction skills of the icub robot. requirements: degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. high motivation to work on a robotic platform and good programming skills. reference: benosman, r.; clercq, c.; lagorce, x.; sio-hoi ieng; bartolozzi, c.,

2907,2015,phd position - femto-st institute,"    phd position in microrobotics location: as2m dep, femto-st institute, france full description: handling objects smaller than 100?m remains a challenge that is of  utmost importance for several application fields, from electronics to  biology. microrobotics has developed contact based techniques using  tools usually inspired from their macrometer size counterparts, such as  grippers. however these tools are most of the time dedicated to objects  larger than 100?m. when smaller objects are considered non contact  actuation is commonly used. it is based on force fields produced by  remote sources. several actuation principles have been investigated,  among which magnetophoresis, acoustic waves, optical tweezers and  dielectrophoresis. these techniques differ by the nature of the objects  that can be handled (for example magnetophoresis can only be applied to  magnetic objects), the level of force that can be applied on the objects  and the technical constraints induced by the actuators (compactness of  the final prototype). to ensure long range displacements, in particular  for conveying of the parts before characterization or assembly, fluidic  flows inside microchips are often used. objectives the goal of this thesis is to perform active control based on  dielectrophoretic actuation. compared to state of the art systems this  work will implement closed loop control of the trajectory of the objects  inside the chips. enabling precise positioning control is a necessary  prerequisite to perform complex operations inside the chip in the  future, such as the mechanical characterization of the objects  (stiffness measurements for example) before sorting or the assembly of  different parts (figure 1). two key scientific and technological problematics will be addressed in  this project: (i) the trajectory and positioning control of the objects  and (ii) the integration of all the functions in a unique integrated  device. to be competitive compared to the current systems, two major  challenges should be addressed: (i) the system should not necessitate  any complex preliminary step to be used by (it should be plug and play)  and (ii) thousands of objects must be handled each second. it  necessitates high speed trajectory control. first proofs of concept have been demonstrated in the as2m department of  femto-st institute with high speed closed loop trajectory control of  artificial beads using dielectrophoresis actuation in a petri dish  (figure 2). dielectrophoresis consists in applying a non-uniform  electric field to dielectric objects. these objects will experience a  force either attractive or repulsive depending on the frequency of the  electric field and of characteristic constants of the objects and the  medium. electrodes are commonly deposited on a glass wafer to produce  the electric field. this technique can be used in combination with  microfluidic channels. this first step has shown the relevance of the  approach but several major changes must be made to adapt it to the  current system. the dielectrophoretic trajectory control should now be  included into microfluidic channels. in addition trajectory control is  usually based on visual feedback. however it requires a delicate  alignment between the camera and the chip, as well as adequate  lightening conditions. to avoid these cumbersome steps this thesis  proposes to use impedance spectrometry measurements to perform  trajectory control. impedance spectrometry consists in measuring the  variation of impedance due to the presence of an object between the  electrodes. description of the work this thesis will rely on the expertise of as2m department in femto-st  where the phd student will be located and the prof. p. renaud team in  epfl (switzerland) for the impedance spectrometry measurements. they  have recently shown proofs of concept of morphological measurements of  cells using this technique. similarly the impedance spectrometry  measurements also vary according to the position of the cell with  respect to the electrodes, and thus can be used as a position sensor.  tight collaborations with epfl (that is located 2 hours away from  besancon) are forecasted. several scientific challenges will be tackled: -    the modelling of the chip including both the fluidic aspects and  the dielectrophoretic ones used to move the objects. this model will be  used for: (i) the definition of design rules for the chips (including  the fluidic channels and the electrodes) and (ii) getting a model of the  system that will be inverted in real time to compute the input of the  system for closed loop control, -    the determination of control laws dedicated to the non linearities  of the dielectrophoretic field and to the low inertia of the objects  inducing large accelerations, -    the study of detection and tracking algorithms dedicated to  innovative position sensors (impedance spectroscopy measurements) which  guarantee the compactness of the chip. in particular the model giving  the position based on the impedance measurements will be studied , -    the realization of an experimental prototype (made in clean room  facilities). all the methodologies proposed during this thesis will be validated  experimentally. a prototype will be fabricated by the phd student  (assisted by the staff of the clean room of femto-st) and tests will be  performed on artificial beads. as a first proof of concept the final  prototype of this chip will be validated by a cell sorting operation. research institute femto-st institute is a joint research unit which is affiliated with the  french national centre of scientific research (cnrs), the university of  franche-comt? (ufc), the national school of mechanical engineering and  microtechnology (ensmm), and the belfort-montb?liard university of  technology (utbm). femto-st is active in different fields of engineering  science: computer science, mechanics, optics and telecommunications,  mechatronics, i.e. micro/nanorobotics and advanced control,  time-frequency, energetics and fluidics. femto-st hires around 700  persons, and is organized according to seven research departments. it  also runs a microfabrication technology centre, which is recognized  nation-wide, for mixing technologies from microelectronics and  micromechanics. the thesis will be done in the as2m department, automatic control &  micro-mechatronic systems. the research led in as2m department deals  with automatic control, robotics, mechatronics and industrial  engineering. this department has been working on microrobotics for more  than fifteen years, notably for micro/nanomanipulation and assembly,  development of components, systems and control methods to achieve tasks  at the microworld. with around 30 persons involved in microrobotics,  as2m is the biggest team in the world on microrobotics and is usually  involved in several european and national projects. the department has knowledge on non-contact manipulation and on high  speed trajectory control which will be exploited in this phd. the  candidate will get access to all the scientific equipment, including  finite element modeling software, micromanipulation platforms, clean  room facilities, etc. he/she will get the opportunity to present his/her  work in international conferences and journals. application the candidate should have a strong motivation for experimental work as  well as for team work. background in one of the following areas would be  appreciated: robotics, control, micromechatronics, microfabrication.  however, any application presenting a strong scientific background will  be considered. the candidate will work in a french laboratory, but the working language  will be either french or english according to the candidate skills. contacts: to apply, send a curriculum vita, a motivation letter and if available  the master grades to: michael.gauthier 'at' femto-st.fr aude.bolopion 'at' femto-st.fr before may, 12th 2015 --  aude bolopion as2m department - femto-st institute 24 rue alain savary, f-25000 besan?on, france +33 (0)3 81 40 29 25 -- view this message in context: http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/jobs-phd-position-femto-st-institute-tp5711333.html sent from the robotics-worldwide mailing list archive at nabble.com."

module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances

the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary

2910,2015,open phd thesis position in microbotics," phd thesis title:  manipulation and 3d robotized micro-assembly of nano-lamellas based nanophotonic structures in sem environment photonics_asssembly_phd_thesis.pdf <http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/file/n5711336/photonics_asssembly_phd_thesis.pdf>   context of the phd thesis: the proposed work falls within the general context of micro-assembly (assembly of components with dimensions generally smaller than 100 ?m) and will be applied to the realization of innovative nanophotonic functions and devices. many scientific and technological challenges remain in these fields where both as2m and optical departments of femto-st institute have world-class expertise. in the field of robotic micro-assembly, many results dealing with design, realization and control of different kinds of micromechatronic systems have been obtained. several micro-assembly platforms have also been developed. achieved studies enable to assemble components of few tens of micrometers in teleoperated or automated modes based on powerful vision or force feedback (fig. 1). micro-assembling face several specificities such as the predominance of surface forces over volume forces which induce complex behaviors (sticking like effects, difficulties to release accurately a component?), the very small free space (induces strong limitations in terms of actuators size, number of actuators or sensors in the area of interest), the use of actuators with highly non-linear behaviors, very bad signal to noise ratio?. in the field of nanophotonics, several theoretical works and related experimental validations improved a lot the understanding of physical effects induced by light transmission through metallic lamellas including sub-wavelength size holes. recent progresses of clean room microfabrication processes combined with these theoretical works conduct to innovative optical functionalities which directly open to the use of new optical phenomena at this scale (fig 1-d).      <http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/file/n5711336/phd.jpg>          fig1: (a) example of optical microsystem through robotic micro-assembly approach (b) micro-assembly platform comprising 9 degrees of freedom (dof), a smart microgripper, 3 high magnification cameras and a laser sensor (c) example of optical components being manipulated by a microgripper (size roughly 100 times bigger that the ones studied in the proposed phd thesis) (d-top) bragg grating with giant form factor obtained by ridge sidewall machining (d-bottom) lamella structured with studs. phd thesis objectives: manipulating and micro-assembly of lamellas on nanophotonic structures targets very promising and first order scientific challenges. it is notably required to define a gripping strategy, to develop adequate gripping tools (including force sensing) and to define a strategy for accurate assembly including bonding aspects all inside of a scanning electron microscope (sem).  the manipulation of such a lamella is a complex problem that thesis works has to be addressed. particular attention will be paid to the gripping tasks due to the high fragility of these components (form factor higher than 20), their very small size (largest dimension of few tens of micrometers order) and the need to ensure their position relative to the grippers frame very accurately. works will notably include the design of gripping tools and the definition of associated gripping strategies to ensure the high quality assembly despite many specificities due to the scale (difficulties to integrate sensors, actuators with non-linear behaviors, varying behaviors inducing varying models parameters, surface force influence?). once a lamella is gripped, its trajectory has to be accurately controlled during the whole assembly process to successfully place it on the optical structure with planar contact. this step is particularly critical because it notably requires controlling all the rotations of the lamella, error angles directly and strongly reducing the optical performances of the assembled photonic structure. to tackle this difficulty, the control of the robotic micro-assembly platform (including the microgripper with force sensing capabilities) may be done by using an active based feedback (using optical performances measurement of the photonic component during its assembly in real time). such an approach requires a multiphysic (mechanics-optics) model correlating the position of the lamella with the optical performances of the whole photonic structure. the phd student will manage the milestones including experimental validations that will be done in air environment at first. experiments will gradually converge towards the integration of main results to the vacuum environment of a sem. the final objective of the phd will be to achieve the structuration, assembly and bonding of a photonic structure through robotic micro-assembly approach inside a sem chamber. sem environment presents many interests but reversely brings strong constraints (very low volume, limitations in terms of materials to be used, specific experimentation protocols, specific physical behaviors). in terms of applications, several of them are already identified and have a promising industrial potential. these applications may be used as case study during the phd thesis (based on waveguides or multi-layered optical structures). due to these facts, patents may be expected in addition to high level journals that are targeted for scientific contributions. role of the phd student in the whole project: the phd student will be jointly advised by as2m (philippe lutz and c?dric cl?vy) and mn2s (nad?ge courjal) departments of femto-st institute and then will take benefits of the expertise of both teams in their respective fields. the phd student will then directly contribute to the collaboration between these departments. he/she will also take benefit from the ?-robotex  platform (which includes an innovative powerful sem equipped with fib, microrobotic tools inside of the chamber?) and from the expertise of research staff dedicated to this platform. the phd student may also use another nano-robotic platform working in air environment and will take part of the design step of photonic lamellas. reversely, progresses achieved by the phd student will bring new ideas, new scientific exchanges as well as in fields of robotics, optics and microscopy. advisory team of the phd:  c?dric cl?vy  (associate professor ? code team, as2m department , femto-st institute) philippe lutz (full professor and advisor of the phd? code team, as2m department, femto-st institute) nad?ge courjal (associate professor-hdr ? optics department, femto-st institute) requested skills: profiles based on/or merging competencies of mechatronics, robotics, automatic control and/or instrumentation will be considered with a great attention. the proposed thesis is for curious, inventive, dynamic appliquants having a strong scientific background and a sense of collaborative works. experience of research and experimentation will be appreciated extra points. funding: 3 years duration doctoral contract, the phd thesis beginning is expected in october 2015. application before may 20, 2015:

groups as well as the r&d of large enterprises (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-projects.html) and abroad research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen

2937,2015,phd positions available at the italian  institute of technology to work on the icub," dear roboticists, this is to advertise the following phd positions with scholarship at the icub facility, istituto italiano di tecnologia. the positions are available through the phd course of bioengineering and robotics, curriculum on advanced and humanoid robotics. successful applicants will join the icub facility department at the istituto italiano di tecnologia in genoa (http://www.iit.it/icub). for additional details please check: http://www.iit.it/en/openings/phd-calls.html ******** theme 1: articulatory information for automatic speech recognition in human-robot verbal interaction tutors: giorgio metta, leonardo badino description:  state-of-the art automatic speech recognition (asr) systems produce remarkable results in some scenarios but still lags behind human level performance in several real usage scenarios and perform poorly whenever the type of acoustic noise, the speaker's accent and speaking style are ""unknown"" to the system, i.e., are not sufficiently covered in the data used to train the asr system. the goal of the present theme is to create a robust speaker-independent key phrases recognition system where commands delivered by a user to a robot (i.e., the key phrases) have to be recognized in unconstrained utterances (i.e., utterances with hesitations, disfluencies, additional out-of-task words, etc.), in the challenging conditions of human-robot verbal interaction where speech is typically distant (to the robot) and noisy. to improve the robustness of the recognition system to intrinsically challenging and/or unknown conditions we will create recognition systems that combine acoustic features with predicted vocal tract articulatory movements (canevari et al. 2013) thus exploiting the articulatory representation of speech where phonetic targets (i.e., the articulatory targets necessary to produce a given sound) are largely invariant and complex phenomena observed in speech are can be compactly modeled. requirements:  the successful candidate will have a degree in computer science, bioengineering, physics or related disciplines. a background in speech and language processing is a plus. reference:  [1] canevari, c., badino, l., fadiga, l., metta, g., ""cross-corpus and cross-linguistic evaluation of a speaker-dependent dnn-hmm asr system using ema data"", interspeech workshop on speech production for automatic speech recognition, lyon, france, 2013. contacts: leonardo.badino at iit.it, giorgio.metta at iit.it ******** theme 2: whole-body real-time motion planning and control in compliant humanoids: theory and implementation on the icub tutors: francesco nori, giorgio metta, daniele pucci description:  the icub is among the few humanoids capable of whole-body motion control while being compliant to perturbations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrpbssqer3a). these capabilities are possible thanks to the icub peculiar sensors such as whole-body distributed tactile and force sensing. these sensors allow the icub to simultaneously control joint movements, joint torques and interaction forces. within this context, motion control is still an open research activity since previous approaches mainly dealt with kinematic movement planning. the icub instead needs a dynamic planner to simultaneously plan movements, torques and interaction forces. the goal of the proposed theme is to develop a kinematic and dynamic motion control software. given a control task, the foreseen controller will compute not only the kinematics (i.e. joint trajectories) but also the dynamics (i.e. joint torques and interaction forces) to perform the task. among the various solutions to the problem, optimal control will represent a primary focus of attention. specific tasks will include multi-contact motion planning [2], whole-body motion planning [3] and non-rigid contact motion planning. the project will be conducted within the context of a european project and the candidate will be asked to spend a six months experience in a foreigner country as a visiting ph.d. student. requirements:  candidate is requested to have a background in control theory, computer science and/or robotics. specific background in optimal control will be positively evaluated. special requirements: this theme is supported by an itn-h2020 research grant (secure). candidates should satisfy the eligibility criteria of the marie sk?odowska-curie actions. the position is suitable for candidates who have not have resided or carried out their main activity in italy for more than 12 months in the last 3 years preceding their recruitment. note: the position is associated with a considerably higher salary than a regular studentship and offers many opportunities to travel to the other european partners in the network. reference: [1] f nori, s traversaro, e jorhabib, f romano and d del prete a.;

2940,2015,"phd proposal: perception and rendering  of tissues stiffness in minimally invasive medical and surgical procedures,  in strasbourg/paris"," perception and rendering of tissues stiffness in minimally invasive medical and surgical procedures minimally invasive techniques have considerably modified surgery during the last three decades.  laparoscopic surgery, in particular, has been developing in many specialties, such as urology, digestive surgery, or gynecologic surgery. if they present numerous advantages for the patient (less scars, infection risks and a shorter recovery period), these surgical techniques have an influence on the surgeon perception. the natural perception of tissues properties resulting from palpation is no longer possible. the interactions are not direct and therefore less natural.  this induces difficulties to perform the gestures and limits the use of laparoscopic access to rather simple interventions. in endoscopic surgery, the introduction of rigid tools in the body comes with an artifact, the  fulcrum (or lever) effect. because of the rotation of the tools about a fixed point, the motions inside and outside the body are in opposite directions, which requires a particular training. also, the respective magnitude of the movements of the operator?s hand and of the surgical tool varies, depending on the tool insertion depth . finally, the lever effect also modifies the forces, which leads to a distorted perception of stiffness. if li denotes the length of the tool within the body, and lo the length of the tool outside the body, it can be easily shown that the stiffness perceived at the tool is the real stiffness multiplied by (li/lo)^2.  this naturally provides misleading feedback, and this is even amplified when the distal motions are observed on a screen, with and endoscope, whose amplification is fixed and does not depend on the lever.  to assist medical interventions, robotic means are proposed in the literature, where two main approaches exist (cf. figure 1): ?	telemanipulation, which assumes that a slave arm manipulates the instrument, tracking the motions imposed by the surgeon on a master arm. this approach has proved successful because of its clinical development, but force feedback is not allowed by present commercial systems, used in the operating room. as a result, the available systems cannot solve the problems of stiffness perception; ?	collaborative manipulation (or comanipulation), a paradigm for which the surgeon and the robot jointly manipulate the tool, which allows the robot to apply forces to guide the surgeon. the interest of this approach lies in its simplicity and modularity. however, the choice of the robot impedance in order to take the lever effect into account remains an open problem.    <http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/file/n5711406/chir1.png>  <http://robotics-worldwide.1046236.n5.nabble.com/file/n5711406/chir2.png>           figure 1: two approaches for the assistance to surgical gestures in laparoscopic surgery  (left: telemanipulation; right: comanipulation) in this thesis, we will compare two possible approaches:  ?	an approach for which the tool is manipulated through a variable stiffness device, allowing to correct the fulcrum effect (comanipulation) ; ?	an approach for which the manipulated tool has a constant stiffness, but is teleoperated in a way that the force feedback may restore the actual stiffness to the operator, removing the distortion due to the fulcrum effect. the study will explore the mechatronic design of variable stiffness systems, the control aspects, but also the sensorimotor behavior of the operator. it will consist, in particular to understand, if the operator can move the distal point of the instrument, in the same manner as it is performed in conventional open surgery. a possibility will be to use the analysis of gestures kinematics and stiffness perception. the influence of training (comparison between expert surgeons and beginers) will be a particular problem of interest. environment this work is collaboration between  icube laboratory, in strasbourg, and isir laboratory in paris, within the frame of the computer assisted medical interventions excellence laboratory (cami labex). it takes place in the continuation of research led in strasbourg on telemanipulation and variable stiffness robots, and in paris on collaborative manipulation. the thesis will mostly take place in strasbourg, but a significant stay in paris will be considered. profile the candidate will ideally have a multidisciplinary profile with skills in control/robotics but also in mechatronic design. less polyvalent profiles, with a strong skill will however be considered. a real interest for experimentation is required.

research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations  (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1)development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel  robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on  automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of  manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low  volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to  quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive  to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots,  sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is  very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software  framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal  of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software  based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive,  easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means  the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost  every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile  also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the  developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the  experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from  the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since  it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the  virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body  and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit  these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable  for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali

caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the  flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the  results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances.  the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the  flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is  still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is  affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the  settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the  potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power  for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the  elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these  results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders  as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic  link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project)  improving the design part which takes in account the structure  behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control  to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between  robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial  applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd

established itself among top research institutes worldwide. iit has a strong international character, with more than 40% foreign scientific staff drawn from over 50 countries worldwide. the successful applicants will join the robot learning and interaction lab of iit, department of advanced robotics: http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/learning-and-interaction the applicants can choose from the following four themes: 26, 27, 28 and 29 as described below. further information is available at: http://kormushev.com/news/phd-positions-in-robotics-and-machine-learning-for-2016/ ----------------------------------------------------- theme 26. robotic surgery with improved safety using machine learning for intelligent robot tele-operation and partial autonomy tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: flexible hyper-redundant systems are becoming of increasing interest in medical applications where the flexibility of the robot can be used to direct the surgery around delicate tissues, however, these system are highly non-linear with complex dynamic making them very difficult to control. this project will develop and implement machine learning algorithms to improve the intelligence of control and perception in flexible devices and enhance safety. the advantages of using machine learning will be investigated in multiple potential areas, as follows: in low-level robot control using model learning approaches; in feedback control considering multi-modal input from position, force and pressure sensors; in tele-operation using learning of context-dependent skills for assisting the human operators (surgeons). the work will also investigate the possibility of using partial autonomy at a lower control level using reactive strategies for robot control. with respect to safety the project will consider how to use the development of learning algorithms to automatically detect abnormalities during robot teleoperation. these abnormalities may include excessive forces/pressure, excessive bending, unusual signals potentially indicating problems during the medical procedure. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 27. novel robot control paradigms enabled by machine learning for intelligent control of the next generation compliant and soft robots tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: despite the significant mechatronic advances in robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts. motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus on machine learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning of motor skills. the type of motor skills that will be investigated include object manipulation, compliant interaction with objects, humans and the environment, force control and vision as part of the robot learning architecture. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant robot control. ideas from developmental robotics will be considered, in search for a qualitatively better approach for controlling robots, different than the currently predominant approach based on manually-engineered controllers. the work within this phd theme will include developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn new skills. at the same time, the methods should allow for natural and safe interaction with people. to this end, the research will include learning by imitation and reinforcement learning, as well as human-robot interaction. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 28. agile robot locomotion using machine learning for intelligent control of advanced humanoid robots tutors: dr. petar kormushev, dr. nikos tsagarakis description: the state-of-the-art high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offer a significant potential for achieving more agile robot locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion. the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, coping with multiple contacts with the environments, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child. ----------------------------------------------------- theme 29. dexterous robotic manipulation using machine learning for intelligent robot control and perception tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell description: this project will investigate collaborative human-robot task learning and execution that uses the available perception (particularly tactile). the work will develop algorithms for learning of collaborative skills by direct interaction between a non-expert user and a robot. the tasks will build the necessary control algorithms to allow effortless and safe physical human-robot interaction using the available tactile feedback. the final objectives will include: acquiring the perceptual information needed for robot to co-manipulate an object with human, understanding human's state in an interaction task so as to react properly, building a framework for online compliant human-robot interaction based on real-time feedback of the state of the object and human. the project will also consider semi-supervised and unsupervised skill learning approaches. it will develop tactile-guided autonomous learning algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods for reinforcement learning and deep learning. the tactile feedback will help to increase the performance of skill execution autonomously by the robot through trial-anderror interactions with the objects in the environment. in addition this work will focus on supervised skill learning approaches. it will develop tactile-guided learning algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods for learning by imitation and visuospatial skill learning. the tactile perception information will be used both in the learning phase and the execution phase, to improve the robustness and the range of motor skill repertoire. ----------------------------------------------------- requirements: background in computer science, mathematics, engineering, physics or related disciplines. how to apply: to apply please

the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer science, 20% mechanism reference: fei chen, ferdinando cannella, carlo canali, traveler hauptman, giuseppe sofia, darwin g. caldwell, ''in-hand precise twisting and positioning by a novel dexterous

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen

groups as well as the r&d of large enterprises (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-projects.html) and abroad research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1) development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots, sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive, easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science. the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer science, 20% mechanism reference: fei chen, ferdinando cannella, carlo canali, traveler hauptman, giuseppe sofia, darwin g. caldwell, ''in-hand precise twisting and positioning by a novel dexterous

manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances. the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project) improving the design part which takes in account the structure behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and control, and the development of novel robotic components and technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen

research centres thanks to the projects and collaborations  (http://www.iit.it/it/aia-research.html). the phd call details of the two themes are in the following: 1)development of reconfigurable and module robotic software for novel  robotic manipulator tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. darwin caldwell description: nowadays the manufacturing is facing an urgent demand on  automation upgrade to meet the requirements from various types of  manufacturing industry. however, the current robotic man manufacturing system is still not flexible and adaptive to high mix low  volume manufacturing. one of the challenges is to study and solve how to  quickly deploy the robotic software and hardware suitable and adaptive  to robotic manufacturing changes, which may include multiple robots,  sensors (vision, force) and related machines. as a consequence, it is  very important to design novel module and reconfigurable software  framework to manage multiple types of robots and robotic systems. goal  of this phd is to study, design and build novel industry-level software  based on ros or ros-industry which is modular, reconfigurable, adaptive,  easy to use to integrate and control various robotic systems. it means  the system should be able to detect, communicate and control almost  every current existed robotic systems or communication styles. meanwhile  also build a reconfigurable robotic manipulator so as to test the  developed software. the manipulator design will be based on the  experience obtained from previous projects, but also is inspired from  the nature of human beings hands or other similar bio-mechanisms. since  it is very complicated to design a bio-inspired robotic mechanism, the  virtual prototyping development (co-simulation that involves multi-body  and finite element and control) is required as a basic skill. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics. thus the industrial developments exploit  these advances that permit to design the humanoid-like robots suitable  for the industrial plants. this work will be under supervision of dr. fei chen, dr. carlo canali requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong  interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in computer science.  the background must be in robotics. the ideal competencies should be in  computer science with strong programing skill, especially program using  c++ under linux. required technical skills: 80% computer science, 20%  mechanism reference: fei chen, ferdinando

caldwell description: currently the compliance of the robots is given by the  flexible joint and the precision is guaranteed by the rigid link. the  results is an heavy robot with high accuracy but low speed performances.  the using of elastic link to reduce the weight and to extend the  flexibility from the joints to whole robot is a non-new idea, but it is  still an open challenge for many issues: the precise position control is  affected by the deflection, long lasting oscillations prolong the  settling time, and so on. solving these problems means to improve the  potentiality of the robots: e.g. reducing the weight and then the power  for moving them (that means more autonomy and higher performances), the  elastic deformation can be stored and realised to harvest energy, these  results can be applied to similar design (fire-rescue turntable ladders  as well as cherry pickers, etc.). so the goal of this phd is to design and build novel robot with elastic  link, to go further the current state of art (e.g. tudor project)  improving the design part which takes in account the structure  behaviour. then this behaviour will be implemented in the force control  to exploit the link elasticity for the compliance interaction between  robot and environment, i.e. impulsive interaction with environment. moreover the research is carried out within the advr that concentrates  on an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to humanoid design and  control, and the development of novel robotic components and  technologies. this encompasses activities from both the hard and soft  systems areas of robotics that are suitable also for industrial  applications. this work will be under supervision of dr. carlo canali, dr. fei chen requirements: this position is open to a phd

*postdoc1*: development of robust visual servoing and visual tracking  techniques for precisely positioning a robot arm over an object to be  grasped (also articulated or deformable) in presence of several  constraints (e.g., limited field of view, forbidden/dangerous zones for  the robot manipulator) and/or limited knowledge of the object 3d model  (by both exploring model-based and model-free servoing solutions).  exploitation of sensory redundancy for minimizing the effects of  occlusions or difficult tracking of the objects of interest. the  possible presence of a second robotic arm acting as ""supporting eye""  will be considered for improving the robustness of the system to  real-world conditions. integration of the developed visual control  algorithms in a higher-level shared control architecture (coordinating  with postdoc2) - *postdoc2*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being  executed. the goal is to suitably apply and extend the classical  force-feedback bilateral teleoperation framework to the particular tasks  addressed in the project (visual/sensor-based shared control of a  robotic arm approaching objects of interest to be grasped). the postdoc will investigate different combinations of force cues  displayed to the human operator (possibly varying with the particular  phase: free-motion, approaching, in contact, grasping, etc.), by  considering the possible use of ""local planners"" for quickly exploring  the future consequences of the operator's commands against the system  constraints (e.g., limited camera fov, joint limits, occlusions,  forbidden regions), and by participating to the design and  implementation of user evaluation studies for assessing the  performance/effectiveness of the proposed shared control architecture. opportunities to actively collaborate with the several romans partners  will be highly encouraged. co-supervision of phd students involved in  the project is also possible -- candidates' expected profile -- -

surgical robotic applications    description of the institution    the department of computer science of the university of  verona is looking for a highly motivated   candidate to apply for a marie sklodowska-curie individual  fellowship in the altair robotics   laboratory. the department of computer science of the  university of verona (italy) was funded in   2001 and is located in the south of verona. its main  research labs and offices are located in the   area of the medical-scientific centre of the university. the  department has several research and   teaching activities that represent a continuous of  competences from mathematics, through computer   science and computer engineering, up to physics. active  research areas are: discrete and application   mathematics, theory of computation, machine intelligence,  information systems, software engineering   and security, applied computing, cyber-physical systems,  applied and experimental condensed matter   physics. finally, the leadership of the department in  applied research and the impact on the   surrounding area are confirmed by research funding via  european, national and regional programs and   by the seven spin-offs created in the last years.  the altair robotics laboratory was founded in 2000,  concurrently with the establishment of the   courses automatic controls and robotics within the  department of computer science of the university   of verona. the main fields of exploration in the research  group range from surgical and medical   robotics, smart robotic instruments, images analysis,  virtual and augmented reality to mobile   robotics and uavs.    description of the position    the robotic group of the department of computer science  looks for an experienced researcher   (post-doc) with competences in robotics, control systems,  software development and bioinformatics,   to develop and extend projects in the field of smart  instrument design for surgical robots. the   robotics group aims at reinforcing their knowledge in this  field, by this opportunity. the post-doc   will find an environment of researchers at all levels with  whom he/she can collaborate to implement   the project.  reusability and modularity are key factors in design and  manufacturing of the next generation of   surgical instruments: smart surgical instruments.  instruments that are engineered based on   patient-specific pre-operative data designed to follow  specific access routes that cause minimal or   zero trauma, that are inherently compliant by nature and  embed distributed sensing in support of   cognitive behaviour e.g. allowing local autonomy. modularity  in design and manufacturing will be   essential to permit cost efficient design, composition and  deployment of these instruments.  moreover, the design and use of such smart instruments  improves the dexterity and increases the   precision of the intervention. this is due to their  patient-specific design but also to the   possibility of using different diagnosis tools, since  instruments embed sensors or can be designed   with different materials.  the design of smart surgical instruments is also connected  with the 3d printing techniques, image   analysis and sensor fusion methods and distributed control  theories.  the selected candidate will be invited to submit a msca if  proposal together with prof. fiorini,   supervisor of the proposal. the involvement of the selected  candidate in the proposal writing   process will provide ample opportunity to tailor the  proposal to his / her research

3060,2015,two fellowship positions on haptics and  vision for teleoperated mobile manipulation on eu euroc project at italian  institute of technology (iit)," the department of advanced robotics at the istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit), an english-language research institute in genoa, italy, is looking for two highly motivated full-time fellows with key research roles in the area of mobile manipulation. the selected applicants will join the advanced industrial automation laboratory and have the opportunity to pursue research within the fp7 european robotic challenge (euroc) project funded by the european commission under contract no. 608849. the project will involve collaboration with a consortium of leading universities and research institutes in europe and will last until december 2017. the main objectives of this project are to drive innovation in european robotics and manufacturing, and to strengthen collaboration and cross-fertilisation between the industrial and the research communities. towards this aim euroc has launches and will run three industrially relevant challenges in european robotics with applicability to the factory of the future (c1: reconfigurable interactive manufacturing cell; c2: shop floor logistics and manipulation; c3: plant servicing and inspection). these challenges cover the most promising application scenarios, and thus, product visions, of the european robotics industry (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=euroc_project). the ""automap"" project, led by iit, is a collaboration with cern (european organization for nuclear research) within challenge c2 - shop floor logistics and manipulation and is aimed at building a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system. this challenge is based on use case operations to be carried out on cern's flagship accelerator, the large hadron collider (lhc), which is the most powerful accelerator in the world and has been in operation since 2010. the main motivation for carrying out maintenance work using a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system is to reduce maintenance personnel exposure to hazards in the lhc tunnels - such as ionizing radiation and oxygen deficiency hazards. a second motivation is that the robot will be able to autonomously carry out the same tasks in the assembly facility as in the tunnel on collimators during their initial build and quality assurance. this robotic mobile manipulation system should be easily reconfigured by non-specialist personnel to perform autonomous/semi-autonomous tasks in the unstructured environment (autonomous navigation and identification of various types of collimators). implementing a high performance teleoperation capability will also be necessary for work in the lhc tunnel to allow safe teaching and learning by teleoperation demonstration and to allow recovery without damaging delicate accelerator equipment in the event of unforeseen problems (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=automap). we are looking for two highly motivated young scientists with a background in robotics and/or mechanics/control/electronics/computer science engineering to be responsible for the following two jobs respectively: job1 -

3083,2015,two fellowship positions on haptics and  vision for teleoperated mobile manipulation on eu euroc project at italian  institute of technology (iit)," (apologies for multiple copies due to cross-posting) the department of advanced robotics at the istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit), an english-language research institute in genoa, italy, is looking for two highly motivated full-time fellows with key research roles in the area of mobile manipulation. the selected applicants will join the advanced industrial automation laboratory and have the opportunity to pursue research within the fp7 european robotic challenge (euroc) project funded by the european commission under contract no. 608849. the project will involve collaboration with a consortium of leading universities and research institutes in europe and will last until december 2017. the main objectives of this project are to drive innovation in european robotics and manufacturing, and to strengthen collaboration and cross-fertilisation between the industrial and the research communities. towards this aim euroc has launches and will run three industrially relevant challenges in european robotics with applicability to the factory of the future (c1: reconfigurable interactive manufacturing cell; c2: shop floor logistics and manipulation; c3: plant servicing and inspection). these challenges cover the most promising application scenarios, and thus, product visions, of the european robotics industry (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=euroc_project). the ""automap"" project, led by iit, is a collaboration with cern (european organization for nuclear research) within challenge c2 - shop floor logistics and manipulation and is aimed at building a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system. this challenge is based on use case operations to be carried out on cern's flagship accelerator, the large hadron collider (lhc), which is the most powerful accelerator in the world and has been in operation since 2010. the main motivation for carrying out maintenance work using a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system is to reduce maintenance personnel exposure to hazards in the lhc tunnels - such as ionizing radiation and oxygen deficiency hazards. a second motivation is that the robot will be able to autonomously carry out the same tasks in the assembly facility as in the tunnel on collimators during their initial build and quality assurance. this robotic mobile manipulation system should be easily reconfigured by non-specialist personnel to perform autonomous/semi-autonomous tasks in the unstructured environment (autonomous navigation and identification of various types of collimators). implementing a high performance teleoperation capability will also be necessary for work in the lhc tunnel to allow safe teaching and learning by teleoperation demonstration and to allow recovery without damaging delicate accelerator equipment in the event of unforeseen problems (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=automap). we are looking for two highly motivated young scientists with a background in robotics and/or mechanics/control/electronics/computer science engineering to be responsible for the following two jobs respectively: job1 -

shop floor logistics and manipulation and is aimed at building a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system. this challenge is based on use case operations to be carried out on cern's flagship accelerator, the large hadron collider (lhc), which is the most powerful accelerator in the world and has been in operation since 2010. the main motivation for carrying out maintenance work using a remotely controlled mobile manipulation system is to reduce maintenance personnel exposure to hazards in the lhc tunnels - such as ionizing radiation and oxygen deficiency hazards. a second motivation is that the robot will be able to autonomously carry out the same tasks in the assembly facility as in the tunnel on collimators during their initial build and quality assurance. this robotic mobile manipulation system should be easily reconfigured by non-specialist personnel to perform autonomous/semi-autonomous tasks in the unstructured environment (autonomous navigation and identification of various types of collimators). implementing a high performance teleoperation capability will also be necessary for work in the lhc tunnel to allow safe teaching and learning by teleoperation demonstration and to allow recovery without damaging delicate accelerator equipment in the event of unforeseen problems (for detail: http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=automap). we are looking for two highly motivated young scientists with a background in robotics and/or mechanics/control/electronics/computer science engineering to be responsible for the following two jobs respectively: job1 -

point of the  trajectory is a key element, which allow to give priority to the  temporal definition of the trajectory, or alternatively to the tracking  accuracy of the associated path. similarly, the temporal evolution along  the trajectory at the controller level can be parameterized to accept a  delay or not. for example, following to an unforeseen event that  generate a delay along the trajectory, the robot can choose to trigger  an error, to continue with a delay or to continue compensating the  delay. these functionalities are presented here for the movement; one  aspect of the proposed work consists in the extension of these concepts  to temporal functions describing forces and stiffnesses. it would be interesting to realize numerous interactive manipulation  tasks, both for service and industrial cooperative robotic. a study  carried out among quadriplegic people as part of the anr-assist  <http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?projet=anr-07-robo-0011>  project showed that these persons are very interested in recovering  their privacy. help with dressing, for example, cannot be described only  in terms of motions. it is necessary to precise acceptable stiffness,  position and force limits. we had to deal with the same kinds of  problems for an industrial collaborative assembly. the description of  the interactive motions to define the controller includes not only the  trajectory, but also stiffness and force evolution. the aim of this work is to define temporal models for interactive  manipulation tasks and then to show that planners and controllers based  on these models offer interesting possibilities. these models should  also help to improve communication between different robot modules, for  example a planner and a controller. experiments and validations will be carried out with the robots of the  laas robots platform <https://www.laas.fr/public/en/robots-platform>,  such as two pr2 from willow garage and jido equipped with two lwr-4 kuka  arms. the team is also involved in different research project related to  robot interaction (saphari <http://www.saphari.eu/>, spencer  <http://spencer.eu/>, mardi). to apply, please send your cover letter and cv to: daniel.sidobre at laas.fr looking forward to your applications.      daniel. -- daniel sidobre   ma?tre de conf?rences ?

*postdoc1*: development of robust visual servoing and visual tracking  techniques for precisely positioning a robot arm over an object to be  grasped (also articulated or deformable) in presence of several  constraints (e.g., limited field of view, forbidden/dangerous zones for  the robot manipulator) and/or limited knowledge of the object 3d model  (by both exploring model-based and model-free servoing solutions).  exploitation of sensory redundancy for minimizing the effects of  occlusions or difficult tracking of the objects of interest. the  possible presence of a second robotic arm acting as ""supporting eye""  will be considered for improving the robustness of the system to  real-world conditions. integration of the developed visual control  algorithms in a higher-level shared control architecture (coordinating  with postdoc2) - *postdoc2*: algorithms for shared control architectures for allowing a  human operator to partially control the robot motion by providing a  force/visual feedback informative of how well the task is being  executed. the goal is to suitably apply and extend the classical  force-feedback bilateral teleoperation framework to the particular tasks  addressed in the project (visual/sensor-based shared control of a  robotic arm approaching objects of interest to be grasped). the postdoc will investigate different combinations of force cues  displayed to the human operator (possibly varying with the particular  phase: free-motion, approaching, in contact, grasping, etc.), by  considering the possible use of ""local planners"" for quickly exploring  the future consequences of the operator's commands against the system  constraints (e.g., limited camera fov, joint limits, occlusions,  forbidden regions), and by participating to the design and  implementation of user evaluation studies for assessing the  performance/effectiveness of the proposed shared control architecture. opportunities to actively collaborate with the several romans partners  will be highly encouraged. co-supervision of phd students involved in  the project is also possible -- candidates' expected profile -- -

3240,2015,"phd research fellowship: ""a multi-agent  architecture framework dedicated to energy systems"" by cea (paris, france)"," title: a multi-agent architecture framework dedicated to energy systems keywords: multi-agent systems, energy systems, architecture framework, smart grid context the cea is the french alternative energies and atomic energy commission. leader in research, development and innovation with its 16000 employees, cea is active in four main areas: low-carbon energies, defense and security, information technologies and health technologies. the cea-list institute (http://www-list.cea.fr/en) invites applications for a phd scholarship in the area of multi-agent systems and software architecture for the energy domain. the successful candidate will join a research team in multi-agent systems at ladis (data analysis and intelligent systems lab) and lise (laboratory for model-based engineering of real-time and embedded (rt/e) systems) at cea saclay campus (paris area). this research thread, while still quite recent, is already very active and well integrated in the related european research area. thanks to the various outstanding academic partnerships we have developed, the coming years are very promising, with several national and european collaborative projects. these students are enrolled in a doctoral program under a three-year contract. research in the recent years, multi-agent systems (mas) have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for the design and development of energy systems [1,2,3]. agent-based solutions tackle complex energy systems by enabling the implementation of autonomous control entities embedded in dynamic and distributed environments that are able to coordinate in a cooperative and fault-tolerant manner. however, this interrelation between mas and energy systems still has many challenges. on one hand, the mas designer is confronted to multiple technical and methodological issues when devising a system, due to the large range of available design methodologies (gaia, mase, adelfe, prometheus, ingenias, etc.), and the different agent anatomies (bdi, layered anatomies, reactive agents, etc.). further than the variety of approaches to implement, there also exist a plethora of tools for the implementation of multi-agent systems (2apl , chape , jade , jack , volttron , etc.) where some are using general purpose programming languages (i.e. java and c++), while the others are using domain specific languages (i.e. 2apl).  model-driven engineering techniques can improve the design and implementation of such developed systems in terms of productivity, portability, inter-operability and maintenance [4]. on the other hand, energy systems are complex systems of systems, serving the diverse needs of many stakeholders and in which standards play a fundamental role. to address these challenges european standards organizations recently proposed the smart grid architecture model (sgam) [5]. this model can be used for visualization, validation and configuration of smart grid projects, and also for standardization within smart grids. thus, we highlight that while there exists in the literature separate architectures models for mas and energy systems, to the best of our knowledge an architecture model that supports mas in energy systems has not been proposed. this phd thesis aims to fill this gap by proposing an architectural framework for mas dedicated to energy systems to help the uptake of this technology within the power industry. by architecture framework we mean the set of conventions, principles and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of application and/or community of stakeholders [5]. such a dedicated architectural framework shall: ?                    integrate viewpoints dealing with mas requirements, and cover all aspects of multi-agent systems, including agent models, interaction, communication (i.e. fipa mas standards ), and organization paradigms. ?                    support viewpoints defined in the sgam (smart grid architectural model) standard [5] as well as data types and components libraries conforming to energy standards (iec 61970, iec 61968, iec 2325, fsgim, etc.). ?                    support multiple approaches and processes for the design of mas dedicated to energy systems. those processes will define architectural design rules and the set of activities needed to design a mas architecture. please note that the scope of this thesis will go beyond the mere abstract theoretical framework, i.e., the successful candidate is expected to develop integrated tool set where it is possible to devise mas applications, from modelling to deployment, as described in the proposed architectural framework. this tool set will basically offer the following: ?                    a graphical modelling tool that allows specification of mas designs by means of a graphical editor (e.g., papyrus  [6]), ?                    functionalities of automatically generating deployment plans from the specification and generation of code from these plans to deploy mas designs into several target mas implementation frameworks. to show the implications of the study, several energy domain mas case studies will be developed by using the dedicated tool set. requirements the ideal candidate holds a university degree in computer science or computer engineering that can be accepted by the partner universities for registration as a phd student. independent working skills are valued as well as the capability of working in a team. collegiality and interpersonal skills are essential. very good english language skills are highly desired. application to apply, please submit by email a curriculum vitae (cv), a letter of motivation and contact information for two references to dr. hassan sleiman (hassan.sleiman at cea.fr) and dr. ?nder g?rcan (onder.gurcan at cea.fr). we will review your application and contact with you for further questions and information. to apply for this vacancy, please ensure you meet all eligibility and entrance requirements as phd student. references [1] s. d. j. mcarthur; e. m. davidson; v. m. catterson; a. l. dimeas; n. d. hatziargyriou; f. ponci; t. funabashi, ?multi-agent systems for power engineering applications ?

3241,2015,open phd position - 3d mapping and  localization of fast vehicles," open phd thesis position: 3d mapping and localization of fast vehicles with non-global   acquisition cameras (rolling shutter, dynamic roi) context dense 3d reconstruction of extremely fast moving objects could   contribute to various applications such as 3d scene interpretation and   accident avoidance, body structure analysis and so on. many consumer   cameras sold today are equipped with cmos sensors with rolling   shutter. these cameras are renowned for being both low cost, low power   and fast. these qualities are especially popular for embedded   applications. however, sequential exposure of the pixels in these   cameras causes geometric distortions in the image when either the   camera or the scene moves, making classical structure from motion   algorithms less accurate or even inadequate. recently, 3d   reconstruction methods taking into account these distortions have been   proposed. some approaches require continuity and ""smoothing"" of the   movement during the shooting but also between the views thus imposing   an acquisition at very high frequency. other approaches consider   specific movements such as pure translation for example. objectives the work in this thesis concerns simultaneous 3d reconstruction and   localization using fast cmos cameras, with non global shutter   acquisition mode such as rolling shutter or dynamically reconfigurable   rois (region of interest), embedded on a vehicle or an uav. we aim to   develop a technique based on the smallest amount of data (ideally a   one-shot method) that reconstructs instantaneous 3d shape and motion.   this will allow a location at high speed without latency. moreover,   motion estimate will introduce a prediction model to be used for   feature tracking algorithms in order to effectively boost the matching   of features between images. the first objective is to propose methods such as bundle adjustment   which take into account the effect of the rolling shutter or   sequential roi acquisition, and which operate under the same shooting   conditions than conventional methods (that is to say with a sequence   of images taken at more or less remote poses). one possible solution   consists in taking into account the vehicle evolution model (for   example non-holonomy constraint) in order to compensate the loss of   rigidity of the scene assumed in all classical structure from motion   techniques. a second challenging task is to adapt the methods of feature matching   between the images to make the reconstruction as dense as possible.   indeed, existing methods consider that local effects of rolling   shutter are non significant and thus use the same algorithms and   descriptors to match the points of interest between views from a   sequence. the objective of this thesis is therefore to define a local   model for pattern distortions induced by the rolling shutter in the   vicinity of a points of interest. modeling the impact on known   descriptors such as sift or surf is also planned to improve the   robustness and the efficiency of the matching process. the candidate should have a good image processing and computer vision   basis. he must also master programming in matlab and/or c++. academic context comsee is a computer vision research team based at pascal institute, a   joint research unit of cnrs (french nat?l research council), ubp   (blaise pascal university), and ifma (french institute of mechanics).   moreover, several comsee members are linked to the universit?   d?auvergne. comsee is part of the pascal institute/ispr group, which   focuses research in perception, robotics and computer vision. it is   located near clermont-ferrand in the central region of france. comsee has been prospecting for computer vision and photogrammetry   based solutions for 3d localisation, 3d reconstruction, sensor   calibration and real-time tracking for about 20 years. it has been   involved in the creation of several companies : poseidon, dxo, ... comsee focuses on two main research paradigms : image matching and 3d   reconstruction and is structured as follow: ?	visual geometry and 3d reconstruction ; ?	image matching, recognition and tracking. more details at http://www.ip.univ-bpclermont.fr conditions: the monthly net salary is approximately 1650? for a 3-year contract. the phd would ideally start in september/october 2015. contact: o. ait-aider  (institut pascal cnrs / universit? blaise pascal   clermont ferrand ii) t?l. +334 73 40 55 67 email : omar.ait-aider at univ-bpclermont.fr to obtain further information or to apply (providing a cv) -- "

3328,2015,two phd positions in human-robot  interaction (marie sklodowska-curie early-stage researchers posts)," secure project- two marie sklodowska-curie early-stage researchers posts in human-robot interaction at university of hertfordshire two phd positions for marie sklodowska-curie itn project secure (safety enables cooperation in uncertain robotic environments) at the university of hertfordshire's school of computer science. uh is a partner in the project secure, led by university of hamburg and involving 6 universities. human-robot interaction (hri) is a quickly growing research area with a number of applications in assistive technology and service robotics. the research team at university of hertfordshire led by prof. kerstin dautenhahn is involved in a number of projects relevant to this field. the research group has excellent infrastructure to carry out hri experiments, including a dedicated ""robot house"" as well as an hri experimental laboratory. several state of the art robots are used, including the icub, care-o-bot3, kaspar, sunflower, baxter robots etc. the positions will focus on the care-o-bot 3 (developed by fraunhofer, stuttgart) and the sunflower robot (developed at university of hertfordshire). researchers are expected to pursue full-time phd research in the two positions. post 1: exploiting social cues for safe human-robot interaction in home environments the objectives of this phd project are to create guidelines and to develop a system that will allow robots to utilize social cues that significantly improve safe human-robot interaction in home environments. this involves first investigating and understanding of 1) human safety risk during human-robot interaction in home environments, 2) the features that help humans to believe and trust that robots are able to look after their well-being, 3) social cues related to a human alert system that users are sensitive of and that can be implemented in robots to signal safety risks to the users. based on the findings a guideline will be created, implemented and tested to verify and improve the guideline for developing a system that can utilize social cues to ensure safe human-robot interaction in home environments. the results will enable robots to use effective social cues to signal users' safety risk during human-robot interaction in home environments. this will ensure that the users will be aware of any risk to their safety during human-robot interaction and that robots can promote safe interactions for novice users. post 2: social learning for robot home companion assistance the objectives of this second phd project are to develop socially inspired techniques whereby through interaction with a human a robot learns patterns and limits for its own and the human's safety. this may be achieved through techniques of observing scenarios within a domestic environment, or directly from teaching signals generated by the human partner. for example the robot could learn, via observation of human behaviour in the house, that it is important for a human to always be present if the cooker is on a high setting and warn the person accordingly if this is not the case. in direct interaction with the robot teaching signals could be used to indicate to the robot as to what is a safe and preferred interaction distance or for example areas in the house which would be unsafe for the robot to enter. over time and though interaction the robot would learn the safety procedures operating within a typical household environment. these procedures may in fact be obvious to the human, and therefore not explicitly recognized, however we would expect the robot to infer these procedures from observing the human and house environments via interaction or from polling its own and environmental sensors. both phd research will involve the design and implementation of hri experiments, the analysis of the data and writing up of the results for scientific publication. both projects involve significant programming. the postholders will be part of a larger research team consisting of researchers working in several projects, including several horizon2020 projects as well as nationally funded projects. research in computer science at the university of hertfordshire has been recognized as excellent in the ref 2014, with 50% of the

3335,2015,phd position in quantifying insect  vision for biorobotic inspiration," i would like to announce the opening of the following phd position in the baird/dacke lab in the lund vision group at lund university in  sweden . the position will be available in early 2016. for more detailed information and expressions of interest please contact emily baird (emily.baird at biol.lu.se). project description: flying bees are able to use visual information to control flight and navigate in visually distinct environments, ranging from dark cluttered rainforests in the tropics to the open tundra of the arctic circle. does the efficiency with which different bees perform visually guided tasks in their diverse native habitats depend on specialized flight control systems, or do many use similar, inherently robust, schema? recent work in our lab has shown that variations do exist in the eye morphology within single bee genera where species are native to different habitats. this suggests that specialisations do occur - at least in the sensory structures that extract visual information from the environment. yet, environment specific specialisations are poorly characterised and it is unknown how they lead to functional differences in behaviour between species. the aim of this project is to investigate how evolution has shaped the visual flight control systems of bees, enabling them to safely guide their flight through the diverse range of environments that they inhabit. the project will involve quantifying the anatomy and flight behaviour of different species and using this information to generate mathematical models and simulations of guidance systems that will then be implemented on small flying robotic platforms to both test the validity of the biological principles that we discover and to develop useful, lightweight and efficient systems that can be used to safely guide autonomous robots through different natural environments. the anatomical focus of the project will be to use information from advanced micro computed tomography techniques, performed at synchrotron light sources, to construct functional optical and anatomical models of the eyes (left) and peripheral brain structures of several bee species. simulations based on those models will allow us to understand what information bees perceive in different visual environments and to relate each specialisation to the visual cues available in the habitat it evolved in. behavioural experiments will be performed at our field-sites in brazil, . and  sweden , and in our state-of-the-art laboratory setup in  sweden . the focus of behavioural experiments will aim to elucidate how any identified anatomical specialisations influence specific species ability for flight control and navigation. the results of this study will provide fundamental insights into task and environment specific visual processing strategies used by small insects in flight. through our close collaboration with the laboratory of intelligent systems at the swiss federal institute of technology, we aim to develop the principles that we learn from this study into guidance strategies that can be implemented on small flying robots. qualifications: the applicant should have demonstrated experience with computational and quantitative analysis of experimental or simulated data sets. a background in engineering or computer science is preferred but candidates with other backgrounds will be considered if technical competence can be demonstrated. previous experience in programming and image analysis using matlab (or another programming language) is highly desirable."

3338,2015,two phd positions in human-robot  interaction (marie sklodowska-curie early-stage researchers posts)," unfortunately i need to resend the email since the link provided at the end of the email on how to apply did not work. sorry for the inconvenience. kerstin dautenhahn ----------------------------------------- secure project- two marie sklodowska-curie early-stage researchers posts in human-robot interaction at university of hertfordshire two phd positions for marie sklodowska-curie itn project secure (safety enables cooperation in uncertain robotic environments) at the university of hertfordshire's school of computer science. uh is a partner in the project secure, led by university of hamburg and involving 6 universities. human-robot interaction (hri) is a quickly growing research area with a number of applications in assistive technology and service robotics. the research team at university of hertfordshire led by prof. kerstin dautenhahn is involved in a number of projects relevant to this field. the research group has excellent infrastructure to carry out hri experiments, including a dedicated ""robot house"" as well as an hri experimental laboratory. several state of the art robots are used, including the icub, care-o-bot3, kaspar, sunflower, baxter robots etc. the positions will focus on the care-o-bot 3 (developed by fraunhofer, stuttgart) and the sunflower robot (developed at university of hertfordshire). researchers are expected to pursue full-time phd research in the two positions. post 1: exploiting social cues for safe human-robot interaction in home environments the objectives of this phd project are to create guidelines and to develop a system that will allow robots to utilize social cues that significantly improve safe human-robot interaction in home environments. this involves first investigating and understanding of 1) human safety risk during human-robot interaction in home environments, 2) the features that help humans to believe and trust that robots are able to look after their well-being, 3) social cues related to a human alert system that users are sensitive of and that can be implemented in robots to signal safety risks to the users. based on the findings a guideline will be created, implemented and tested to verify and improve the guideline for developing a system that can utilize social cues to ensure safe human-robot interaction in home environments. the results will enable robots to use effective social cues to signal users' safety risk during human-robot interaction in home environments. this will ensure that the users will be aware of any risk to their safety during human-robot interaction and that robots can promote safe interactions for novice users. post 2: social learning for robot home companion assistance the objectives of this second phd project are to develop socially inspired techniques whereby through interaction with a human a robot learns patterns and limits for its own and the human's safety. this may be achieved through techniques of observing scenarios within a domestic environment, or directly from teaching signals generated by the human partner. for example the robot could learn, via observation of human behaviour in the house, that it is important for a human to always be present if the cooker is on a high setting and warn the person accordingly if this is not the case. in direct interaction with the robot teaching signals could be used to indicate to the robot as to what is a safe and preferred interaction distance or for example areas in the house which would be unsafe for the robot to enter. over time and though interaction the robot would learn the safety procedures operating within a typical household environment. these procedures may in fact be obvious to the human, and therefore not explicitly recognized, however we would expect the robot to infer these procedures from observing the human and house environments via interaction or from polling its own and environmental sensors. both phd research will involve the design and implementation of hri experiments, the analysis of the data and writing up of the results for scientific publication. both projects involve significant programming. the postholders will be part of a larger research team consisting of researchers working in several projects, including several horizon2020 projects as well as nationally funded projects. research in computer science at the university of hertfordshire has been recognized as excellent in the ref 2014, with 50% of the research submitted rated as internationally excellent or world leading. the science and technology research institute provides a very stimulating environment, offering a

""this initiative will bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and application expertise, leading to new synergies and applications that can better address societal grand challenges,"" lach said. one thrust of the research will be to address the potential risks created by dependency on cyber-physical systems. ""the challenge is to achieve the benefits of the technology while maintaining human control, privacy, and safety,"" said professor kevin skadron, chair of the department of computer science, one of several departments that will have a role in fully developing the cyber-physical systems initiative. ""we have to manage design flaws and software vulnerabilities that could hurt the user or compromise security."" brian smith, chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering and director of its center for transportation studies, leads a research team supporting federal and state government efforts to develop ""connected"" technologies and applications that allow vehicles and the infrastructure to work together to make travel safer and more efficient. smith said, ""our work in connected vehicles has brought to the forefront the need to address cyber-security issues. these issues are complicated, requiring teams with expertise across a wide range of engineering disciplines."" eric loth, chair of the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, noted that autonomous airborne vehicles - drones - are ever-important cyber-physical systems to a wide variety of agencies and companies. ""in addition, as automobile technology matures from crash avoidance to driver-assisted and eventually fully autonomous vehicles, uva's world-leading research in vehicle safety will leverage the availability of new sensing and control algorithms to further push the boundaries of occupant protection to mitigate injuries and save lives,"" he said. commonwealth associate professor kamin whitehouse, whose research includes smart home technologies such as a new generation of smart home thermostats, said, ""we anticipate a strong pool of international candidates who will be attracted by the opportunity to conduct groundbreaking research for the greater good."" more information about the initiative can be found at http://linklab.virginia.edu. the new faculty and the lab are expected to be in place beginning late spring 2016, whitehouse said. university of virginia school of engineering and applied science: www.seas.virginia.edu<http://www.seas.virginia.edu>"

3345,2015,post-doctoral position at inria-crisam 	on gait analysis using walker apparatus," gait analysis is classically used by the medical community for functional and cognitive assessment of frail people. indeed gait alteration may reflect compensations for underlying pathology such as musculoskeletal disorders, vision alteration, neurological disorders such as parkinson and depression. in addition this alteration  may lead to falls which is a major leading cause of accident for people over 65. the demographic evolution makes this last  problem particularly important both for the individuals, but also for the entire society through its financial consequence. this advocate for a carefully and regular evaluation of the gait in particular for aging persons. this evaluation  is usually performed at hospital or during a doctor's visit, and in addition to be time consuming for the medical staff, cannot be done frequently enough for an early detection of a risk factor. continuous gait monitoring may constitute an efficient solution for a timely detection of gait alteration. for that purpose the hephaistos team has developed several devices such as instrumented walkers and canes allowing a  continuous measurement of gait parameters such as speed, number and  length of the steps and support forces but also of other new indicators (maneuvering area, trajectory deviation, ....) that have been shown to be very sensitive to gait alteration. furthermore our first results have shown that the measurement of gait parameters with these devices are usually quite accurate, while not requiring expensive systems. the aim of this postdoctoral position is to process the data generated by the team's devices in order to produce significant risk indicators. especially we are interested in developing a two steps methodology for risk assessment: 1- taking into account measurement uncertainties for gait quantification, thereby producing minimal interval for the indicators values that are guaranteed to include the ground truth, with the additional advantage that the width of the interval characterizes the quality of the measurement 2- perform a statistical analysis of the interval gait parameters for providing an interpretation of gait alteration and therefore identifying possible risks step 1 is performed using the mathematical method of interval analysis for which the hephaistos project have an expertise. data for step 2 will be obtained with the help of several medical teams with which the team has a long standing collaboration. serious competences in c programming and in statistical analysis is required. knowledge in medical procedure, biomechanics and signal processing would be appreciated, while an intensive formation on interval analysis will be provided by the team. for more information on the team see :  http://www.inria.fr/equipes/hephaistos <http://www.inria.fr/equipes/hephaistos> duration : 24 months starting autumn 2016. location : inria, hephaistos team, sophia antipolis, france. scientific supervisors : jean pierre merlet, odile pourtallier. for more information please contact odile pourtallier  (odile.pourtallier at free.fr <mailto:odile.pourtallier at free.fr>) by november 6th 2015."

3539,2015,phd at  institut pascal (france) - optimal multimodal control for asbestos removal  robots," *context of phd: bots2rec project* many houses and industrial buildings are no more healthy due to the presence of asbestos. nowadays, the removal tasks of asbestos in buildings are performed by human operators wearing a hermetically sealed suit and isolating the environment so that asbestos leaks are avoided. obviously, these conditions are not only uncomfortable for human operators and also exhausting and dangerous so that each operator has to take a break after a maximum of 2 hours of working. the european project h2020 bots2rec has as main goal the development of collaborative mobile manipulators that release human operators for these dangerous and tough operations. the consortium of the project is composed by an important construction industry, 4 european sme and 2 research labs, including institut pascal at clermont-ferrand where this phd thesis will be developed. *phd scientific objectives* the phd candidate should concentrate in the development of the local control framework of the mobile manipulator equipped with a special tool at the end-effector for removing abestos from vertical walls. the control approach will be based in a multi-modal strategy where the information coming from several sensors (force sensors, vision sensors and radar) will be combined to execute and monitor the cleaning task. this control approach will be connected with a high-level planning developed by other members of the consortium that will establish the global trajectory of the robot in the environment in cooperation with other robots. this global trajectory will be adapted locally by the control framework according to the status of the cleaning task monitored from vision data while force data will guarantee keeping the contact with the wall. the developed control approach should also include safety procedures for humans entering in the working area and data feedback for basic tele-operation by external human operators. the developed control framework should also coordinate with the planning level in order to update the plan of the environment for tracking the areas of the environment that have been treated and the areas of the environment that have to be treated next. *candidate's profile* in order to complete this project, we are looking for a candidate with the next skills : - good theoretical basis in the control of robotic manipulators, visual servoing, force control, computer vision and mobile robot localization. - good programming skills in c++. - previous knowledge in ros, opencv and/or pcl will be highly appreciated. - previous experience with the integration of robotic manipulators (such as kuka lwr) in industrial projects will be desirable. - previous experience in slam techniques and localization in maps with mobile robots will be desirable. - advanced knowledge of spoken and written english (c1 or c2 recommended). some knowledge of french will be appreciated. - previous research experience in the field of robotic manipulators control and robotic manipulation is desirable. the retained phd student should be highly motivated for completing a phd thesis in 3 years, with high creativity, a solid theoretical basis in robotics, dynamism for working in a research team of practical integration but also autonomy for developing research. *candidature's instructions* the candidates should send their candidatures via email at *youcef.mezouar at ifma.fr <youcef.mezouar at ifma.fr>*, *jcorralesr at ifma.fr <jcorralesr at ifma.fr>* and *jean-christophe.fauroux at ifma.fr <jean-christophe.fauroux at ifma.fr>*, including: (1) their cvs, (2) motivation letter, (3) transcripts of previous university degrees (unofficial are enough now), (4) previous research publications (if existing) and (5) contact information of 2 or 3 people who could serve as references."
