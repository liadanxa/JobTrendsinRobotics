everyday lives. this has led to increasing research in the area of robotics for domestic environments such as social robots and companion robots. these robots are intended to be used to provide assistance and companionship in different contexts to support human activities in daily living. they are expected to perform tasks according to social expectation and to interact with people in a socially acceptable fashion. the area we are particularly interested in is end-user personalisation of companion robots in order to improve long-term user interaction. personalisation is an important aspect of human-robot interaction (hri) that aids long-term user engagement with a robotic companion beyond an initial habituation period. personalisation goes beyond just robot appearances, specifically into aspects that allows end-users to teach a robot to perform new tasks in ways that matches users? expectation. robots that can adapt to users? needs will be more personalised, useful and appreciated by the users. this will help the robots form a stronger relationship with their users, which previous studies have found that the ability of a socially assistive agent/robot to form a relationship with its user is important to maintain its continued use. potential investigations in this area includes, but is not limited to:   *   software architecture and planning for social robots   *   task abilities and functionalities to support activities of daily living and long-term engagement with users   *   perception of users? control and trust in companion robots   *   expressive robot behaviours   *   adaptive multimodal hris   *   end-user personalisation requirements applicants are required to have a strong first degree or (preferably) a specialist master?s degree in computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics or a related field with a strong background in mathematical and statistical knowledge, as well as technical and programming skills in python or c++. prior knowledge and experience in programming mobile robots and experience or interest in social sciences or psychology are desirable. candidates are expected to have excellent english oral and writing skills as well as general interest in interdisciplinary research and willingness to collaborate with researchers from other disciplines. the phd project will be supervised by dr. kheng lee koay (k.l.koay at herts.ac.uk<mailto:k.l.koay at herts.ac.uk>), whom interested candidates are invited to contact via email in the first instance. successful candidates may be eligible for a research studentship award from the university (?15,285 per annum bursary plus the payment of the student fees). applications from outside the uk are also eligible for this studentship. the application deadline is 29 of january 2021 the studentship offers the opportunity to work within the adaptive systems research group (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://adapsys.cs.herts.ac.uk/people/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!-40irhtlx3g9zstxqyxfmnzgstxxn_zrc_rqmdxwzxy6jd2veyndrflcnu8dimxiycfhuqyv$ ), a proactive, dynamic and interdisciplinary research team with an excellent international research profile and state-of-the-art facilities to conduct research into human-robot interaction. the university (https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.herts.ac.uk/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!-40irhtlx3g9zstxqyxfmnzgstxxn_zrc_rqmdxwzxy6jd2veyndrflcnu8dimxiygvfsqcs$ ) is located in hatfield with convenient access to london and nearby international airports. all formal applications must be made via the research office. how to apply download the application form:  <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/31105/uh-application-form.pdf__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!-40irhtlx3g9zstxqyxfmnzgstxxn_zrc_rqmdxwzxy6jd2veyndrflcnu8dimxiykbixqxu$ > please note: you must download the application form to your computer before you complete it. if you complete the form in the browser window, the information you have entered may be lost when the form is saved. in your application form, you will have to clearly indicate the project you are applying for (i.e. social robotics and robotic companions under the supervision of dr. kheng lee koay). in your application, you should include a research statement stating your previous experience/research background, motivation to join the current project and area of interest within the project. your application should also include: - two academic references - copies of qualification certificates and transcripts of previous academic degrees the application form should be returned to: lynette spelman and emma thorogood research student administrators university of hertfordshire hatfield hertfordshire al10 9ab doctoralcollegeadmissions at herts.ac.uk<mailto:doctoralcollegeadmissions at herts.ac.uk> we accept applications for self-funded places throughout the year. the next short-listing process for studentship applications will begin on 29 of january 2021. ----------------------------------------------------- dr. kheng lee koay adaptive systems research group university of hertfordshire, department of computer science college lane, hatfield, hertfordshire al10 9ab, united kingdom e-mail: k.l.koay at herts.ac.uk<mailto:k.l.koay at herts.ac.uk> tel: +44-1707-281-026"

9337,2021,phd in robotic language acquisition &  dialogue systems," [apologies for cross posting] ============ phd studentship robotic language acquisition & dialogue systems adaptive systems research group centre for computer science and informatics research school of engineering and computer science university of hertfordshire, uk contact: frank foerster (f.foerster at herts.ac.uk<mailto:f.foerster at herts.ac.uk>) ============ short-listings will start on 29 january 2021* bursary ?15,285 p.a. * application before this date is strongly encouraged we invite applications for a phd studentship at the university of hertfordshire, uk, under the supervision of dr. frank foerster in the area of robotic language acquisition and potential applications to dialogue systems. we are particularly interested in pursuing research that connects to the following two topics, but alternative ideas will be considered too. *research topics* topic 1: socially driven machine learning in robotic language acquisition we have developed a language acquisition approach that strongly relies on social cues similar to those present in child-directed speech (cds). the big advantage of this approach is that it can cope with unconstrained robot-directed speech rather than relying on heavily structured and constrained natural language input by eliciting vocal behaviour from human participants similar to that found in cds. we have reasons to believe that the application of reinforcement learning in its widest sense may lead to large improvements of the core learning algorithm. this research topic involves areas ranging from human-robot interaction, over machine learning, and social signal processing, to affective computing. topic 2: linking robotic language-acquisition research with dialogue systems historically robotic language acquisition research has been mostly restricted to developmental robotics and similarly small research areas. more recently, the larger computer vision and dialogue systems communities have picked up on some of the ideas such as symbol grounding. so far, these approaches focused largely on the grounding ( = attaching meaning to) of referential words such as object labels, tangible actions and events. part of our past research has focused on the grounding of non-referential words, including negation words, relating to ?non-tangible? concepts such as affect or volition. we believe that dialogue systems could benefit from approaches in developmental robotics that focus on such ?non-referential? utterances, and invite the prospective student to explore this space. independent of the particular topic, we have recently become member of the homebank corpora, and would strongly encourage interaction and collaboration with developmental psychologists and psycholinguists. *person profile* you will have an excellent first degree and a very keen interest and motivation in language or language acquisition. optimally you should have an excellent background in computer science, computational/cognitive robotics, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence, or similar disciplines with a considerable quantitative/computational component. due to the interdisciplinary nature of the topic we will also consider applicants with a background in (developmental) psychology, philosophy, or pragmatics as long as you have some experience in programming, machine learning, or dialogue systems. prior experience with topics such as reinforcement learning, or statistical learning more generally is highly desirable, but not essential if the quantitative background is otherwise very strong. the knowledge of later wittgenstein is a big plus. more information including relevant papers are provided in the following pdf: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/317440/robotic-language-acquisition-and-dialogue-systems.pdf__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8cx9glmnjfgezszdtnor4sr4aodxerpz2_zx5wofe5vlrqojndxufggeg0tvfbc_saf5u-ok$  *location* research in computer science at the university of hertfordshire has been recognised as excellent by the latest research assessment exercise, with 50% of the research submitted being rated as internationally excellent or world leading. the university of hertfordshire provides a very stimulating environment, offering a large number of specialised and interdisciplinary seminars as well as general training and researcher development opportunities. the university is situated in hatfield, in the green belt just north of london. hatfield is close to central london (less than 25 minutes by direct train to kings cross), with convenient access to stansted, luton and heathrow airports, and, via the nearby historic town of st. albans, also to gatwick airport. application forms and submission instructions are available under https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.herts.ac.uk/study/schools-of-study/physics-engineering-and-computer-science/engineering-and-computer-science/research-in-engineering-and-computer-science/the-phd-programme-in-computer-science__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8cx9glmnjfgezszdtnor4sr4aodxerpz2_zx5wofe5vlrqojndxufggeg0tvfbc_sei59c0q$  please note: you must download the application form to your computer before you complete it. if you complete the form in the browser window, the information you have entered may be lost when the form is saved. *eligibility* applications from outside the uk or eu are eligible for this studentship. if you have questions or would like to discuss alternative project ideas, please contact dr. frank foerster (f.foerster at herts.ac.uk<mailto:f.foerster at herts.ac.uk>) ===================================================================== frank foerster senior lecturer school of engineering and computer science university of hertfordshire member of the adaptive systems research group (asrg) - https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://adapsys.cs.herts.ac.uk/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8cx9glmnjfgezszdtnor4sr4aodxerpz2_zx5wofe5vlrqojndxufggeg0tvfbc_sfl5we0e$  visiting lecturer centre for advanced robotics at queen mary - https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8cx9glmnjfgezszdtnor4sr4aodxerpz2_zx5wofe5vlrqojndxufggeg0tvfbc_sbvztojt$  school of electronic engineering and computer science queen mary university of london ====================================================================="

machine/deep learning techniques and software libraries. *intention detection for physical human-robot interaction * *using machine/deep learning* cobots (collaborative robots) are designed with the aim to integrate human cognitive abilities and quick adaptation skills with the speed, strength, and repeatability of robots. as cobots penetrate into different domains such as manufacturing, logistics, medicine, home use, etc, it is becoming increasingly clear that the skills expected from them are significantly different from what is expected from industrial robots. in fact, many of these skills centers on the challenge of interacting with humans. in particular, understanding human intention during a collaborative task and then adjusting the interaction controller of the cobot accordingly to comply with human intention is a major challenge in physical human-robot interaction (phri). *the post-doctoral fellow is expected to design human-human and human-robot experiments,

*displaying realistic haptic feedback on touch surfaces using machine/deep learning* haptics for interactive touch surfaces, also known as surface haptics, is a new area of research in the field of haptics. the goal of surface haptics is to generate tactile effects on touch surfaces such as those used in mobile phones, tablets, kiosks and information displays, and front panels of new generation home appliances and cars. integration of haptics into touch surfaces will result in new applications in user interface design, online shopping, gaming and entertainment, education, arts, and more. currently, one of the most promising techniques to generate tactile effects on a touch surface is electrostatic actuation.  when an alternating voltage is applied to the conductive layer of a capacitive touch screen, an attractive electrostatic force is generated in the normal direction between the finger and the surface. by controlling the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of the input voltage, the frictional force between the sliding finger and the touch screen can be modulated. in this context, one important aim is to render realistic virtual textures on touch screens (see the figure below). texture information on touch screens would improve the user experience in daily activities. for example, feeling the simulated texture of a jean before purchasing it from internet would certainly be more motivating for online shoppers. despite the current advances in hardware, tactile rendering algorithms have yet to reach the realism necessary to simulate a wide range of textures due to variations in their a) physical attributes (e.g. roughness, kurtosis, skewness, etc.), b) psychological attributes (e.g. fine, course, smooth, sticky, etc.) and c) affective attributes (e.g. cool, wavy, granular, repetitive, elegant, etc.). *the post-doctoral fellow is expected to design experiments to collect data from real textured surfaces and develop machine/deep learning algorithms to generate their virtual counterparts by establishing the links between those attributes. she/he is expected to have research experience in human-computer interaction, surface haptics, texture modeling and rendering, and machine/deep learning with background in cs, ee, or me.* *some related references:* 1.     basdogan, c., giraud, f., levesque, v., choi, s., 2020, ?a review of surface

9352,2021,postdoctoral position at rice  university with professors kavraki and vardi - analysis techniques for dnns," rice university -- postdoctoral position a postdoctoral researcher is sought for a two-year position in computer science at rice university to work with professors lydia kavraki and moshe vardi on analysis techniques for deep neural networks (dnns). the impressive capabilities of deep neural networks have inspired system developers to use them in safety-critical cyber-physical control systems, such as autonomous vehicles and air traffic collision avoidance systems. for such applications it is imperative that the correctness of dnn systems be verified. furthermore, it is desirable that such system be resistant to perturbations introduced by an adversary, or by inadvertent data corruption from system noise, domain shift, or broken sensors. several recent incidents have underscored the need to better understand dnns, and verify both their safety and security.  this project aims at developing techniques for analysis of dnns by combining methods from formal methods, cyber-physical systems, and robotics. we are seeking candidates who have demonstrated ability to lead and/or work collaboratively in teams comprised of individuals of diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives. background: applicants must hold a ph.d. in computer science, electrical & computer

develop a dynamic model of the system (soft bodies attached to the  drones) able to run in real time for being used in a control loop. finding a good compromise for modelling the system (accuracy vs.  computational time) will be crucial - observation of the internal state: estimation of the soft bodies  deformation based on the developed model and external sensors (e.g., vision) - control of the soft bodies deformation using robust, adaptive or  predictive strategies - experimental validation: the intended benchmark will consist of at  least two drones manipulating a single soft rod with the aim of imposing  a desired shape to the rod and to displace it to a desired location. the  final experiment will represent a first concrete step towards the full  grasping of an object with the system uavs+soft body. for this, we are  going to consider the following scenario: surrounding a vertical pole  with the soft body as in the following illustration *********** candidate's expected profile *********** the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink is a plus. scientific curiosity, large autonomy and  ability to work independently are also expected. a m.sc. degree in computer science, robotics, engineering, applied  mathematics (or related fields) is required. *candidates lacking a clear background in nonlinear control and/or  advanced mechanics will not be considered.* the phd aims at advancing the state-of-the-art from both the  *methodological/theoretical* and *experimental* points of view. therefore, the candidate is expected to have a strong passion (and  attitude) towards problem solving on the methodological and experimental  sides. *********** salary *********** the position is full-time for 3 years and will be paid according to the  french salary regulations for phd students. ***********  environment *********** the armen team https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ls2n.fr/equipe/armen/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie5u-ml9x$  is creating original research results in design, control and perception  in the field of autonomous robots and of the control of their  interactions with the environment. designing and controlling systems  able to address the two facets of the term environment (in the sense of  the environment in which the robot evolves or in the ecological sense of  the term) are two priority objectives of the team. the main issues  addressed concern the control of the dynamics of robotic systems and  their environment, the gain in autonomy and the minimization of the  environmental impact. the facilities available in the group include a fleet of autonomous  industrial cars, a platform for prototyping industrial-size industrial  and aerial robots, a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing  arena instrumented with qualisys motion capture system. the rainbow team https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie6bfz6o4$  is internationally recognized for its scientific activity as well as for  technology transfer experience in the field of visual tracking, visual  servoing, computer vision, shared control, haptics and sensor-based  control for robotics applications. the facilities available in the group  include three 6-dof industrial manipulator arms, a 6-dof  torque-controlled backdrivable arm, two 7-dof torque-controlled robot  arms (franka), a pioneer indoor mobile robot, a humanoid robot (pepper),  a fleet of quadrotor uavs, and an indoor testing arena instrumented with  vicon. the candidate will be under the supervision of *dr. s. briot* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/*briot-s/__;fg!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037piezexqqkt$  *dr. paolo robuffo giordano* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie4-tyyy2$  and *prof. a. chriette* https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/abdelhamid*20chriette/__;jq!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie9jsfrar$  and will work in close collaboration with other members of the armen and  rainbow teams involved in the project. ***********  how to apply  *********** instructions on how to apply can be found at https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/manip-soft-drone-3/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie4siwsmr$  the position will remain open until a satisfactory candidate is found --  dr. paolo robuffo giordano centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs) rainbow team, irisa and inria bretagne atlantique campus universitaire de beaulieu 35042 rennes cedex, france tel: +33 (0)2 99842545 fax: +33 (0)2 99847171 email: prg at irisa.fr website: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie4-tyyy2$  youtube: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucihvw3xxlbgxr4-9zalju8w__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!4pm0d7nqgavlh0ahqew_of2gejvq8v4alk87yrmc2b_3j0w9qfn7gawqxsg037pie0vhmhlt$ "

9382,2021,"phd in swarm robotics / computational  modelling at the university of lincoln, uk"," this project aims to develop physical models of collective behaviour derived from biological systems comprising self-propelling agents, such as schools of fish and flocks of birds, and to then transform them into swarming behaviours of mobile robots. the ultimate aim is to improve the design of complex behaviours for robot swarms by integrating elements of collective intelligence inspired by biological agents. active matter is an emerging interdisciplinary field in physics and applied mathematics that refers to systems comprising interacting agents that can drive their own motion (such as birds, fish, insects, ?smart? artificial micro-particles, or bio-mimicking robots). active matter systems are opposed to inert matter systems, whose behaviours are entirely determined by the mechanical interactions between the agents. consequently, in the past two decades active matter models have demonstrated complex collective behaviours such as the formation of active clusters, obstacle induced phase separation, and organised flocking motions, which are usually not achievable in assemblies of inert agents. these newly found ?living structures? can in turn be implemented in real life with collections of bacteria, artificial micro-particles, or bio-mimicking robots for industrial, medical or agricultural applications making use of their self-assembling properties and resilience to external influences. in active matter systems, simple sets of rules can lead to many rich phases of collective behaviours. there is ample opportunity to develop new classes of rules that can give rise to never-before-seen phases, and ultimately provide insights into how to reverse-engineer rules for targeted goals. active matter systems are of particular interest with respect to swarm robotic systems where the behaviour of individual robots is affected by the fluid dynamics of their environment; for example, aerial drones whose position may drift when buffeted by gusts of wind, or surface-water/underwater vessels that may be dragged along by water currents. these swarm robotic systems must coordinate their movement despite the influence of the fluid environment they inhabit. by translating the mechanics of active matter systems to swarm robotic systems, we hope to improve the performance of embodied agents used in real-world applications. this novel approach would be particularly beneficial in gps-denied environments such as deep-sea exploration, where individual robots must remain aggregated without the aid of an external frame of reference. this interdisciplinary project at the interface of physics, computational modelling, and robotics will develop new theoretical and computational models for such systems and validate them on physical robotic swarms. it will broadly consist of three main tasks: - formulating a set of microscopic rules deduced from a set of bio-inspired active matter systems, and formulating a statistical physics description of a large groups of such active matter systems - deriving continuous field models starting from these microscopic rules to describe the collective behaviour of active matter - validating the developed models through their implementation on aerial/surface-water robot swarms ? initially in the widely-used argos multi-robot simulator, and then on physical hardware this project combines complementary expertise from two schools: the school of mathematics and physics and the school of computer science, building on existing research. the successful student will be associated with the centre for computational physics and the lincoln centre for autonomous systems (l-cas), of which the supervisory team are members. skills the candidate can learn: - theoretical and computational modelling - design of control algorithms for robot swarms - interdisciplinary collaboration skills - national and international collaboration skills - technical oral presentation and written communication skills ideal candidates: interested applicants should hold, at a minimum, a 2.1 degree in either physics, mathematics, computer science, engineering, or a related discipline. applicants with a relevant master's degree are particularly welcome. the candidate is expected to have good communication and teamwork skills and must be motivated to learn new things. interested applicants are encouraged to demonstrate any skills and/or experience relevant to the project subject area(s) of interest. supervisory team: dr fabien paillusson, university of lincoln dr alan millard, university of lincoln prof andrei zvelindovsky, university of lincoln for more details, including how to apply: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/engineering/dtpstudentships/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!48v_nkmqo9l2lli15orw7vwrdg8ww6rvlcypf7s6llr-ms3hnkvffxn4ikytsrl6c4-uvujb$  informal enquiries can be made to dr alan millard: amillard at lincoln.ac.uk --- dr alan millard senior lecturer - computer science (autonomous systems) lincoln centre for autonomous systems, school of computer science, college of science university of lincoln. brayford pool, lincoln, lincolnshire. ln6 7ts"

9429,2021,6 months internship position in  developmental robotics and cognitive modeling of the acquisition of  language in robots," 6 months internship position in developmental robotics and cognitive modeling of the acquisition of language in robots  context : language understanding has recently been a central topic of interest with the emergence of new applications such as new generation research algorithms (e.g., google search), conversational agents, smart homes and social human-robots (or avatars) interaction. until now, most of this research is focused on speech recognition (nlp), speech generation (phonology), grammatic rules extraction, and objects labelling. all these approaches rely mostly on language as a stream of (phonological or written) text of everyday language. although these approaches have led to fundamental advances on our understanding of human language, the semantic aspect of language has not received a strong attention yet in the field of ai. however, developmental psychology emphasizes the importance of semantics in language acquisition, as infants acquire language in a way that is meaningful to them (e.g., they learn first the words corresponding to their close environment and needs). furthermore, the language that they learn is always embedded in a social interactive context (e.g., language games). in this project, we take the stance that language is not only words and grammar, but the active transmission of meanings, through communicative gestures, intonation, gaze, etc.  objective : the objective of this project is twofold: (1) to increase our understanding of how humans develop categories of objects by providing a functional cognitive model to reproduce key properties of human learning, and (2) to show the ability of our approach to complement current methods of artificial language learning (e.g. deep learning methods) by providing a solution that does not require huge datasets of labeled data to learn communication skills. to this end, our method will exploit findings in developmental psychology to propose a new approach for ai acquisition of object categories that will bridge the gap between language processing and semantics in human-robot interaction.  internship topics:  ? multimodal acquisition of communication skills in robots  ? reinforcement learning (contextual multi-armed bandit, markov models)  ? neural networks, image processing  ? human-robot interaction  profile:  ? last year of master degree in computer science, electrical engineering or related subjects (ai is a plus).  ? programming skills in python/c++/matlab  ? interest in understanding child development through cognitive modelling  ? communication skills in scientific research  ? good academic record  starting date: april  allowance under the official standards (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/f32131__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs7kwshbt$ ).  location : the internship will take place at etis lab, neurocyber group and will be supervised by laura cohen (laura.cohen at cyu.fr). the lab is located at campus saint martin, cy cergy-paris university, cergy-pontoise, france.  how to apply : if you are interested in this position, please send your cv and cover letter to laura.cohen at cyu.fr  ---  laura cohen  ma?tre de conf?rences  etis-neurocybern?tique / iut de cergy-pontoise  [ https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs3nhn6vs$  | https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs4xpvzla$  ]  [ https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cyu.fr/?signlogo__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!9c9axs4iyyy3qz1kqanuswhy_g01loox8l2rplapd2vtomwmpzx7hmcsq0tnypwqs770iob-$  ] "

9492,2021,"phd in swarm robotics / computational  modelling at the university of lincoln, uk - deadline extended"," this project aims to develop physical models of collective behaviour derived from biological systems comprising self-propelling agents, such as schools of fish and flocks of birds, and to then transform them into swarming behaviours of mobile robots. the ultimate aim is to improve the design of complex behaviours for robot swarms by integrating elements of collective intelligence inspired by biological agents. active matter is an emerging interdisciplinary field in physics and applied mathematics that refers to systems comprising interacting agents that can drive their own motion (such as birds, fish, insects, ?smart? artificial micro-particles, or bio-mimicking robots). active matter systems are opposed to inert matter systems, whose behaviours are entirely determined by the mechanical interactions between the agents. consequently, in the past two decades active matter models have demonstrated complex collective behaviours such as the formation of active clusters, obstacle induced phase separation, and organised flocking motions, which are usually not achievable in assemblies of inert agents. these newly found ?living structures? can in turn be implemented in real life with collections of bacteria, artificial micro-particles, or bio-mimicking robots for industrial, medical or agricultural applications making use of their self-assembling properties and resilience to external influences. in active matter systems, simple sets of rules can lead to many rich phases of collective behaviours. there is ample opportunity to develop new classes of rules that can give rise to never-before-seen phases, and ultimately provide insights into how to reverse-engineer rules for targeted goals. active matter systems are of particular interest with respect to swarm robotic systems where the behaviour of individual robots is affected by the fluid dynamics of their environment; for example, aerial drones whose position may drift when buffeted by gusts of wind, or surface-water/underwater vessels that may be dragged along by water currents. these swarm robotic systems must coordinate their movement despite the influence of the fluid environment they inhabit. by translating the mechanics of active matter systems to swarm robotic systems, we hope to improve the performance of embodied agents used in real-world applications. this novel approach would be particularly beneficial in gps-denied environments such as deep-sea exploration, where individual robots must remain aggregated without the aid of an external frame of reference. this interdisciplinary project at the interface of physics, computational modelling, and robotics will develop new theoretical and computational models for such systems and validate them on physical robotic swarms. it will broadly consist of three main tasks: - formulating a set of microscopic rules deduced from a set of bio-inspired active matter systems, and formulating a statistical physics description of a large groups of such active matter systems - deriving continuous field models starting from these microscopic rules to describe the collective behaviour of active matter - validating the developed models through their implementation on aerial/surface-water robot swarms ?

is seeking a ph.d.  student with a strong interest in the following research topic: /robot learning task and motion planning of long-horizon (mobile)  manipulation tasks. / the? ph.d. student will work on a highly interdisciplinary topic at the  intersection of machine learning and classical robotics. following the  increasing demand for embodied ai agents that will serve as assistants  in houses, workplaces, etc., we will research how intelligent behavior  may be acquired by the continual purposeful interaction of an agent with  an environment and the induced sensorimotor experience.? our central  research question is ?how can embodied ai systems, specifically mobile  manipulator robots, acquire skills for performing long-horizon assistive  tasks in human-inhabited environments??. as planning for assistive tasks  requires impractical computational time, coupling planning with learning  methods is key to advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of mobile  manipulation. before the introduction of deep reinforcement learning,  learning methods were not able to scale well to high-dimensional  problems, thus prohibiting their use in real-world problems. irosa group  aims to create mobile manipulation robot assistants with the ability to  intelligently acquire their skills, fluently interact with humans  through handover tasks, and dynamically adapt their behavior for  accomplishing long-horizon household tasks, like the  fetch-carry-handover, in human-inhabited environments.? for long-horizon  planning, we will explore ideas from classic task and motion planning,  graph neural networks for combinatorial optimization, hierarchical  reinforcement learning, self-supervised representation learning, etc. students and researchers from the areas of robotics and robotics-related  areas including machine learning, control engineering, and computer  vision are welcome to apply. the candidates are expected to conduct  independent research and at the same time contribute to the research  topics listed above.?

9555,2021,phd opening in robust and control-aware  motion planning," the rainbow team at inria/irisa rennes, france https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!7k3ycutjk308c1-sbovf6oisjiugj58jdnfe01utltzedhsu016v9c8d2z12se-batnlzbck$  is looking for a phd candidate in the topic *robust and control-aware motion planning* *********** context *********** an effective way of dealing with the complexity of robots operating in  real (uncertain) environments is the paradigm of ?feedforward/feedback?  or ?planning/control?: in a first step a suitable nominal trajectory  (feedforward) for the robot states/controls is planned exploiting the  available information (e.g., a model of the robot and of the  environment). this step is usually executed offline and can take into  account presence of constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, limited  actuation) and optimality w.r.t. metrics of interest (e.g., time,  energy). an open-loop execution of this planned trajectory would,  however, fail in most practical cases because of the unavoidable  uncertainties affecting the information used for planning. therefore,  the planned trajectory is in practice robustly executed by making use of  a motion controller that ?closes the loop? (feedback) between planned  and actual motion, providing robustness against all the effects that  could not be considered at the planning stage. while there has been an  effort in proposing ?robust planners? or more ?global controllers?  (e.g., model predictive control (mpc)), a truly unified approach that  fully exploits the techniques of the motion planning and  control/estimation communities is still missing and the existing  state-of-the-art has several important limitations, namely (1) lack of  generality, (2) lack of computational efficiency, and (3) poor  robustness. all these shortcomings are a major limiting factor in the  autonomy and decision-making capabilities of robots operating in all  those complex scenarios (real-world conditions, non-negligible effects  of the uncertainties, fast dynamics) which are instead the typical  conditions in which future robots are expected to operate. in this context, the goal of this phd will be to contribute to the  development of a general and unified ?intrinsically-robust and  control-aware motion planning framework? for addressing the  above-mentioned issues and demonstrating the applicability of this new  framework to real robots in real-world challenging tasks. this phd position is part of a 4-year research project recently funded  by anr (the french funding agency). the project is in cooperation with  the ris team at laas-cnrs and the robotics and mechatronics group at the  univ. of twente, netherlands. *********** phd topic *********** the work will start from our previous contributions where we introduced  the notion of ?closed-loop state sensitivity?

9572,2021,phd position at tu eindhoven on  verifiable estimation and control for autonomous systems," we have a fully funded 4 year long phd position available at the control systems group at tu eindhoven in the netherlands. the aim of this phd project is to develop missing theory and tools towards the goal of having verifiable autonomous control systems that can learn from data. emerging applications in robotics, aerospace and autonomous driving necessitate control systems capable of autonomously performing complex tasks. these control systems need to learn and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. in this phd project, the focus lies on developing the missing theory to enable the formal verification of such autonomous control systems. autonomous driving is a key application area in which theory needs to be developed to improve the verifiability and safety of autonomous control systems. safe driving maneuvers can be expressed as dynamic constraints using temporal logics. these temporal logic specifications combine logical operations with temporal modalities based on constraints over control system's states and outputs and can be automatically verified using formal methods. however, while driving a car, inherent uncertainty is encountered that necessitates the inclusion of learning and estimation strategies. verifying and designing such learning controllers is an open research problem for complex driving maneuvers or control tasks. this project aims to build a framework for the safe and verifiable design of controllers for systems with state and model uncertainty. the objective of the phd research is to exploit advanced system identification and filtering techniques (kalman filtering, bayesian estimation, machine learning) together with control techniques (approximate dynamic programming, lyapunov stability, temporal logics) to improve the resilience of verifiable design methodologies to uncertainty. the research also involves some laboratory work in terms of implementation and validation on small-scale vehicles. for more information see: https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/phd-position-on-verifiable-estimation-and-control-for-autonomous-systems-875257.html__;!!lir3w8kk_xxm!8wmfd8gavnfl1n7vow4n2p5quv6w5bhynwkizgle5t0hmaajgdlsrjt4prkw8z6c7c4jdwna$  dr. ir. sofie haesaert assistant professor tu eindhoven"

in presence of actuation limits and interaction forces what we are looking for: a computer/automation/robotics engineer with a knowledge of robotics fundamentals (kinematics, dynamics, trajectory planning), robot control (motion/interaction control), robotic systems programming (ros or other robotic software framework), mastery of matlab and c++ programming. the candidate should understand the basics of machine learning. previous experience with optimal control (e.g. dynamic programming), planning algorithms (e.g. randomized algorithms), model-less control and model identification is a plus. good mastery of english language is mandatory (at least b2 cefr). general project description: kinematic redundancy is key for optimization of motion and interaction tasks of robotic systems. it is a resource to devise optimal behaviors which often require the robotic system to work in close proximity of kinematic and actuation limits (like in time-optimal control). for non-redundant systems moving in free space, several ad-hoc control paradigms exist, but it is reasonable to assume that more efficient techniques can be designed for redundant systems. the problem becomes even more complex when forces are exchanged between robots and/or with the environment, as when robots physically interact with a jointly manipulated object. we are keen to investigate hybrid optimal control/machine learning solutions to tackle this research issue with a motivated robotics enthusiast. position supervised by: prof. pasquale chiacchio
