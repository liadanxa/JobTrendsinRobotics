student body savouring trondheim city life. with a population of 181.513 (as of october 1st, 2013), it is the third most populous municipality in  norway .  with its snow-capped mountains, deep green valleys and sapphire blue fjords,  norway  is recognized the world over for its scenic beauty. combine that with  norway 's cultural heritage, and you'll find that living in  norway  has something to offer everyone.  while  norway  lies at the very top of europe ? and in fact includes the island archipelago of svalbard, home to the most northerly communities on the planet ? the country's climate is moderated by the gulf stream, and features four distinct seasons.  norway 's natural beauty and a history of famous polar explorers are two reasons why the outdoors is such an important part of norwegian culture. newcomers to  norway  will find the norwegian work culture to be relaxed, but efficient. the typical work week is 37.5 hours long, with a generous summer holiday time and official holidays sprinkled throughout the year. the work culture reflects the culture at large, which is respectful of individual rights and supports a generous welfare system."

and make basic judgments), but also create new relationships among knowledge workers and machines. it is increasingly possible to interact with a machine the way you would with a co-worker. so, instead of assigning a team member to get all information on the performance of a particular product in a specific market or waiting for a request of this kind became a job for the department, a manager or executive could just ask a computer to provide the information. this has the potential to provide more timely access to information and raise the quality and pace of decision-making and therefore performance. if you have any questions, you are welcome !!! ************************************************ dr. luis alberto mu?oz ubando heuristic center chief innovation officer grupo plenum https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__mx.linkedin.com_pub_luis-2dalberto-2dmu&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=t8nlz8aefswj1knqn2qokcpjz2oslru6ovxns7hzpcw&e= ?oz-ubando/4/863/602/ [email]        luisalbertomunozubando at gmail.com [iphone]      +52(1)999.297.3327 [skype]        luisalbertomunozubando [twitter]        https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__twitter.com_albertomunoz&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=djtwa8orxgnxkw15q76eulq89ui5fjqs27vs03_dgr8&e=  [facebook]   https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.facebook.com_luis.alberto.munoz.ubando&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=x15e9uhwarisxczi6tl2mioht7qwrtzbkguox0qbwca&e=  [youtube]     https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.youtube.com_user_luisalbertomunozuban&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=ouomxx3rmmn3yrcuepldowxyi-lpioeyt0pf-oea2lm&e=  [slideshare]  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.slideshare.net_luisalbertomunozubando&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=brt-3czylgbms5v8hdtp_ytoqtioqt1kwk1m2peionc&e=  [e-mail]         alberto.munoz at grupoplenum.com ************************************************ --  ************************************************ dr. luis alberto mu?oz ubando chief innovation officer grupo plenum https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__mx.linkedin.com_pub_luis-2dalberto-2dmu&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=t8nlz8aefswj1knqn2qokcpjz2oslru6ovxns7hzpcw&e= ?oz-ubando/4/863/602/ [email]        luisalbertomunozubando at gmail.com [iphone]      +52(1)999.297.3327 [skype]        luisalbertomunozubando [twitter]        https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__twitter.com_albertomunoz&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=djtwa8orxgnxkw15q76eulq89ui5fjqs27vs03_dgr8&e=  [facebook]   https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.facebook.com_luis.alberto.munoz.ubando&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=x15e9uhwarisxczi6tl2mioht7qwrtzbkguox0qbwca&e=  [youtube]     https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.youtube.com_user_luisalbertomunozuban&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=ouomxx3rmmn3yrcuepldowxyi-lpioeyt0pf-oea2lm&e=  [slideshare]  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.slideshare.net_luisalbertomunozubando&d=cwifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=-s5-lzwbf9x_hl3xnvy_ig50be2c4h7rypawxfdg1zk&s=brt-3czylgbms5v8hdtp_ytoqtioqt1kwk1m2peionc&e=  [e-mail]         alberto.munoz at grupoplenum.com ************************************************"

 =============================================================================== phd position in robotics and machine learning --------------------------------------------------------------- imperial college london dyson school of design engineering location:	south kensington campus, london, uk start date: 	1st may 2016 (or soon after) duration:	3.5 years closing date:	10 april 2016 fully funded (all tuition fees paid) for uk/eu nationals, with additional stipend: 18,000 gbp per annum while this position is also open to overseas applicants, they will only be funded up to the uk/eu level, and will be expected to provide self-funding for the remaining tuition fees. phd research topic -------------------------- the foundations of robotics and robot control were established at a time when there was very limited computational power available. therefore, the robots' design and control algorithms were simplified to extreme. nowadays, we have at our disposal huge computational resources, but we still continue building and controlling robots based on the old concepts. for example, the assumption that the robot links are rigid bodies and that the pose of the end-effector can be calculated through simple forward kinematics by measuring the joint angles is still standard. such assumptions lead to bulky and heavy robots because the links must be designed not to bend during operation. even series-elastic actuation relies on the same assumption of rigid links. the goal of this phd research project is to investigate a radically new approach for controlling robots based on machine learning. instead of using hand-made analytic models of a robot, the robot will learn its own model. machine learning, including deep learning and reinforcement learning can be used to autonomously learn forward and inverse models of a robot's kinematics and dynamics. computer vision can be used to provide perception for both the environment and the robot's own body. the ultimate goal would be the creation of a plug-and-play controller that works without any prior knowledge of the robot. such a solution offers tremendous potential to revolutionize the way we design and control robots, and to significantly expand their capabilities. for example, the robot links will no longer need to be so stiff, and the kinematics will no longer need to be fixed. as an illustration, imagine a lightweight prosthetic arm or a robot exoskeleton that can grow, bend, and adapt to accommodate its patient. such a device would be impossible to control with the existing control methods. another example is flexible use of tools, where the robot easily adapts its controller to use any new tool by online learning of the combined arm-plus-tool kinodynamics. further applications are envisioned to soft robots (e.g. elephant trunk like robots) which are difficult to control with conventional approaches. this research has the potential to lead to re-thinking of the established robot design paradigm (stiff links, fixed kinematics), since robot design and control are tightly coupled: the way we control robots determines the way we design them, and vice versa. novel robot designs will be sought that leverage the rise of affordable 3d printing and novel smart materials, and could lead to the development of hybrid soft-hard robots, modular and reconfigurable robots (evolving hardware), self-repairing and self-improving robots, etc. funding ------------ the funding for this phd position is provided by dyson ltd. their focus is on forward-looking research in robot perception and control with the goal of developing the breakthrough technology which will lie at the heart of new categories of robotic products for the home and beyond. potential applications for the developed research will be sought in close collaboration with dyson's robotics research group. supervision ---------------- the phd student will be supervised by dr petar kormushev at the dyson school of design engineering, with possible co-supervision from the dyson robotics lab at imperial's department of computing. workplace -------------- the dyson school of design engineering is the 10th and newest

design engineering (ide) programme run jointly by imperial and the royal college of art. the school has a fast growing population of both staff and students. it is located at the south kensington campus of imperial, right next to hyde park. requirements -------------------- - you must have an meng or msc degree (or equivalent experience and/or qualifications) in an area pertinent to the

 phd research topic -------------------------- the foundations of robotics and robot control were established at a time when there was very limited computational power available. therefore, the robots' design and control algorithms were simplified to extreme. nowadays, we have at our disposal huge computational resources, but we still continue building and controlling robots based on the old concepts. for example, the assumption that the robot links are rigid bodies and that the pose of the end-effector can be calculated through simple forward kinematics by measuring the joint angles is still standard. such assumptions lead to bulky and heavy robots because the links must be designed not to bend during operation. even series-elastic actuation relies on the same assumption of rigid links. the goal of this phd research project is to investigate a radically new approach for controlling robots based on machine learning. instead of using hand-made analytic models of a robot, the robot will learn its own model. machine learning, including deep learning and reinforcement learning can be used to autonomously learn forward and inverse models of a robot's kinematics and dynamics. computer vision can be used to provide perception for both the environment and the robot's own body. the ultimate goal would be the creation of a plug-and-play controller that works without any prior knowledge of the robot. such a solution offers tremendous potential to revolutionize the way we design and control robots, and to significantly expand their capabilities. for example, the robot links will no longer need to be so stiff, and the kinematics will no longer need to be fixed. as an illustration, imagine a lightweight prosthetic arm or a robot exoskeleton that can grow, bend, and adapt to accommodate its patient. such a device would be impossible to control with the existing control methods. another example is flexible use of tools, where the robot easily adapts its controller to use any new tool by online learning of the combined arm-plus-tool kinodynamics. further applications are envisioned to soft robots (e.g. elephant trunk like robots) which are difficult to control with conventional approaches. this research has the potential to lead to re-thinking of the established robot design paradigm (stiff links, fixed kinematics), since robot design and control are tightly coupled: the way we control robots determines the way we design them, and vice versa. novel robot designs will be sought that leverage the rise of affordable 3d printing and novel smart materials, and could lead to the development of hybrid soft-hard robots, modular and reconfigurable robots (evolving hardware), self-repairing and self-improving robots, etc. funding ------------ the funding for this phd position is provided by dyson ltd. their focus is on forward-looking research in robot perception and control with the goal of developing the breakthrough technology which will lie at the heart of new categories of robotic products for the home and beyond. potential applications for the developed research will be sought in close collaboration with dyson's robotics research group.

theme 1: sensing humans: enhancing social abilities of the icub platform description: there is general consensus that robots in the future will work in close interaction with humans.  this requires that robots are endowed with the ability to detect humans and interact with them. however, treating humans as simple animated entities is not enough: meaningful human-robot interaction entails the ability to interpret social cues. the aim of this project is to endow the icub with a fundamental layer of capabilities for detecting humans, their posture and social behaviour. examples could be the ability to detect if a person is attempting to interact with the robot and to react accordingly. this requires a new set of computational tools based on computer vision and machine learning to detect people at close distance. this ""face-to-face"" scenario requires developing novel algorithms for coping with situations in which large areas of the body are occluded or only partially visible. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and visual geometry and modelling lab (pavis department). the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and alessio del bue (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 2: scene analysis using deep-learning description: machine learning, and in particular deep learning methods, have been applied with remarkable success to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques is that training requires a large amount of data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by a robot. one solution is to adopt pre-trained convolutional neural networks (dcnn) for image representation and use simpler classifiers, either in batch or incrementally. following this approach dcnns have been integrated in the icub visual system leading to a remarkable increase of object recognition performance. however, scene analysis in realistic settings is still challenging due to scale, light variability and clutter. the goal of this project is to further investigate and improve the icub recognition and visual segmentation capabilities. to this aim we will investigate techniques for pixel-base semantic segmentation using dcnns and object detection mixing top-down and bottom-up cues for image segmentation. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 3: implicit learning description: machine learning, and in particular deep learning  methods, have been applied with remarkable success to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques it that training requires a large amount of labelled data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by the robot. critical issues are how to obtain large amount of training samples, how to perform object segmentation and labelling. they key idea is develop weakly supervised frameworks, where learning can exploit forms of implicit labelling.  in previous work we have proposed to exploit coherence between perceived motion and the robot own-motion to autonomously learn a visual detector of the hand. the goal of this project is to investigate algorithms for learning to recognize object by exploiting implicit supervision, focusing in particular on the strategies that allow the robot to extract training samples autonomously, starting from motion and disparity cues. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme4: learning to recognize objects using multimodal cues description: robots can actively sense the environment using not only vision but also haptic information. one of the problems to be addressed in this case is how to control the robot to explore the environment and extract relevant information (so called exploratory procedures). conventionally, learning to recognize objects has been primarily addressed using vision. however, physical properties of objects are more directly perceived using other sensory modalities. for this reason, recent work has started to investigate how to discriminate objects using other sensory channels, like touch, force and proprioception. the goals of this project are i) to implement control strategies for object exploration, investigating to what extent different explorative strategies contribute to object discrimination, ii) the implementation of learning algorithms that allow the robot to discriminate objects using haptic information and, finally, iii) to investigate how haptic information can be integrated with vision to build a rich model of the objects for better discrimination. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale and lorenzo rosasco (name.surname at iit.it) # theme 5: model driven software development in robotics description: humanoid robots are evolving at rapid pace, thanks to impressive progress in mechatronics and algorithms supporting cognitive capabilities for perception, control and planning.  proper integration of such capabilities require not only an adequate software infrastructure but also adoption of sound software engineering methodologies. research on software engineering for robotics has primarily focused component based approaches and middleware technologies (ros, yarp, orocos to mention just a few). model driven engineering is widely adopted to design complex systems in other fields but has received comparatively little attention in robotics. however, adoption of model driven approaches to the development of software systems lead to increase quality and code reuse. the goal of this project is to survey existing techniques for modeling distributed component-based robotic software systems and to develop a model-driven engineering toolkit for the icub system. the new toolkit should support the system engineer in designing, configuring, and analyzing relevant properties of control applications for the icub system.  requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility), in collaboration with the robotics laboratory of the university of bergamo. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) with a background in software engineering and, possibly, robotics. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. contacts: lorenzo natale (name.surname at iit.it) and davide brugali (name.surname at unibg.it) -- istituto italiano di tecnologia lorenzo natale, phd lorenzo.natale at iit.it via morego, 30 16163 genova ph: +39 010 71781946 fax: +39 010 7170205 https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__lornat75.github.io&d=cwifag&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=i9wc-2hrg-n7n6dbhhlofna2rt8ezm0fpwignvsraz8&s=qhyiry7d8635mly6rfkaauw3ahooonk9lxfnbwtsrvu&e=  www.iit.it"

autonomously by a robot. one solution is to adopt pre-trained convolutional neural networks (dcnn) for image representation and use simpler classifiers, either in batch or incrementally. following this approach dcnns have been integrated in the icub visual system leading to a remarkable increase of object recognition performance. however, scene analysis in realistic settings is still challenging due to scale, light variability and clutter. the goal of this project is to further investigate and improve the icub recognition and visual segmentation capabilities. to this aim we will investigate techniques for pixel-base semantic segmentation using dcnns and object detection mixing top-down and bottom-up cues for image segmentation. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and possibly in computer vision. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong computer programming skills. references: olga russakovsky, jia deng, hao su, jonathan krause, sanjeev satheesh, sean ma, zhiheng huang, andrej karpathy, aditya khosla, michael bernstein, alexander c. berg and

to solve visual problems like pedestrian detection, object retrieval, recognition and segmentation. one of the difficulties with these techniques it that training requires a large amount of labelled data and it is not straightforward to adopt them when training samples are acquired online and autonomously by the robot. critical issues are how to obtain large amount of training samples, how to perform object segmentation and labelling. they key idea is develop weakly supervised frameworks, where learning can exploit forms of implicit labelling. in previous work we have proposed to exploit coherence between perceived motion and the robot own-motion to autonomously learn a visual detector of the hand. the goal of this project is to investigate algorithms for learning to recognize object by exploiting implicit supervision, focusing in particular on the strategies that allow the robot to extract training samples autonomously, starting from motion and disparity cues. requirements: this

actively sense the environment using not only vision but also haptic information. one of the problems to be addressed in this case is how to control the robot to explore the environment and extract relevant information (so called exploratory procedures). conventionally, learning to recognize objects has been primarily addressed using vision. however, physical properties of objects are more directly perceived using other sensory modalities. for this reason, recent work has started to investigate how to discriminate objects using other sensory channels, like touch, force and proprioception. the goals of this project are i) to implement control strategies for object exploration, investigating to what extent different explorative strategies contribute to object discrimination, ii) the implementation of learning algorithms that allow the robot to discriminate objects using haptic information and, finally, iii) to investigate how haptic information can be integrated with vision to build a rich model of the objects for better discrimination. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the humanoid sensing and perception lab (icub facility) and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and

description: machine learning methods have been applied with remarkable success to solve a variety of perceptual/cognitive tasks, e.g. in vision and speech. yet, current state of the art algorithms are challenged by increasing amount of high-dimensional data, possibly evolving over time. the goal of this project is to tackle the design and deployment of sound machine learning methods to learn from large/huge scale data sets possibly acquired over time in changing conditions. this problem finds natural application in the context of humanoid robotics where data are constantly made available by sensory systems. the plan is to first consider extensions of classical convex approaches such as kernel methods, by incorporating ideas such as sketching, hashing and randomization. the idea is then to further explore possibly non-convex, hierarchical (deep) learning methods, based on greedy optimization strategy. emphasis will be on developing effective solutions, while keeping optimal theoretical guarantees. requirements: this phd project will be carried out within the icub facility and laboratory for computational and statistical learning. the ideal candidate should have a degree in computer science or engineering (or equivalent) and background in machine learning, robotics and in optimization/signal processing. he should also be highly motivated to work on a robotic platform and have strong mathematical and or/ computer programming skills. references: incremental semiparametric inverse dynamics learning, raffaello camoriano, silvio traversaro, lorenzo rosasco, giorgio

clopema: www.clopema.eu; rasoroso). requirements:applicants are expected to have a strong motivation for at least one of the following key topics in robotics: robot control, robot programming, mechatronics. furthermore, good attitude for experimental work is mandatory. the candidates must have: very good programming skills with different languages (including c/c++, python, matlab/simulink); confidence with electronic hardware and be capable to conduct experiments; attitude to problem solving, and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 2:tactile sensing technologies and perception description:tactile sensing is one key topic for the development of future robots capable of complex interaction with humans and objects. design of tactile sensors as well as tactile based sensing, perception and control are challenging research topics and university of genova has gained a solid reputation in this area in the past few years, and has been involved in important international research projects related to this topic (roboskin: www.roboskin.eu; clopema: www.clopema.eu). tactile data convey information about the characteristics of the contact between the robot and the manipulated objects. this information is fundamental to proper control the grasping and manipulation; furthermore, controlled manipulation can in turn be used to extract further information useful to recognize and classify objects and contacts. the objective of the phd topic is to investigate techniques and methodologies for tactile data sensing, perception and interpretation. furthermore, since tactile data are generated by active manipulation control another objective is the study of the mechanisms relating tactile based feedback robot control and tactile data perception. requirements:applicants are expected to have strong background and experience in at least one of the following topics: robot control, machine learning, system identification. the candidates must have: very good programming skills with different languages (including c/c++, matlab/simulink); experience with electronic hardware; be capable to conduct experiments and be strongly motivated to team working. contacts: giorgio cannata <mailto: giorgio.cannata at unige.it> => theme 3:a study about how humans perceive robots in interaction processes description:human-robot interaction is expected to play a significant role in the near future. as soon as robots will be employed in environments and for tasks requiring them to be in close contact with humans, the implications of their behaviours on human attitudes, emotions and feelings (eventually, behaviour) cannot be underestimated. we are interested in assessing and measuring the effects of controlled robot behaviours on humans, specifically in all those aspects constituting what in cognitive psychology is termed non-verbal behaviour (e.g., gestures and their parameters, head motions, gaze), while humans and robots are engaged in a collaborative activity. in fact, literature suggests that humans can be greatly influenced (at the subconscious level) by environmental and human factors, and their actions be dependent on perceptions they do not even conceptualise. the phd proposal has two main objectives: on the one hand, design, investigate and assess methods to adapt experimental protocols borrowed from behavioural and cognitive psychology to understand how human behaviour can be influenced by robot behaviour, and how humans interpret it; on the other hand, synthetize robot behaviours which take human expectations into account, and convey a specific (non-verbal) message as humans would do. to this aim, the student will have also to encode specific sensorimotor skills, which will be mediated by insights in cognitive and behavioural psychology. such skills will have to be part of a robot behavioural architecture able to allow for advanced forms of cognitive human-robot interaction. the experimental assessment will be conducted using a baxter dual-arm manipulator in the context of human-robot interaction processes, e.g., object handovers. the project will be conducted in cooperation with university college london (uk), the national institute of informatics and keio university (both in japan). requirements:ontology-based and probabilistic knowledge representation techniques. software development in c/c++. problem-solving and experimental attitude. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 4:the use of language to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning in human-robot interaction tasks description:according to the cognitive perspective on language development and evolution in humans, the language faculty plays a decisive role in the development of both rational thought and reasoning. such an approach criticises the classical paradigm which views language as a communication capability derived from thought and its basic rules as a by product, i.e., the chomsky?s notion of universal grammar. if the cognitive perspective has some degree of plausibility, then the implications in human-robot interaction scenarios can be particularly important. the main objective of this phd proposal is to investigate methods to bootstrap robot?s knowledge and reasoning capabilities by means of a dialogue-based human-robot interaction process. we aim at a scenario where a human teaches a robot about objects, their properties and mutual configurations, using both demonstration and dialogue. the robot must be able to ground sensory perceptions (e.g., visual or haptic) with the syntax and semantic clues uttered by the human during the dialogue. using the acquired knowledge, the robot will be therefore able to manipulate objects on the basis of human-provided instructions. the knowledge acquired by the robot through the human-robot interaction process and the reasoning schema are going to be represented using models whose structures are borrowed from recent studies in behavioural psychology: the student will evaluate and use such conceptual tools as probabilistic ontologies to ground knowledge expressed using the bayesian theory of subjective probability, the dempster-shafer theory and its extensions, e.g., the transferable belief model, which are typically used to manage inconsistences. the student will test and assess the developed models in a human-robot interaction scenario where a baxter dual-arm manipulator will reason upon subjective spatial knowledge. the study will involve also joint work with the japan advanced institute of science and technology (jaist), as well as interdisciplinary work with experts in computational linguistics. requirements:basic knowledge in statistics and probability theory. knowledge representation and reasoning. software development in c/c++. contacts: fulvio mastrogiovanni <mailto: fulvio.mastrogiovanni at unige.it> => theme 5:approximate methods for active identification description:the research will focus on system identification methods with particular attention to the role of the control action to improve (on line) the performance in terms of identification accuracy over a finite time or time. as for the system model, the so-called ?black box? paradigm will be addressed. no specific structure for the system to be identified will be assumed. the use of parametrized approximation structures will be addressed whose complexity could be tuned a priori in order to reach a suitable trade-off between model accuracy and online computational requirement. the parameters of the approximating structure will be tuned on line, when the control action will be used in order to improve the achieved model accuracy. different control methods will be addressed, based on parameterization of the control laws as well as on approximate optimization methods. requirements:system identification. machine learning. optimal control. contacts: marco baglietto <mailto: marco.baglietto at unige.it> => theme 6:cooperative robotics for the smart factory description:the application of robots within manufacturing industries dates back form the seventies and now represents a well-consolidated field of application. most of its successes could however be achieved by exploiting the possibility of generally having the robot working within well structured environments, even if rigid and therefore very much lacking of flexibility, where very many, if not all, of the robot operations could be planned in advance in their very details; and then executed with the required precision levels. accordingly with the horizon 2020 strategic research agenda (sra) and related multi annual roadmap (mra) (but see also the recently launched european challenge euroc) all a set of challenges for the future factories have been therefore foreseen, also including the following important topics, by the way also addressing the specific needs of sme manufacturers: - cost effectiveness at low lot sizes, - intuitive to be used, - easily adaptable to a wide variety of application tasks, - easily reconfigurable modular kinematic structures, - modular kinematic structures intrinsically exhibiting self-organizing properties (in terms of their reconfiguration and relevant motion control), - exhibiting cooperation capabilities (with other robotic agents, as well as with humans during manipulation, assembly, transportation, etc.). the proposed phd program will address the last four of the above listed topics, by basing the activities concerning real time control and adaptation of the involved structures (mainly the self organization of modular robotic structures and cooperation capabilities) on some recent research results; clearly indicating the possibility of managing the mentioned topics within the same uniform, distributed and even decentralized, real time functional and algorithmic architectures. progresses in this direction are therefore expected as outputs of the phd program; to be then experimented, for some typical manufacturing problems, within a strict integration with the higher levels of planning, decision and command, whose shift toward more abstract and simplified symbolic representation should actually be allowed, in the light of the expected real time control and adaptation results. to the above aims the phd program will exploit different hardware resources for its experimental results; namely a crawler mobile manipulator for outdoor environments, two youbot platforms and a baxter bi-manual robotic system. requirements:mechatronics. multi-body kinematics and dynamicstheory. robotics. the candidates must also have: strong programming skills (c/c++, matlab/simulink);

performing it and learning its motor and sensory consequences.  the general aim of this project will be to provide the humanoid robot icub with a similar visuo-motor matching skill in order to endow it with a human-like ability to understand human actions. in particular the robot will have to learn the motor (efference copy) and sensory (visual, joint angles, forces) consequences of its own actions to build a complete action representation. the research should determine which are the visual information needed to allow the recall of this model when the robot observes the same action performed by someone else. the work might take advantage of a computational system already available on the robot designed to localize the portion of the scene containing biological motion and extract some of its visual features .  the successful candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes.  requirements:?

these multisensory cues. the research will leverage on the current social capabilities of the robot icub, as gaze tracking,? biological motion detection, biologically plausible motion generation, etc.?

3957,2016,phd position in control of parallel 	robots," ""please forward this email to anyone who might be interested"" the lirmm at cnrs/university of montpellier is looking for graduate students interested in pursuing a phd degree in control and robotics with focus on control of parallel robots. description : parallel kinematic manipulators (pkms) have gained an increased  popularity in the last few decades. this interest has been stimulated by  the significant advantages of pkms compared to their traditional serial  counterparts, with respect to some specific industrial tasks requiring  high accelerations and accuracy. however, to fully exploit their  potential and to get the most of their capabilities, a long path is  still to be covered. in addition to mechanical design, calibration and  optimization of the structure, efficient control development plays an  essential role in improving the overall performance of pkms. however, most of the proposed control schemes in the literature are  often inspired from those of their serial counterparts, while neglecting  friction, actuators dynamics, transmission and motor drivers. the objective of this thesis is to look for the necessary tools to  improve the performance of parallel robots, in terms of precision,  motion speed and robustness. in this framework, we wish to propose a new formulation that allows  estimating and compensating errors coming from: -motor drivers, -actuators dynamics, -transmission system, -friction in the articulations. indeed, it should be a technological feat, which relies on recent  advances in automatic control and robotics. the study will start first  on one articulation of the robot, and then it will be generalized to the  case of the whole robot with the complete chain including motor drivers,  actuators, transmission system and the articulations. however, such a solution will not be trivial, since pkms are known for  their highly nonlinear dynamics which increases considerably when  operating at high accelerations, often leading to mechanical vibrations.  moreover, uncertainties are abundant in such systems due to model  simplifications, the wear of the components of the robot and the  variations of the environment. furthermore, their highly coupled dynamics, singularities and actuation  redundancy in some mechanisms give rise to very complex and challenging  control issues. consequently, the developed control schemes should take  into account all the previously mentioned issues and challenges. to this end, estimation and identification techniques (online and  offline) will be proposed in this study and integrated in a new global  formulation relying on adaptive control strategies. the proposed formulation will be first validated in numerical  simulations, then through real-time experiments on different available  pkms at lirmm. two case studies will be performed: non-redundant pkms (case of veloce  and adept quattro robots), and the redundantly actuated pkms (case of r4  and arrow robots). real-time experiments will be performed in different operating  conditions (nominal case, external disturbances rejection, robustness  towards uncertainties, change of operating conditions, etc) to show the  effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution in terms of global  performances of the parallel robot.    *requirement:*candidates should have a master degree (or equivalent) in  automatic control, robotics, or a closely related area, preferably with  a focus in automatic control and robotics. he/she is expected to have  good skills in control and robotics as well as in simulation and  programming (matlab/simulink, c/c++, etc). a background in parallel  robotics would be appreciated. *thesis beginning:*1^st of october 2016 for 3 years. *laboratory: *lirmm umr cnrs/university of montpellier, france. *how to apply?: *interested applicants should send a motivation letter,  a detailed cv, current transcript and recommendation letters to: ahmed.chemori at lirmm.fr and through the doctoral school i2s website (link ?phd proposals?) https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.edi2s.univ-2dmontp2.fr_&d=dqifaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=mzasgxozmn5gx9rhctumwllmtgthnuygvs9ot7pje5o&s=ejbf2ee0gqdbgmmbqzr3nacwlct0epnwcsiauvtau5c&e=  kind regards a. chemori --  -------------------------------------- dr. ahmed chemori cnrs researcher universit?

4010,2016,phd position in medical microrobotics  at lirmm (montpellier) and icube (strasbourg) france," applications are invited for a fully funded phd position (36 months) in  medical microrobotics in france. students with a strong background in mechanical engineering, compliant  mechanisms or microrobotics are encouraged to apply. topic ------- microrobotic systems for diagnosis and gastrointestinal therapies context ----------- since the appearance of the first endoscopic capsules for the  observation of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, a lot of work has been  done to increase the performance of these devices by giving them new  functions [1].  initially as mere inert capsules, these systems have  evolved gradually into real micro-robots with new functions as  locomotion and in situ intervention (drug delivery, biopsies, sample  extraction, etc.). however, the fabricated prototypes are generally  designed by miniaturization of mechanical principles initially thought  for conventional-size robots, which leads to major difficulties in  clinical operations. the recent development of 3d printing processes  using biocompatible materials and progresses in microrobotics and  micro-mechanisms based on flexible structures allow considering the  development of new approaches for the design of micro-robots transiting  through or staying inside the digestive tract with a major objective:  clinical application on a large scale and at low cost. for this purpose, the lirmm (laboratoire d'informatique, de robotique et  de micro?lectronique de montpellier - umr cnrs 5506) and icube  (laboratoire des sciences de l'ing?nieur, de l'informatique et de  l'imagerie - umr 7357) propose this phd position. these two laboratories  are recognized in the field of medical robotics and in the design of  robots, and offer this thesis in the labex cami  context (computer  assisted medical interventions). the aim is to develop a new generation  of microrobots exploiting the possibilities of biocompatible additive  manufacturing (3d printing) to design and implement micro-robots based  on flexible structures for applications in diagnostic and  gastrointestinal therapies, designed in partnership with the laboratory  timc-imag (techniques de l?ing?nierie m?dicale et de la complexit? ?  informatique, math?matiques et applications de grenoble, umr cnrs 5525). ph.d. objectives ---------------------- the objectives are to study and develop new robotic solutions at the  centimeter scale to propose devices with mobility capabilities, in order  to perform motion in the gi tract, and also to perform tasks such as  delivery of active substance, sample collection, and more generally to  contribute to the diagnostic and treatment of digestive pathologies. technological developments will be mainly based on the use of 3d  printing techniques for the manufacturing of biocompatible flexible  structures. current additive manufacturing techniques offer a large  freedom in the design and they constitute a solid basis for building  miniaturized devices with a bottom-up strategy, instead of a classical  top-down process. in this latter case, robotic solutions are elaborated  from well-known solutions at the macro scale. this can be a strong  limitation with assembly or friction issues that are not encountered  with solutions developed initially at the micro scale, on which we will  rely. in other words, we intend to use design principles issued from  micro and nano robotics to develop at a meso scale robotic devices that  can be exploited in the gi tract environment and that are able to  generate sufficient forces and displacements. for this ph.d. work, the student will benefit from the expertise of the  advisors in the field of compliant mechanisms, robotic systems,  microrobotics and in medical robotics. a whole set of experimental  facilities will be available within the dexter group at lirmm and avr  group at icube, as well as apparatuses from timc-imag. the three groups  also have close interactions with the medical environment. work program -------------------- the ph.d. work will take place in montpellier and strasbourg, two very  attractive cities, at lirmm and icube, two outstanding research  environments for the development of such medical microrobots. mobility  during the 3-year program will be needed in order to develop the ph.d.  project. in a general way, the foreseen work program can be described in the  following way: -          state of art on gi robotics -          study of the gi environment and selection of relevant tasks  for the applicative context -          assessment of biocompatible 3d printing processes -          elaboration of mechanical concepts based on compliant  mechanisms for the design of meso robots -          design, integration and evaluation of new flexible structures -          design, integration and evaluation of new microrobots -          experimental assessment in lab conditions -          preclinical trials, depending on the performances obtained  during lab evaluation the time spent in montpellier and strasbourg will be defined after  discussion with the ph.d. applicant, the goal being to optimize the  interactions with scientific experts and the use of experimental  facilities on the two sites. during the 3 years,  montpellier-strasbourg-montpellier or strasbourg-montpellier sequences  can for instance be considered. applicant profile ---------------------- the ph.d. applicant needs to have a mechanical engineering or  mechatronics background. he/she will hold a m.sc.in one of these fields,  or an equivalent diploma (engineer degree). skills in the medical  robotics/compliant mechanisms would be a plus. expected beginning -------------------------- beginning of the ph.d. thesis is expected in october 2016 for 36 months. advisors ------------ yassine haddab professor, university of montpellier lirmm - umr 5506 - cc 477 161 rue ada, f-34095 montpellier cedex 5 france e-mail: yassine.haddab at lirmm.fr t?l. : +33 4 67 41 85 57 pierre renaud professor, insa strasbourg avr ?

intervention program to increase physical activity of older adults and promote fall prevention, while motivating the users through captivating and challenging multi-player exergames. the user will be able to choose the type of exercise that suits him/her best from sequences of games composed together to create workouts, dance exercises based on traditional dances from different european countries or tai chi training, all with social capabilities to foster community engagement and enhance cultural and cognitive aspects. all exercises will be monitored using available motion sensors, with special focus on inertial sensors, therefore allowing and promoting the use of the smartphone as the main sensor. the use of other common sensors, like kinect, will also be considered. the project will also include the development of a specially designed sensor featuring an imu that can be attached to specific parts of the body to allow proper and accurate tracking of all body movements. the use of multiple sensors simultaneously may also be considered for a better evaluation of body movement. these imus, being cheap and easy to use, will be provided whenever there is no possibility to use any other sensor. 2. notre ------------- the vision of notre is to develop a network that will strengthen and enhance the potential of the newly established social computing research centre (scrc) at the cyprus university of technology (cut) for stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in the area of social aspects of computing. notre proposes an interdisciplinary approach towards the close network collaboration between scrc of cut, a research active university in a low-performing member state, and four internationally-leading counterparts specializing in: (a) online social networks and their analysis; (b) entertainment, games, virtual reality and educational technologies; (c) social computing for social inclusion; and (d) social computing and social change. scrc through this proposal does not only aim to access the core research groups of the leading counterparts, and their collaborators, but also recognizes the multidisciplinarity of the field and will try to establish itself as an intermediate between them. the notre network will follow a series of interlinked activities, such as short term staff exchanges, expert visits and short-term on-site training, workshops, conference attendance, organization of joint summer school type activities, and dissemination and outreach activities. such activities with world-renowned eu partners (imdea; miralab of universite de geneve; institute of computer science of the foundation for research and technology hellas -forth-ics; and the department of political science of the university of dusseldorf -udus), will be instrumental for significantly strengthening scrc's research efforts, enhancing the network's innovation capacity and research profile, and stimulating scientific excellence in the emerging multidisciplinary field of social computing. university of geneva ====================== the university of geneva is a public research university located in geneva, switzerland. it was founded in 1559 by john calvin, as a theological seminary and law school. it remained focused on theology until the 17th century, when it became a center for enlightenment scholarship. in 1873, it dropped its religious affiliations and became officially secular. today, the university is the second-largest university in switzerland by number of students. in 2009, the university of geneva celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding. at least 40% of the students come from foreign countries. unige is a member of the league of european research universities (including academic institutions such as amsterdam, cambridge, heidelberg, helsinki and milan) the coimbra group and the european university association. geneva, switzerland ===================== geneva is the second most populous city in switzerland (after z?rich). geneva is a global city, a financial center, and worldwide center for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many of the agencies of the united nations and the red cross. geneva is the city that hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world. it is also the place where the geneva conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war. best regards, simon senecal marie curie early stage researcher e.u. fp7

 robotics is a rapidly evolving technology that allows for fast, low-risk  and low-cost tasks with a worldwide market of over 80 billion dollars  over the next few years. in particular, aerial robots, also known as  drones, provide a breakthrough to easily image and access all sorts of  terrains and situations and are useful for instance in surveillance and  forensics, emergency industrial inspection or a search and rescue  operation. a major difficulty for their global acceptance is the  difficulty for controlling their flight and interacting with them. indeed, aerial robots are generally operated using a (central) ground  station which is not compatible with the time pressure required by  emergency conditions, for instance when rescuing a person out of reach with the ground station. this phd project  aims at concealing such obstacles and construct an aerial robot which is  able to be autonomously and interactively controlled by simple human  gestures, for instance that of a rescuer. the main scientific challenges  are (i) to embed in the aerial robot all the electronics for the visual  system from the retina to the control signals to the propellers, (ii) to  very quickly recognize a variety of simple gestures on-board using a  neuromimetic architecture and (iii) to make the robot react in real time  to these gestures. as such, this project is inter-disciplinary by  positively combining advanced algorithms from event-based bio-inspired  computer vision and the latest technology in aerial robots. first, the project will aim at using bio-inspired methods to remove the  three mentioned obstacles. biological vision, contrary to conventional  processing, is not using frame-based information or clock-based  processing. indeed, it is computationally more efficient to take full  advantage of the dynamic nature of the visual scene: biological vision  is relying on neurones working in parallel networks and coding the  spatio-temporal information of the visual scene into asynchronous spike  trains. thus, biological visual processing, starting at the retina, is  totally asynchronous and event-driven, and their artificial counterparts  can be efficiently modelled [1]. event-based dynamic vision provide a  novel and efficient way for encoding light and its temporal variations  by registering and transmitting only the changes when they occur.  neuromorphic vision sensors mimic biological visual processing by using  an array of interconnected neurons to simulate the neural network [2]  and such systems can output dynamic decision making signals which can be  used to steer the propellers. second, we intend to detect simple human gestures based on the semaphore  system which is based on characteristic hand and body movements. these  are well adapted as they are simple, fast and efficient to categorize  thanks to their unique spatio-temporal signatures. previous authors used  computationally intensive frame-based visual processing and classifiers  to recognize patterns made with different face poses and hand gestures  onboard uavs [3]. differently, we hypothesize that dynamic human  gestures contain characteristic statistics with respect to still images  such that they are more easy to categorize within these neuromimetic  systems. as a consequence, the present phd proposal will provide with a method to  control an aerial robot with hand and body gesture using a bio-inspired  asynchronous electronic architecture. we will first design the  neuromorphic retina able to generate spikes adapted to gesture vision.  then, the phd project will focus on signal processing methods to  identify human presence and associate efficiently series of spikes to  its body movement. the electronic architecture processing the visual  signals will be strongly inspired by the architecture of neural  networks, and therefore will be preferably using clock-less  microcontrollers (such as the verilog-based tiempo clockless 16-bit  microcontroller) or at least an asynchronous computational unit (such as  fpga). an algorithm will then transform the perceived body movement into  control order to the aerial robot. last but not least, experimental  studies will be conducted using the mocap vicon system inside the  marseilles? flying arena.

is approaching: july the 4th, 2016 experiment description: robotics is expected to play a major role in the agricultural domain, and often multi-robot systems and collaborative approaches are mentioned as potential solutions to improve efficiency and system robustness. among the multi-robot approaches, swarm robotics stresses aspects like flexibility, scalability and robustness in solving complex tasks, and is considered very relevant for precision farming and large-scale agricultural applications. however, swarm robotics research is still confined into the lab, and no application in the field is currently available. saga will demonstrate for the first time the application of swarm robotics principles to the agricultural domain. specifically, we target a decentralised monitoring/mapping scenario, and implement a use-case for the detection of volunteer potatoes in sugar beet fields by a group of small unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs). the experiment is founded within the context of the echord++ eu project

the monitoring and mapping problem will be framed in the context of the emergence of a categorisation system within the swarm, so that different categories are associated with different portions of the field. each category features a semantic label that determines the amount of detected weed.  the ideal candidate must demonstrate relevant expertise in swarm robotics, swarm intelligence or in the design of decentralised systems. analytical skills are an asset in order to develop population-level models in support of the design of self-organising behaviours. previous experiences with robotics and uav control are also important, as the candidate will actively participate in deploying the uav swarm for field experiments. salary and working conditions: the research positions lasts for one

before august 25, 2016. suggested phd themes (other creative ideas within the hri2 scopes are welcome!): theme-1: multimodal interfaces for human-robot co-manipulation (tutors: dr. luka peternel and dr. arash ajoudani) physical human-robot interaction and cooperation are two fundamental and necessary aspects for integrating robots into our daily lives. the robots are expected to help us in various tasks, of which many require collaborative effort to be successfully completed. in order to achieve such behaviour, the robot must be able to physically interact with the human counterpart and predict the intentions of the human, despite the additional interaction with the uncertain and unpredictable environment. appropriate robot control methods therefore are essential for the robot to deal with various uncertainties, dynamically aspects and complex task requirements. a promising direction towards this goal is to adaptively regulate mechanical parameters of the robot, based on the task requirements and external feedback. another important aspect of robot control in human-robot interaction/collaboration is the presence of the human. the human behaviour is usually highly unpredictable and difficult to model. indeed recent work at hri2<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_watch-3fv-3de3t5odke6-5fc-26feature-3dyoutu.be&d=dqifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=jolzot_uf25zewxzlbfiu1wy4qcsrlv0vpgftgpi3my&s=tdy558lzxl87khn3vcfyi0k0idiemwmm5z7jxzojrra&e= > laboratory aims at developing appropriate human-robot interfaces to enable the robot to predict or extract the human intention from various feedback modalities (human motor behaviour, vision, interaction force, voice commands, etc.). in addition, other key aspects such as role-allocation in human-robot cooperation and partner's skill evaluation, which can enable the robot to adapt its behaviour to accommodate for different level of competence and capability of the human will be explored. theme-2: design and control principles for power augmentation devices (tutors: dr. wansoo kim and dr. arash ajoudani) exoskeletons are wearable robotic devices that are used for human body power augmentation or rehabilitation. such mechanism could prove indispensable in addressing problems of injuries and growing elderly population. as the exoskeleton is attached to the human body, it is imperative that appropriate control methods and human-robot interfaces are developed to enable coordinated motion and assistance in the complex daily tasks. the main objective in this research line is the development of appropriate control strategies to facilitate the interaction between the human, the power augmentation device and the environment. in addition, hri2 aim at developing novel power augmentation devices, therefore, we highly encourage applications for hardware developments as well. theme-3: shared authority approaches in humanoids control (tutor: dr. arash ajoudani) the need to manipulate objects and tools in unstructured or hostile environments has led to the development of several master-slave teleoperation interfaces: from the most basic, unilateral position-based, to bilateral force-reflecting systems. notwithstanding the widespread use of such frameworks, they are known to lack substantial requirements to render an appropriate interaction performance (e.g. soft interactions in unilateral and stability in the latter). therefore, the main objective of this theme is to address such limitations by the development of novel and intuitive interfaces for the execution of dynamic remote manipulation tasks. our objective is to extend the recent developments at hri2

candidate with strong ambition to apply her/his engineering knowledge to the exciting area of robot-assisted laser microsurgery.     this position will be dedicated to the engineering of mechatronic solutions to bring our robotic laser microsurgery technologies to clinical use. it is a great opportunity to apply your engineering knowledge to the development of very important real-life robotic systems with potential to greatly enhance healthcare.   given the required level of precision and dexterity laser microsurgeries are difficult operations that currently can only be performed by expert surgeons. however, we have shown that robotics can transform and greatly improve this scenario. our robotic systems have already shown that they can help surgeons perform more precise and safer operations, which can lead to better quality surgeries and much better outcomes for the patients. in the current stage we are working with head & neck surgeons and a surgical laser company to create the next generation surgical system for transoral laser microsurgeries. this process involves the refinement and development of new surgical robot prototypes, as well as their evaluation in collaboration with our partner surgeons.    we are seeking to hire an outstanding msc student (or recent graduate) with strong interest in the design, development and control of robotic systems for microsurgical applications to assist in this technology transfer and innovation process. the successful candidate will work in a multidisciplinary team including roboticists, biomedical engineers, interaction researchers and surgeons. she/he will interface with engineers from the company and from iit to translate research results into a commercial surgical system. this will involve customization of current technologies and potentially the development of new robotic systems in collaboration with the laser company.   desired qualifications:  * background in engineering   * experience in the design and development of mechatronic systems   * experience in the implementation and programming of embedded systems  * experience in cad-based mechanical design  * creativity and proactive attitude  * independent and persistent personality  * strong communication and english language skills (both written and spoken) are required.     ================================   internship in robot-assisted cancer detection & treatment systems   the biomedical robotics lab is looking for an international, well-motivated and outstanding internship candidate with strong ambition to pursue a research career.   this position will involve research and development activities related to the topic of robot-assisted cancer detection and treatment. this is a highly important research area given that cancer is a leading cause of mortality today, making the improvement of diagnosis and treatment methods a high priority challenge in healthcare. robots can offer significant assistance to make cancer treatment effective and efficient. they can help surgeons completely eradicate tumors with minimal damage to healthy tissue. for example, in throat cancer surgery robots can enhance surgical precision and allow better preservation of vital functionalities such as breathing, deglutition and vocalization. nevertheless, the vast majority of cancer operations today completely depends on the experience and judgment of the surgeon to define the borders of the tumor and decide how much tissue to excise from the patient. this is a situation we want to improve by increasing the objectivity of surgical decisions. therefore, our group is investing on research and development of new robotic systems able to not only enhance the dexterity of surgeons, but also to detect cancer in real-time, which will allow higher precision surgeries with maximum preservation of healthy tissue.   to assist in this work, we are seeking to hire an outstanding msc student (or recent graduate) with strong interest in biomedical sensors, surgical robotics and systems integration. the successful candidate will work in a multidisciplinary team including roboticists, biomedical engineers, physicists and surgeons. she/he will collect and analyze data from controlled surgical operations on ex-vivo tissue realized with our robot-assisted laser microsurgery system. in addition, she/he will also have the opportunity to use information from the novel cancer sensors to enhance the surgeon's perception and automate the control of the robot for specific surgical tasks.   desired qualifications:  * background in engineering, physics or related discipline  * experience in real-time data acquisition and processing  * experience in machine learning and pattern recognition techniques  * experience interfacing computer systems and technological (e.g. robotic) devices  * creativity and proactive attitude  * independent and persistent personality  * strong communication and english language skills (both written and spoken) are required. _____________________________________ leonardo mattos, phd head of biomedical robotics laboratory   istituto italiano di tecnologia

before august 30, 2016. suggested phd themes (other creative ideas within the hri2 scopes are welcome!): theme-1: multimodal interfaces for human-robot co-manipulation (tutors: dr. luka peternel and dr. arash ajoudani) physical human-robot interaction and cooperation are two fundamental and necessary aspects for integrating robots into our daily lives. the robots are expected to help us in various tasks, of which many require collaborative effort to be successfully completed. in order to achieve such behaviour, the robot must be able to physically interact with the human counterpart and predict the intentions of the human, despite the additional interaction with the uncertain and unpredictable environment. appropriate robot control methods therefore are essential for the robot to deal with various uncertainties, dynamically aspects and complex task requirements. a promising direction towards this goal is to adaptively regulate mechanical parameters of the robot, based on the task requirements and external feedback. another important aspect of robot control in human-robot interaction/collaboration is the presence of the human. the human behaviour is usually highly unpredictable and difficult to model. indeed recent work at hri2<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.youtube.com_watch-3fv-3de3t5odke6-5fc-26feature-3dyoutu.be&d=dqifaw&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rstc00sfv_qvwqlcnmghkrrotmim5rlso-ftzvw2nfnyo&m=lndfq6bmdittidq4hi0did9pytxbdnomodgvyomlr5a&s=g4cbtsmsu6mc2gaghxgf6fjznc0b0h6nzehaiirh1pi&e= > laboratory aims at developing appropriate human-robot interfaces to enable the robot to predict or extract the human intention from various feedback modalities (human motor behaviour, vision, interaction force, voice commands, etc.). in addition, other key aspects such as role-allocation in human-robot cooperation and partner's skill evaluation, which can enable the robot to adapt its behaviour to accommodate for different level of competence and capability of the human will be explored. theme-2: design and control principles for power augmentation devices (tutors: dr. wansoo kim and dr. arash ajoudani) exoskeletons are wearable robotic devices that are used for human body power augmentation or rehabilitation. such mechanism could prove indispensable in addressing problems of injuries and growing elderly population. as the exoskeleton is attached to the human body, it is imperative that appropriate control methods and human-robot interfaces are developed to enable coordinated motion and assistance in the complex daily tasks. the main objective in this research line is the development of appropriate control strategies to facilitate the interaction between the human, the power augmentation device and the environment. in addition, hri2 aim at developing novel power augmentation devices, therefore, we highly encourage applications for hardware developments as well. theme-3: shared authority approaches in humanoids control (tutor: dr. arash ajoudani) the need to manipulate objects and tools in unstructured or hostile environments has led to the development of several master-slave teleoperation interfaces: from the most basic, unilateral position-based, to bilateral force-reflecting systems. notwithstanding the widespread use of such frameworks, they are known to lack substantial requirements to render an appropriate interaction performance (e.g. soft interactions in unilateral and stability in the latter). therefore, the main objective of this theme is to address such limitations by the development of novel and intuitive interfaces for the execution of dynamic remote manipulation tasks. our objective is to extend the recent developments at hri2

de technologie de compi?gne (utc) in france (www.utc.fr/labexms2t). the successful candidate will work with dr. eliseo ferrante on exciting topics at the interface between self-organized artificial life, robotics systems and statistical physics. the postdoc position is expected to start in fall 2016 or later (flexible) and is open until filled. project description: our lab considers self-organizing systems from a unique interdisciplinary point of view that combines artificial life, engineering, statistical physics, and biology.  we study how various biological and technological components can collectively achieve complex dynamics using only simple rules and no centralized control. examples include bird flocks, insect and robot swarms, and bacteria colonies coordinating to achieve collective motion. one of the fundamental challenges of self-organizing systems is the integration of local and global dynamics. while individual components are mainly linked to local sensing and actuation, coherent global responses are required for the organism or group to perform and survive collectively. in order to achieve this collective response, those systems need to have correlations in at least some of their individual state variables that scale up with the system?s size. various processes may provide mechanisms for this coherent collective response. for example, the addition of few long-range interactions is enough to produce integrated dynamics in small-world networks. furthermore, in absence of long-range interactions, systems in a critical state (between order and disorder) naturally display long-range correlations that can achieve coherent system-level dynamics. finally, there could also be other types of interaction modes responsible for reaching coherent collective response. the project undertaken by the candidate will be focused on understanding self-organizing system that must simultaneously manage local and organism-level dynamics. the candidate will study systems in which a collective response is generated at the collective scale, as a function of stimuli that are exerted at the local scale. the candidate will explore whether this property is already present in existing self-organization mechanisms, and potentially develop novel models in which collective response is generated by the interplay between three different mechanisms: small-world topologies, criticality, and self-organization. potential applications include collective exploration and surveillance with technological devices such as drones, which will take advantage of this collective response in order to have a fast reaction to a discovered resource. the candidate will be using tools such as multi-agent simulations and mathematical models to study collective systems with different types of interaction patterns. she or he will focus on scenarios where global and local dynamics needs to be integrated in a group of agents, in order to achieve specific collective goals involving collective response, such as: mapping an unknown environment, achieving collective response to the discovery of a feature in the environment, performing dynamic agent re-allocation in the environment, etc ? in order to do so, the candidate will focus on analyzing the interplay between the different mechanisms able to achieve collective response, in order to find which configuration is best for each scenario. candidate?s profile: the candidate must have earned a doctorate degree in computer science, statistical physics, complex systems, or relevant disciplines, and must be self-motivated and able to work autonomously. the candidate is expected to be proficient in programming languages such as python, java, c++ and to have solid knowledge of scientific software packages such as matlab, r, mathematica. the candidates must have experience with large-scale multi-agent simulations, and familiarity with mathematical modeling of collective systems using several techniques (odes, mean field approximations, chemical reaction networks, fokker-planck equations, langevin equations, etc ?) will definitely be a plus. candidates with an interdisciplinary background that are interested in questions at the interface between science and engineering will be highly preferred. fluent english (written and spoken) is required, and only applications in english will be accepted. above all, the applicants must be motivated, autonomous, and able to learn quickly and work effectively on challenging research problems. documents required to apply: to apply, you can send the following documents to eliseo.ferrante at hds.utc.fr: - curriculum vitae - at least two references and/or recommendation letters - a statement of research experience and interests - publication record stating impact factor (if present) and number of citations for any informal enquiry about the eligibility conditions, as well as for more details about the position, please contact eliseo ferrante <eliseo.ferrante at hds.utc.fr>. --  eliseo ferrante, phd labex ms2t junior research chair joint laboratory heudiasyc labex ms2t umr cnrs 7253 universit?

4282,2016,senior embedded systems / mechatronics  position -- tactical haptics," tactical haptics is seeking a full-time senior embedded systems engineer. tactical haptics is an emerging startup that will change the way that  people physically interact with human-computer interfaces ? starting  with gaming-oriented virtual reality. *senior embedded systems / mechatronics engineer position* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ tactical haptics is seeking an individual with strong hands-on  experience in mechatronics who is a strong embedded firmware programmer  and who has experience with pcb design and integrating microcontrollers  with serial peripherals (we currently use dspic and arm microcontrollers  and develop in c).  experience with haptic devices, control systems  design, mechanisms design, android-to-smart-product app development,  bluetooth low energy, and mechanical design are a plus. *    the ideal candidate will have an ms or phd in electrical or  mechanical engineering (or related program/experience, e.g., robotics or  computer engineering) with a strong academic background in mechatronics  / embedded systems and _8+ years of related industry experience_.  experience in consumer electronics is also desirable. *      if interested, please submit your resume and a cover letter  indicating your relevant experience, as well as your level of interest  and availability, to founder dr. william provancher at  jobs at tacticalhaptics.com. references will also be requested for  candidates that are interviewed. about tactical haptics: -------------------------------- tactical haptics is based in the california bay area and is  commercializing a new form of tactile feedback that can be built into a  video game motion controller and emulate the sensation of force  feedback, without being tethered to a desktop. our controllers currently  integrate with the htc vive, oculus rift, and playstation vr ecosystems,  through the unity and unreal game engines. future products may also  target the mobile vr market (e.g., via an android-based vr headset).      our technology uses sliding plates on the surface of the handle to  apply friction and shear forces to a user?s hand that mimic the forces  naturally experienced when interacting with objects (see above figure  and the videos on our media page: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__tacticalhaptics.com_media_&d=dqidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=gioqvtucsobezza0ygoce73a6traie3vjhc3psmgwba&s=g1oqbmrawurp2ek1ci4jnz8bcf9rtyhuchhitmzhefg&e= ).  because of its ability to recreate the skin sensations of actually  holding and interacting with a real-world object, this type of feedback  creates engaging experiences that bring virtual reality (vr) and gaming  interactions to life. the value and competitive advantage of this  patented technology is that it can portray significantly more engaging  touch feedback than rumble/vibration feedback, yet is less expensive and  has a larger workspace than force feedback devices since a bench-top  robotic linkage is not required to transmit force cues with our  technology.  our haptic device is also simple and intuitive for  developers to program and interact with, as they can use a standard  physics engine (e.g., like available in game development engines) to  estimate force interactions and program our haptic motion controller as  if it is a 3-dimensional force feedback device. see description of position online: ----------------------------------------------- https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__goo.gl_x3uosr&d=dqidaq&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=gioqvtucsobezza0ygoce73a6traie3vjhc3psmgwba&s=k7u7fteladpj1_yf-qstmbtf6cwbmxq_qs0mb_9cri8&e=  thanks, will --  -------------------------------- william provancher, ph.d. founder, tactical haptics palo alto, ca 94304 jobs at tacticalhaptics.com adjunct associate professor university of utah - me department salt lake city, utah 84112 --------------------------------"

 has an open postdoc position for developing active perception schemes  for mobile robots, and for combining them with the concurrent execution  of tasks of interest (e.g., navigation, exploration, coverage, and so on). ********************************************* note: i will be attending iros. please contact me if you would like to  meet me there. ********************************************* *context and roles* one of the main problems in mobile robotics is the need of estimating  some states/parameters of interest during motion exploiting the sensors  available onboard. typical examples are localization for ground robots,  pose/attitude estimation for flying robots, online calibration of sensor  parameters, or more complex tasks such as slam. however, these estimation problems are often nonlinear and, therefore,  the observability properties of the state/parameters to be estimated  strongly depend on the particular trajectory followed by the robot. some  trajectories may be unobservable, while other ones may result in high  information gain. in recent years, an increasing interest has arisen around the problem of  devising active perception schemes in which the robot motion is  optimized offline/online in order to maximize some observability  criterion related to the states/parameters to be estimated. in this context, the postdoc is then expected to address the conception  and implementation of active perception algorithms for quadrotor uavs  with onboard cameras. the main focus will be about the *online*  generation of optimal trajectories with maximum information gain for  addressing, e.g., localization and scene reconstruction. concurrent execution of other tasks of interest may also be considered,  thus creating the need of trading off between task execution and  information gathering during the robot motion. finally, extensions to a multi-uav case will also be part of the  activities, in which the multi-uav group needs to cooperatively estimate  some global property of interest in an optimized (perception-aware) way. *skills* the ideal candidate is expected to have a strong background in control  and/or state estimation theory and, possibly, experience with state  estimation for mobile robotics (ground/flying), and with trajectory  optimization techniques. a ph.d. degree in robotics, computer science, applied mathematics (or  related fields) is required. the candidate must be a proficient user of c/c++ and ros. familiarity  with matlab/simulink, with the quadrotor uav platform, and with  camera-based navigation algorithms are also a plus. scientific  curiosity, large autonomy and ability to work independently are also  expected. finally, a good level of written/spoken english is also required in  order to interact with the rest of the team. *offer* the position is funded for about 1.5 years starting at the earliest. the  candidate will be under the supervision of dr. paolo robuffo giordano  and of dr. paolo salaris

4332,2016,"post-doc position on mechatronics at  laas-cnrs, toulouse, france"," post-doc position on mechatronics at laas-cnrs, toulouse, france designing a prototype of a metastable passive walker. scientific goals: the subject is part of the erc actanthrope project led by jean-paul laumond in the gepetto team at laas-cnrs. actanthrope promotes a neuro-robotics perspective to explore original models of anthropomorphic action. the project targets contributions to humanoid robot autonomy, to advanced human body simulation, and to a new theory of embodied intelligence by promoting a motion based semiotics of the human action. in this frame, the goal of the post-doctoral position is to give an experimental proof of concept on the importance of an actuated head and trunk to passive walkers stabilization. in a previous work [1,2], we have shown in simulation that a controlled head on a passive walker can largely improve the stability (in the sense of poincar?). this is true even on uneven terrain. in a recent work [3], we propose a simulation framework allowing optimizing the physical parameters of a robot implementing the proposed control law. this was achieved thanks to a codesign approach. the next phase is to build the robot. for this we need a talented roboticist able to drive the project from the start to the end of the contract. she/he will be seconded by senior roboticists (including olivier stasse and nicolas mansard) and engineers involved in mechanics and software issues to achieve the goal. the candidate will be supported by the facilities available at laas. responsabilities: - managing the project from the design to the final test of the prototype. - designing and developing the electromechanical part of the robot - implementing the low-level control on the robot - analysis of the in-field experimentation for fixing. qualifications: - phd in mechatronics, electrical or mechanical engineering applied to robotics. - extensive experience with digital signal processing and embedded system development - experience in designing electromechanical systems - experience with rapid prototyping  (e.g. 3d printing, laser cutting, and machining) the position is open for 12 months, which is the deadline for providing the first prototype. an extension period will be considered in case of success. expected starting date is february 1st, 2017. monthly gross salary is fixed by cnrs from 2515? to 3488? according to the applicant experience. how to apply: please email your resume and portfolio with relevant work samples to olivier stasse <ostasse at laas.fr>.

4335,2016,"two fully funded ph.d positions in  social robotics @ aass, orebro university,  sweden "," the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)  at ?rebro university has openings for 2 fully funded  phd  projects (4 years) in social robotics. the phds will specifically be on 1.) social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy and 2.) measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics. the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn). more information on each position and how to apply is provided below. the expected starting date for both phd positions is 1st of april. we want your applications no later than november 30, 2016. for formal inquiry contact: prof. amy loutfi (amy.loutfi at oru.se) research topics ---------------------------- topic 1: social robotic telepresence with sliding autonomy mobile robotic telepresence is used as a social communication aid for older adults, with remote users steering the robot in its environment using feedback from a robot's sensors. for unfamiliar drivers, this often creates a heavy workload and therefore reduces focus on social interaction. one way to reduce the workload is to introduce autonomy to assist the remote user in operating the robot. sliding autonomy is a way to automatically adapt the level of autonomy depending on the current context.the researcher will study how sliding autonomy can be implemented in social robotic telepresence by taking into considerations non-verbal cues as well as social norms. the researcher will also study the effect of sliding autonomy on the workload for operating the robot, and on the associated interaction quality. the researcher will undertake two secondments: (1) an academic secondment to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, to work on interface design for teleoperated robots; (2) an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, germany, to study cost-effective solutions to support sliding autonomy. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2553&rmlang=uk topic 2: measuring interaction effectiveness in social robotics initial studies on mobile robotic telepresence suggest that evaluation using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can lead to a greater understanding of the perceived safety and security. the research goal for this particular position is to test this hypothesis, and to extend the work to include autonomous robot systems operating at varying levels of autonomy, and with varying levels of social behavior. the end result will advance the soa regarding autonomous systems supporting independent living with respect to: (1) the systems? ability to increase the sense of safety and security, (2) the relation between interaction quality, level of autonomy and sense of safety and security, and (3) new quantitative measures that can support qualitative evaluation tools. during a secondment  to ben-gurion university of the negev in beersheba, israel, evaluation procedures will be compared and combined. during an industrial secondment to fraunhofer ipa in stuttgart, alternative approaches to evaluation of social robots will be investigated and compared, possibly leading to modified procedures. further information about this position, the requirements and how to apply can be found at: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3a__www.oru.se_english_working-2dat-2dorebro-2duniversity_jobs-2dand-2dvacancies_-3frm&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=lzkvht9pxz-7m3xjfycpz1hfqza_eb3ci65hfomsab0&e=  page=job&rmjob=2554&rmlang=uk about ?rebro university and aass ----------------------------------------------- ?rebro university is seeking outstanding candidates for two phd positions in computer science at the center of applied autonomous  sensor systems. the centre for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass), carries out multi-disciplinary research environment at ?rebro university in the intersection of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer science. successful applicants will join the aass (applied autonomous sensor systems) research unit (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3a__www.oru.se_aass&d=dqif_w&c=clk7kqutwtaveovigvi0nu5bouhhpn0h8p7csfnc_gi&r=0w3solp5fswiywf2rl6rss8mcefamfepafdtohgtfyi&m=nczkyeigkwf9huchiefz8vfgf7qkdfyyghctwntgu1y&s=b66frycb1clpvv8uaass4d8a5cuxijz2xy1n8fnefow&e= ) at ?rebro university,  sweden . salaries for phd students at ?rebro university are internationally competitive. with over 40 senior researchers and phd students, aass is one of the largest robotics research groups in  sweden . the research and human environment at aass is young and enthusiastic, and phd students come from many different countries and have different scientific and cultural backgrounds. about socrates ------------------------- the recruitment is done as part of socrates (social cognitive robotic agents in the european society), a new marie sk?odowska-curie european training network (etn) comprising  7 universities/research institutes: ume?

ref: 004942 location: wheatley campus, oxford for more information: hr-hrteam-edi at brookes.ac.uk this ia a fixed term position initially for 1 year, renewable for a further 2 years subject to funding the department of computing and communication technologies is seeking to appoint a postdoctoral research assistant in statistical machine learning in the artificial intelligence laboratory, in order to kick-start a new research project on novel robust foundations for machine learning. machine learning algorithms typically focus on fitting a model to the available training data (overfitting), which may lead, for instance, an autonomous driving system to perform well on validation tests but fail catastrophically when tested in the real world (as it has unfortunately been demonstrated of late). common practice in the field contemplates generalisation criteria which are based on a rather na?ve correlation between smoothness and generality. with the deployment of machine learning algorithms in critical ai systems, however, it is crucial to ensure that these algorithms behave predictably in the wild. this raises issues with vapnik's traditional statistical learning theory as a viable foundation for robust machine learning. the remarkable empirical performance achieved so far by deep learning-based approaches, on the other hand, is yet to be matched by a satisfactory understanding of the theoretical basis for their robust behaviour. the successful candidate will take the leadership of a new research programme designed at laying the groundwork for a new, robust paradigm for the foundations of machine learning. a number of research avenues can be envisaged. worst-case, cautious predictions may be generated by solving appropriate mini-max optimisation problems. robust analyses based on convex sets of models (e.g. convex sets of linear boundaries) appear promising. finally, robust bayesian analysis and random set theory may provide the means for a generalisation of the concept of probably approximately correct in statistical learning theory. candidates should have a phd or other postgraduate qualification or be studying for phd in a relevant subject and have significant experience in machine learning, statistics or both. the successful candidate will join a vibrant and ambitious department that is welcoming, supportive and friendly. the department blends excellence in teaching and knowledge transfer with world-leading research in areas that span artificial intelligence, computer vision, cognitive robotics, augmented reality, wireless communications and human machine interfaces. you will be responsible for: the leadership of a new research programme on robust statistical machine learning the implementation and the day-to-day running of other research projects within the artificial intelligence laboratory assisting with the preparation of papers for publication and making presentations at meetings and/or conferences assisting in the preparation of applications for external funding mentoring and supporting other researchers (e.g. phd and msc students or visitors) in the artificial intelligence

automated or not ? and in crowded urban environment, with pedestrians, cyclists and other mobile objects. the av decision-making system will have to cope not only with actual traffic conditions, abide by traffic rules, stop on traffic lights, yield to traffic with higher priority, etc. but also avoid obstacles and correctly react in unusual and unpredicted situations, such as pedestrians suddenly crossing the street or other vehicles abnormal motions. when all vehicles will be automated and connected, such situations will tend to decrease, but deployment of avs will probably be gradual, and there will remain pedestrians on the streets. it is therefore of prime importance that the avs is equipped with a decision-making system that enables it to manage its driving at all times and in all situations.  this thesis proposal is in the framework of the anr avethics project, ?ethics policy for automated vehicle?, granted to vedecom institute, the institute of intelligent systems and robotics (isir) at university pierre and marie curie, and university paris-sorbonne. the focus is the ethical conduct of an automated vehicle during its driving in usual conditions, but also when facing situations wherein it must take decisions involving ethical choices (greenblatt, 2016), i.e., decisions that all have negative consequences, but that have nevertheless to be made.  b. objective: the objective of the current thesis to conduct research in robotics and artificial intelligence to design and validate a decision-making system, which will be used as a research tool to model the properties of an artificial ethics in order to test the interactions of an av with other road users in dilemma situations.  there are several moral theories that try to explain or to guide human decisions (deontic, utilitarian, casuistic ?) that could be applied as such to machine decisions. one of the first tasks of the candidate will be to study moral theories and to become acquainted with their philosophical foundations. simultaneously, literature on machine ethics will be also studied (allen 2006, chauvier 2014), specifically in the context of autonomous vehicles (lin 2015, bonnefon 2015). an artificial moral agent implementing different moral theories as well as casuistic and pragmatic approaches will be then developed and implemented (mclaren 2006). driving is typically in uncertain and evolving conditions. not only perception and interpretation of situations is uncertain, but also actions are not deterministic and their consequences cannot be predicted exactly due for example to vehicle motion (e.g., skidding) or other vehicle reactions. research will therefore explore and implement uncertain representations, e.g., bayesian representations and bayesian networks (ferreira 2013) and decision-making approaches, e.g., markov processes or game theory, in the context of multi-agent systems, in which each agent have partial information, non-identical and maybe conflicting goals and interests, as well as different computational capacities. this is a major objective of the thesis.  the work will also include the development of a simulation environment to study scenarios and situations for characterizing different ethical approaches, and enabling to study human reactions as well. furthermore, the work will investigate how the system could be able to adapt its behavior by learning from user decisions, instead of merely applying its own policy. the simulation environment will have to embed this capacity. research will be performed to propose an appropriate learning approach from acquired data on the situation and driver decisions (droniou 2014, sutton 1998). this will also enable to provide a comparative study on human and artificial ethics.  seeked profile: ? master in computer science or electrical engineering,  ? background in robotics, perception, probabilistic and bayesian reasoning ? strong programming skills (c, c++, other).  ? experience in serious games and simulation environments is a plus.  ?
