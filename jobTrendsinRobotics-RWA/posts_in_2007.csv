(tu/e)
has the following vacancy (code 51.045):



phd position on robotic interaction language



project description
===================
this project focuses on the development of the artificial robot interaction
language (roila) to improve human robot interaction. similar to other
artificial languages, such as esperanto, an initial investment from the
users is necessary. the research goal of this project is to find the right
balances between the effort necessary to learn the language and the
resulting benefit of robust communication. the language should be as closely
related to existing languages as possible to allow for a steep learning
curve but must take the limitations of current robotic technology into
account. robots¹ speech recognition, language understanding and gesture
recognition are far below the abilities of humans. philips¹ icat robot will
be used as a first reference platform since it is composed of standard
components, such as cameras and microphones. through cycles of language
design and quantitative communication evaluations an optimal solution will
be approached. an empirical benchmark test will be performed to compare the
roila against other interaction methods, such as pure natural language or
graphical user interfaces.

the project will start with a thorough literature review in the fields of
theory of formal languages, artificial intelligence, learning theory. the
student then will go through three cycles, each consisting of four phases:
requirements; design; implementation; evaluation.  each iteration cycle will
deliver a demonstrator that can be formally evaluated and be presented to
the scientific community.



the department of industrial design
===================================
the department of industrial design (id) of the technische universiteit
eindhoven (tu/e), founded in 2001, is a rapidly growing department. the
department consists of 500 students at the bachelor, master and phd level in
addition to around 80 faculty members. id focuses on intelligent products,
services and networks. these innovative products enable people to interact
with the environment in an optimal and flexible way. this project will be
embedded into the designed intelligent group (di), which is a
multidisciplinary group addressing the design of the intelligence in
adaptive systems, products and related services. the cooperating disciplines
include computer science, electrical engineering, neural computing, software
engineering, psychology and industrial design. compared to the other groups
of the department id, the designed intelligence group has the strongest
emphasis on technology.


requirements
============
the candidate should have a masters degree in one of the following areas:
industrial design, human-computer interaction, computer science,
linguistics. he/she should be seriously interested in both robotics and
artificial languages, as witnessed by project results or relevant
activities. the candidate must be able to co-operate in a multidisciplinary
team. 


appointment and salary
======================
we offer a position for a period of 4 years. phd students will receive a
monthly salary of 1,956 euro in their first year, which will rise to 2,502
euro (gross) in the final (fourth) year. eindhoven university of technology
has an excellent package of attractive benefits for employees, a child-care
facility, and a modern sports complex.

** subject

numerical models of human walking as well as numerical methods of
optimal control are now reaching enough maturity [1, 2, 3, 4] for
considering seriously the development of fully functional predictive
models of normal and pathologic walking gaits that could become in
the near future powerful tools in therapies of gait disorders [4].
the purpose of such a model would be to help predicting the outcome
of a given medical act on the gait disorder of a person and therefore
help the medical staff deciding which medical act should be
preferred. a driving problem for this thesis could be for example the
surgical treatment of spasticity disorders in young children. such a
treatment regularly consists in modifying the kinematics of the
musculoskeletal system by applying surgery to the muscles, tendons
and bones of the person so as to relieve the disorders induced by the
spasticity. the predictive model we're looking for would help
deciding which surgery to apply and how.

the first step in developing such a predictive model would be to
decide of the underlying musculoskeletal model to consider, and
especially of the muscle contraction model [5] that could cope
properly with spasticity disorders. this physiological model will
form the basis of the predictive model itself and will need to be
balanced therefore between completeness and complexity. the second
and major step is to define the functional model of walking, that is
to effectively predict how a given physiological model will walk. the
building block here will most probably be optimal control [2]: we
suppose that walking amounts in one way or another to minimizing some
measure of discomfort and fatigue. the question then is to find which
optimal control problem can adequately predict the walking gaits
which are observed on a given set of patients.

there will be a major need here for a general identification
procedure to tune the model to each patient: knowing how a person
walks, with measures coming for example from traditional motion
capture methods and electromyography, tuning the different lengths
and coefficients of the physiological model, but most of all tuning
the different parameters of the functional model (the optimal control
problem) so as to obtain a ""prediction"", a numerical ""explanation"" of
why this person walks the way he or she walks. this problem of
parameter identification will mostly induce a problem of inverse
optimal control: find which optimal control problem gives as a
solution the gait that we can observe for a given person. this is
both a theoretical and a numerical problem.

once this tuned predictive model is obtained, the final goal will be
to apply it to the medical problem presented earlier, that is to
check the outcome of different surgical acts on this numerical model
of the person's gait, propose the results of these simulations to the
medical staff and validate their appropriateness.

process range and appearance data in real-time in order to produce terrain 
classifications of a complex outdoor environment that will be used to help 
guide an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle. range and appearance data is 
available from two perspectives: 1) from lidar and image sensors on-board

on-line learning manner, to improve the performance of an autonomous 
unmanned ground vehicle. proprioception data is a measure of what the robot 
""feels"" or ""senses"" as it drives over the terrain. thus it is a natural 
source of feedback into an on-line learning mechanism to improve terrain 
classification (i.e. vegetation or rock) / characterization (i.e. measure 
of slip) which were predicted on the terrain ahead of the robot before the 
robot drove over the terrain. the ideal applicant would have demonstrated 
strengths in machine learning, and computer vision, be experienced in 
software development as a member of a large team, and work with little 
supervision.

research positions (application deadline - august 10, 
2007)
------------------------------------------------------------

the intelligent robotics research group of the university
of aveiro,   portugal  , is seeking 2 research assistants to
carry out work within the project ""langg - language
grounding for human-robot communication"".


work description
------------------
this project aims to contribute to the development of
robots that are capable of performing useful work for
humans, in unstructured human environments, and that can
be commanded and instructed by human users through
natural means of interaction. the specific goal of
the project is to develop language acquisition
capabilities that enable robots to interact with their
human users at the language level. this is related
to such research topics as computational semiotics and
biosemiotics. to attain this goal, the project is
developing an integrated set of perception, action,
interaction and learning capabilities to enable a real
robot to gradually learn the meaning of the natural
language words used by humans to refer to physical
patterns. these patterns can be physical objects in
the robot's environment (e.g. furniture, persons,
tools, toys, etc.) or  sensory-motor patterns,
corresponding to actions of the robot (e.g. turn left,
follow wall, grasp, etc.).

learning, in this scenario, must be seen as a
lifelong incremental process through which the robot
builds and maintains symbolic and subsymbolic
semantic structures that ground language in perception
and action. the planned work will focus on grounding
the names of concrete physical objects for
interaction with a robotic arm.

duration
---------
these research positions are for an initial period of
six months, but can be renewed up to one year.

phd studies
------------
there is the possibility that this work continues as
a phd project after the first six or twelve months.
such decision depends on an evaluation of the competencies
and habilitations of the selected researcher.

prerequisites
-------------
candidates should have a master degree or a portuguese
""licenciatura"" degree in computer science, electronics
engineering or related fields. preferably, candidates
should have previous experience on advanced knowledge
representation, and/or signal processing and/or machine
learning techniques.

for continuing as a phd student, the researcher should
have a licenciatura degree with a final grade of at
least 16/20 or a master degree.

application
------------
anyone interested should send, until *** 10 august 2007 
***,
his/her curriculum vitae plus a motivation letter to
prof. luis seabra lopes (lsl at det.ua.pt).

other information
------------------

research topics proposed


theme 5.1 - machine learning


tutor: prof. giorgio metta

n. of available positions: 1

in the development of an advanced robot, such as humanoids, one is expected
to encounter very complex problems. examples of these hard problems are body
control and various types of visual processing. due to the complex nature it
can be nearly impossible to solve these problems by traditional engineering
methods that rely on exact modelling. a practical example is creating a
kinematic and/or dynamic model of a robotic arm, which is very difficult
since the model should incorporate many real-world interdependent aspects,
such as gravity or friction, backlash of components, tendon stiffness, etc.

a complementary approach is to use modern machine learning techniques (e.g.
support vector machines, artificial neural networks, evolutionary computing)
to tackle these problems in a highly automated fashion.

further, these techniques can be used to deduce useful models that are
derived from biology either because we have observed human behaviour or from
the evidence of neural sciences. this biological evidence can give valuable
inspiration in the creation of a humanoid robot that shows human-like
performance.

however, the biological solutions are generally not directly applicable in a
vastly different computational environment. computational intelligence
techniques, such as the ones mentioned before, could help to create abstract
models that can be implemented on a computer.

the ideal candidate would have a background on computer science or related
disciplines and a strong propension to mix theory and practice to analyze
machine learning problems mathematically but to simultaneously devise
plausible and viable implementations on the humanoid platforms available at
the rbcs labs.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:giorgio.metta at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.2 - language and action 


tutor: francesco nori

n. of available positions: 1

recent scientific theories have suggested that language is not a module
independent from other cognitive capabilities. there is in fact strong
evidence supporting the idea that language is instead deeply intertwined
with action. moreover, the interaction between action and language has also
been hypothesized to have had a crucial role in the evolutionary origins of
language.

as a consequence of these theories, the problem of building an artificial
system with linguistic capabilities cannot be considered as a purely
perceptual task. motor capabilities are instead as fundamental as the
perceptual ones. within this context, compositionality seems to play a
crucial role by creating a wide repertoire of actions trough the combination
of a handful of elementary primitives.

the candidate should explore the implications of these novel theories by the
implementation on an artificial platform, e.g. icub. the long term goal is
to build an artificial system with some intertwined motor and linguistic
capabilities.

the ideal candidate would have a background in computer science or
engineering, with good programming skills, propensity to reuse existing
tools (e.g. asr, machine learning) and components (e.g. robot control
software) but at the same time to develop new algorithms to solve specific
problems which might not be well-structured or formalized.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
francesco.nori at iit.it


theme 5.3 - active perception in humanoid robots


tutor: dr. lorenzo natale

n. of available positions: 1

neuroscience and developmental psychology strongly agree on the importance
of motor activity for perception and learning. growing experimental evidence
demonstrates how areas directly related to motor production/generation are
involved during perceptual tasks (action recognition, speech perception).
during development, motor abilities like reaching and grasping allow infants
to explore their own body and the environment and extract information using
multiple sensory modalities at the same time (e.g. vision, sound and touch).
infants spend a huge amount of their awake life experimenting the rules
governing the world and their own body. they move their arm, legs and hands
and observe the results of their actions while banging, crashing and biting
objects.  researchers in robotics have taken inspiration from these
observations and investigated how motor activity shapes and enhance
perception in artificial systems.

artificial perception is an extremely difficult task, which has been
challenging researcher in computer vision, robotics and artificial
intelligence for several years. despite great efforts only limited success
has been achieved. robotic applications suffer of these limitations. today
we find robots able to perform sophisticated tasks fast and accurately but
only in very controlled scenarios (typical example is industrial robotics),
where perception is totally absent or very simplified. but robots are much
more brittle in everyday scenarios, where perception is required to cope
with unpredictability.

the topic of this phd is the study of perception in robotics, with the goal
to explore how robots can exploit the interaction between their body and the
environment. applications are especially in the context of robot
manipulation, with particular interest in vision, auditory and haptic
perception and their integration. possible topics include control of
attention, robot self-recognition, grasping, manipulation and object
recognition. the optimal candidate should have a background in computer
science and engineering, and be interested to study the mechanism underlying
perception in biological systems. background in electronics and mechanics is
not a requirement, but considered that the phd will be carried out working
on a robotic platform, the candidate should consider that he might be asked
to contribute to system level design and low-level hardware and software
development.

lorenzo.natale at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:lorenzo.natale at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.4 - human-robot interaction and the mirror-neuron system


tutor: prof. giorgio metta

n. of available positions: 1

the human mirror neuron system can be probed through human-robot interaction
experiments and the measurements of behavioural parameters (kinematics,
forces, gaze, etc.). in particular, experiments can be designed to measure
gaze during observation of actions performed by a humanoid artefact.
experiments will be devoted to clarify the characteristics of the observed
action that evoke pro-active gaze behaviour. the monitoring of eye movements
of human participants will be used to reflect the activity of a motor
resonance involving a mirror-neuron system. during the experiment we will
ask subjects, seated in front of the robot, to merely observe its actions.
by using the artefact, we will, for instance, investigate three different
cues. (i) role of the kinematics; (ii) modulation of the empathic link
between the robot and the subject ('enriched familiarization'); (iii)
subjects will be requested to act on some objects (by grasping and
displacing them or by putting some of them within a particular container)
while the robot looks at their actions.

simultaneously, studies on the goal of the action and of kinematic
parameters (transitive/intransitive actions) can be performed on human
subjects. in this set of experiments manipulation of both the plausibility
of the goal of the action and of the kinematic parameters of the movement
are devised. the experimenter and the subject will be sitting at a table,
one in front of the other. subjects will be given the instruction to watch
the action performed by the experimenter and then to repeat it. no explicit
instruction on how to imitate the observed action will be given to the
subjects. we will present both transitive and intransitive movements, and
the demonstrator will execute the movements with different kinematics. these
sets of experiments and the corresponding gaze/reaching/grasping kinematic
recordings will constitute a database which can be subjected to various
modelling efforts, for example through non-parametric and machine learning
techniques. 

the ideal candidate would have a background in human psychophysics and/or
related disciplines.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
giorgio.metta at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:giorgio.metta at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.5 - whole body motion for humanoid robots


tutor: dr. sophie sakka

n. of available positions: 1

the kinematics of a humanoid robot is close to humans. still, some
unavoidable differences appear which make the imitation of human motion by a
humanoid robot a difficult task. during this ph.d. program, the research
will focus on whole body motion for humanoid robots, using human captured
motion as a basis model, and converting them into motion compatible with the
kinematic constraints of a humanoid robot.

after implementing traditional approaches for whole body motion generation,
the candidate will work on improved models allowing an autonomous imitation
of baby-like locomotion. a special attention shall be paid to the transition
between crawling-based displacements, including them into a pertinent
definition of variable support polygons during locomotion and control of
posture changes (four-leg crawling -> sitting -> four-leg crawling ->
standing up using hand grasping for standing up).

the ideal candidate would have a background in computer science or
engineering, control theory, modelling and robotics.

for more details concerning the research project, please contact:
sophie.sakka at lms.univ-poitiers.fr
<blocked::blocked::mailto:sophie.sakka at lms.univ-poitiers.fr> 

 


theme 5.6: composite materials based on carbon nanotubes for robotics


tutor: dr. davide ricci

n. of available positions: 1

the evolution of humanoid platforms designed to collaborate with humans will
be from rigid toward soft components specifically addressing technologies of
skeletal, actuation and sensorial components in an integrated way. within
this framework, a fundamental technological issue is the development of
elastic actuators composed of fibers with mechanical properties similar to
those of biological muscles. while the ultimate goal could be considered the
development of organic muscles, the intermediate approach this ph.d. project
will follow is the development of more traditional actuators that take
advantage of the properties of hybrid nanocomposite materials. the main
issues to be addressed are: power/weight and power/volume performance,
compliance and stiffness regulation, robustness, control behaviour. to this
end, the ph.d. research work will be devoted to the development of ""soft""
materials based on an appropriate blending of polymers and carbon nanotubes
capable of actuation. incorporation of other functionalities such as power
storage, electron transport and force transfer within a single engineered
structure will be also pursued.

the ideal candidate would have a background in one or more of the following
fields: material science,  sensor and actuators,  micromechanics,
nanotechnology.

for further details concerning the research project, please contact:
davide.ricci at iit.it <blocked::blocked::mailto:davide.ricci at iit.it> 

 


theme 5.7: dexterous hand for humanoid robots


tutor: dr. lorenzo masia

no. available positions: 1

humanoid robot kinematics must mimick the human motion. in order to
reproduce movements and dynamics closest to human's ones, a humanoid must
have a high number of dofs.

actuaction plays an essential role in dynamics and kinematics; human body is
powered by muscles and tendons in a redundant configuration in a variable
impedance control strategy.

available actuators on market are nowadays characterized by a small
bandwidth and high weight-power ratio: this means  in order to have a system
behaving with a dynamic comparable with human's one, it must be actuated by
small inertia (and power) actuators.   the main idea is to turn around the
problem by developing a modular robot in which each module has its own
dynamic behavior and actuators: a hybrid system. 

objective of the research is to design and characterize a 9 dof  biomimetic
inspired hand 

to be coupled with a humanoid robot available at iit robotic lab. the
candidate must design the hardware meeting the requirements and characterize
it investigating kinematics and dynamics.

atl) at tufts university in medford, part of the greater boston area in
massachusetts, usa. more information is available at:
http://ase.tufts.edu/bdl

this position is for an engineer with a good background in innovative design
who can work in an academic setting with a diverse group of biologists and
researchers from all the major engineering departments. the ideal candidate
must be willing to work with non-traditional materials and be able to
interact with computer scientists, electrical engineers, and biologists.
familiarity with elastomers, casting methods and robotics will be welcome
skills but are not essential for otherwise well-qualified candidates. in
addition to building these robots, the candidate is expected to contribute
to scholarship in the form of research publications, patents, grant
applications and other collegial activities.

this darpa funded project is a two year phase of research and development to
produce shape-changing robots. the approach is biomimetic, based on the
structural, mechanical and neural mechanisms that are found in soft-bodied
animals such as caterpillars. a key thrust of the project is to use “smart”
materials and structures to ultimately simplify the electronic control of
the robot. other collaborators at tufts are simultaneously developing

school of computer science
two research fellowships to work on cognitive robotics projects

applications are invited for two research fellowships, starting as soon as 
possible after 1 february 2008 on a project due to end on 30 june 2012. the 
posts are to work on two major eu funded projects: cosy: cognitive systems 
for cognitive assistants, and cogx: cognitive systems that self-understand 
and self-extend.

the first post (ref s43238) will be concerned with the learning of 
affordances of objects via simple manipulation. the work will in the later 
stages look at modular motor learning as a framework for carrying out this 
activity. the research will be concerned with integrating novel methods in 
computer vision with manipulation abilities to allow the robot to acquire 
knowledge about the behaviour of objects by experimental manipulation. you 
will have a strong background in robotic manipulation and computer vision.

the second post (ref s43237) will be concerned with planning information 
processing and information gathering within a cognitive architecture. the 
person appointed to this post will work on new methods for reasoning and 
planning about sensing and perceptual processing in a mobile robot able to 
manipulate objects, with an emphasis on visual processing. one goal of the 
work will be to develop new methods for choosing sensing actions and making 
inferences about a scene when the robot has to make decisions about where 
to look, and what visual processing to perform. another goal will be to 
develop new planning techniques that combine the benefits of decision 
theoretic planning with those of symbolic planning to support a robot that 
can reason about what it can learn, and cope with uncertainty in action and 
sensing. you will have a strong background in probabilistic reasoning, and 
preferably of planning algorithms.

you will work in a team of six researchers at birmingham and along with 
partner groups in five other universities. the cosy project is described at 
the following sites: www.cognitivesystems.org and 
www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/ information on the cogx project 
is available at www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/robotics/ .

the intelligent robotics lab is a growing centre for research in robotics, 
cognition and machine learning in the uk. we collaborate with engineers, 
psychologists and biologists to develop new ideas and techniques. the group 
currently has 13 members, including 3 faculty, 4 postdoctoral researchers 
and six doctoral students, and holds over 1.9m pounds in external research 
funding. as part of your duties you will also be encouraged to contribute 
to grant writing, and setting the research agenda for the future work of 
the group. strong communication and management skills are therefore 
essential.

you must hold or be working towards the achievement of a phd in computer 
science, ai, cognitive science, engineering or a related subject, or 
equivalent research experience, including if possible robotics/vision 
research experience and linux expertise. in exceptional circumstances we 
will consider appointment from someone in a related field with relevant 
experience, such as psychology or neuroscience. you will need excellent 
programming skills, in c/c++ or java, together with the ability to engineer 
software to very high standards of reliability.

217,2007,post. doc. jobs in active sonar in denmark and belgium,"active sonar perception inspired by bats

... at universiteit antwerpen, antwerpen, belgium, and university of
southern denmark (sdu), odense, denmark in the framework of the eu
project chiroping (01/02/2008 -- 31/01/2011).

chiroping is a multidisciplinary research collaboration between 4
universities in the area of sensing for autonomous systems.

the principal objective of the project is to discover how to engineer
embodied active sonar perception systems which can serve as a complement
to vision and facilitate the deployment of robotic systems in situations
where vision is infeasible.

the project will implement and evaluate two demonstration systems built
as biomimetic models of an insect gleaning and a water-trawling bat
species respectively. it will use a classic biomimetic methodology,
involving close collaboration between bat ethologists and roboticists.
it will proceed by identifying and measuring the relevant acoustic and
morphological parameters of a few carefully selected bat species,
reconstructing from that the bat's acoustic experience as it flies
through natural hunting tasks. from this data, computational models of
how the bat coordinates its acoustic, behavioural and morphological
choices during hunting will be elicited and implemented on appropriate
robotic systems.
