            ***** phd student position available *****

       center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)
                     orebro university,  sweden 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.


about orebro university:

orebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university currently enrolling
more than 15,000 students.  it is located in orebro, a city of 130,000
inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the aass mobile robotics lab is one of the three research groups within
the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass).  aass carries
out multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science,
and measurement technology.  the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come from a dozen different
countries, in europe and worldwide, and have different scientific and
cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently hosts international
researchers and is involved in several international projects.  this
means, particularly in the gert project, that the enrolled phd student
will have the opportunity to travel and to cooperate with people in
other countries.

the aass mobile robotics lab is internationally renowned for its
research in cognitive robots, robot ecologies and artificial olfaction.
further information can be found at www.aass.oru.se/research/robots/.

the student will work under the joint supervision of alessandro saffiotti
and lars karlsson.  the student will receive a monthly salary adequate to
the cost of living in  sweden , and will be included in the swedish social
security system.


prerequisites and application process:

in addition to a clear interest in the research topic, to a strong
theoretical background in computer science, and to solid programming
skills, the applicant should have a masters or equivalent degree in an
appropriate field (including computer science, computer engineering, or
robotics).  knowledge of the swedish language is not required, but
proficiency in written/spoken english is mandatory.  candidates with
previous experience in artificial intelligence or in robotics will be
preferred.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to

project details
===========
project number: fp7 strep grant agreement 248942
project title:    roboearth: robots sharing a knowledge base for world
                    modelling and learning of actions

abstract
=======   
roboearth is a world-wide platform which robots can use to exchange
position and map information as well as task-related, hardware
independent action recipes. this will enable manufacturers worldwide
to break down their costs and efforts for reproducing software algorithms
for robot behaviour over and over again. the roboearth framework can
store all relevant data from algorithms to complex behaviour descriptions
what allows robots to act autonomously in an unknown, unspecified
environment. especially in the field of interaction with humans roboearth
can bring forward the behaviour of robots and simplify the software
design for developers in that field.

vacancy 1: simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) for mobile 
robots navigation.
=============================================================
the initial goal is to investigate the integration of odometry,
visual senors and laser for a safe collision free map building
in an unknown environment exploiting the available roboearth
priors. robot motion goal is to improve the available scene map.
visual sensor calibration both extrinsic and intrinsic is considered
only weakly known in order to preserve the system hardware independence.

in a second stage, the goal is to perform the safe navigation and
map building using only visual sensors and odometry. visual sensors
calibration would be only weakly known in order to preserve the
system hardware independence.

vacancy 2: semantic based mapping
=============================================================
the main objective is to research how to exploit a world wide database
in the appearance mapping process. on one hand, the prior information
available in the data base has to be exploited to improve the mapping
method, focusing the recognition and localization of objects intended
for interaction with the robot. on the other hand, the information
gathered during the robot operation has to be processed by learning
methods in order to enrich the information contained in roboearth database.

the project proposes to investigate techniques 
for a multi-robot team to act coordinately and cooperatively. this involves
planning, navigation, perception with different 
sensors, learning and communications.

the task of the selected candidate towards the phd is in the following context:

title.- cooperative missions with connectivity restrictions.
summary.- the team of robots should cooperate in 
perception, action and communications. one key 
topic inside the cooperation is to share the 
information. the research proposed for the 
student towards the phd aims to reply to the 
questions: ""which"", ""when"" and ""how"" the 
information owned by each robot should be shared. 
it is assumed that the team of robots must carry 
out the mission in conditions of 
restricted  bandwidth and network connectivity. 
part of the research will be focused in the 
construction, actualization and planning of 
communications maps integrating geometric and 
topological information, as well as 
communications coverage. its is very important to 
classify the information to be shared when 
carrying out cooperative perception or navigation 
just to maintain the functional and temporal 
integrity of the mission. in networks with 
bandwidth restrictions the amount of information 
to be shared should be minimized. the security, 
the bandwidth and the temporal constraints should 
be guaranteed by the proposed wireless protocols.

the applications should be introduced by the 
candidates in the micinn web page. (expected during january)
the conducted research should be done during 4 years.
salary: around 1200 euros/month

design and implementation of a reconfigurable bioinspired
auditory sensor for the humanoid robot hrp2
======================================================================

robot audition is a fairly  new research area.  the auditory modality,
which   is  near-omnidirectional   and  insensitive   to  illumination
conditions, constitutes an ideal complement to vision.  in the topical
human-robot interaction context,  audition can enable the localization
of a speaker located outside the robot viewfield, his/her recognition,
the extraction of  his/her utterance out of the  environment, prior to
the interpretation of his/her message.

two approaches to robot audition  can be envisioned.  on the one hand,
array processing methods exploit the  redundancy of the data sensed by
an array  of microphones so as  to improve the  properties of auditory
functions  under design:  resolution of  source  localization, spatial
filtering  efficiency,  robustness to  noise,...   in  this vein,  the
laas-cnrs has developed an integrated  auditory sensor on the basis of
a linear  array of 8 microphones  and a fpga processing  unit.  on the
other hand, binaural approaches consist in fitting two ears on a head,
and  mimic  the human  system  to  various  extents.  yet,  exploiting
bioinspired cues may require a  very accurate model of propagation, as
well as a careful  identification---generally in an anechoic room---of
the scattering  of the  wavefield induced by  the head.   such systems
often  lack  adaptability  when  facing realistic,  a  priori  unknown
environments.    on  the  whole,   biomimetic  approaches   to  source
localization and extraction have so far led to mitigated results.

the proposed post-doctoral study  aims at designing and implementing a
bioinspired sensor  for the hrp2  humanoid robot hosted  by laas-cnrs.
this  sensor  will  comply  with  the  geometrical  and  computational
foundations involved in humans.  so, the hrp2 head will be fitted with
two pinnae  which reproduce the  spatial filtering performed  by human
ears.  similarly, the physico-electrical transduction will reflect the
human operation,  e.g.  through the tonotopic frequency  coding in the
cochlea, the global response of  the hair cells, etc.  the sensor will
have  to  be  embeddable   and  reconfigurable,  in  order  to  enable
experiments  on  the  robot  as  well as  iterations  and  adjustments
necessary to an ""optimal""  design.  on this sensory basis, bioinspired
acoustic  cues (interaural amplitude  and phase  differences, monaural
spectral cues,  etc.) will  be generated and  will serve as  basis for
localization.   an  evaluation  will  be  conducted on  how  a  strong
biomimetism affects  the accuracy  and robustness of  localization and
extraction strategies  in the changing  and unpredictable environments

post-doc vision for nanomanipulation

the vision team in the sammi group works since several years on 
microvision and visual servoings for the manipulation and assembly of 
mems (/micro-electro-mechanical systems/) and is involved in these 
problematics in the framework of an european project called hydromel.
the post-doc is in the continuity of these works with an orientation to 
the manipulation of components with a size <1µm. at this scale, optical 
microscopy is not efficient and the more adapted vision sensor is the 
scanning electron microscope (sem). the works envisaged during this 
post-doc concern calibration model of the sem, development of image 
processing methods and design of visual servoing control laws dedicated 
to the nanomanipulation in the sem.

we are seeking two post-doctoral research associates and four phd student
research assistants to work on the following three projects. applicants
should send cv and selected papers to mjzhang at utk.edu

*project one: *the research objective of this proposal is to study the
fundamental mechanics and mechanical properties of the nanoparticles-based
adhesive secretion produced by ivy rootlets for surface affixing and
climbing.  both experimental (using afm) and theoretical (mathematical
modeling) studies will be conducted. more generally, we aim to use insight
from nature to elucidate theoretical principles governing the extraordinary
adhesive properties of ivy.  the specific aims are:

specific aim 1:  characterize the intra- and inter- molecular bonding forces
and determine how they can be used to explain interactions that exist both
between components of the ivy adhesive secretion and between the secretion
and the affixing surface.

specific aim 2:  characterize the macroscopic mechanical properties of
natural ivy secretions.

specific aim 3:  determine structure-property relationships via systematic
alteration of the composition of the natural ivy secretions.

specific aim 4:  build finite element models (fem) to quantitatively
characterize and interpret the adhesive properties of ivy nanoparticles.

*project two:* the goal of this research is to develop a highly sensitive
and specific lab-on-a-chip device for comprehensive cardiovascular disease
(cvd) risk factor analysis.  it is well-known that cardiovascular disease is
related to multiple risk factors, but it is still not clear how these risk
factors in combination contribute to the disease, and how they can be used
to diagnose as well as treat the disease.  the elisa assay has often been
used for risk factor analysis, but it is time-consuming and not
cost-effective, especially for multiple risk factor analysis.  currently, no
well-developed techniques can be used for simultaneous multiple risk factor
analysis for cardiovascular disease.  a device is needed that can generate
fast, highly specific and sensitive data on multiple risk factors
simultaneously, so that researchers can use the data for studying the
pathology of cardiovascular disease.  such a device can also be used in
clinics for the cardiovascular risk factor assessment and treatment.

*project three:* external control of a complex cellular system, s.
cerevisiae. this research will demonstrate external, multivariable control
of the budding yeast, a relatively well-characterized complex system. the
experimental studies will integrate both feedback and feed-forward control
of highly instrumented, computer-controlled microfabricated bioreactor, and
enable on-demand selection of metabolic and signaling pathways and hence
control of cell fate.

************************************************

the electronics and computer science laboratory of ensta-paristech (http://www.ensta.fr), carrying out academic and industrial research in robotics and vision, offers an engineer / post-doctoral position to develop, characterize and optimize vision applications on off-the-shelf parallel computing platform. 
instances of such platform range from multicore processors and gpu to low power multimedia circuit embedded in cell phones (e.g. ti omap). they use dedicated development environments and operating systems, that will need specific learning efforts, possibly including some hardware aspects.  
applications will be related to mobile robotics or video surveillance. more specifically, object characterization and recognition, or visual cartography and navigation for autonomous vehicle will be considered. parallel computing will naturally be used to accelerate the most intensive tasks, such as feature extraction (e.g. salient points), or the implementation of machine learning techniques. a key issue will be to manage irregularity in data processing. 
algorithmic choices, in particular those dealing with the target application or the adequation with the chosen architecture, will be made in collaboration with one or more faculty members, and the resulting works are vowed to be published.  
the preferred profile of the applicant is a post-doctoral researcher with particular interest in the actual realization of his ideas. he/she may hold only an ms, but with some additional professional experience (in such a case, the proposed position could then open to a phd position).

knowledge and skills:
- comfortable with programming, including c and c++, and algorithmics
- knowledgeable in hard/soft-ware, operating systems, parallel computing
- image processing and/or machine learning skills appreciated

human qualities:
- motivation, tenacity

active compensation of pathological tremor using fes

environnement
tremor is defined as the involuntary rhythmic or semi rhythmic 
oscillation of a body part resulting from alternating of simultaneous 
contractions of antagonistic muscle groups. the tremor frequency may 
change but motion is always sinusoidal. tremor is the most common 
abnormal motion encountered in human pathology. it is classified 
depending on the source and can be a rest tremor or an action tremor 
(kinetic or postural). the origin, the functional consequences and the 
treatment may change depending on the pathology. pathological tremor 
affects 5-9% of the population age 40 and above. common causes of 
pathological tremor include parkinson’s disease or cerebellar 
dysfunctions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke, etc.). not only does this 
involuntary movement impair the activities of daily living of many 
patients, it also often leads to social embarrassment and even 
isolation. the lifetime economical and social cost as a result of a 
reduction in independence is an enormous burden to an individual, as 
well as the society.
the main objective of the project is then to propose an alternate 
solution to actual pharmacological or surgical therapies that may have 
limited results. this alternate solution is based on the active tremor 
compensation of the upper limbs via functional electrical stimulation. 
the tremor project is composed of 4 subsections (two scientific, one 
technological and one clinical) which are successively i) modeling of 
pathological tremor, ii) synthesis of algorithms for active tremor 
compensation, iii) design of a prototype for a wearable orthosis and iv) 
clinical evaluation.
it involves a research laboratory (lirmm) through the research teams 
dexter and demar, a company (mxm) expert in functional electrical 
stimulation and two clinical partners (chu of montpellier, neurology 
department, and propara rehabilitation center).

missions
currently, tremor modelling and filtering algorithms have been developed 
to better understand the physiological phenomenon of tremor and to 
separate voluntary motion from disturbed motion subject to tremor. we 
are now in the phase of developing closed loop control algorithms and 
testing clinically all the proposed algorithms.

activities
within the duration of the post-doctoral position, the main goals to be 
achieved are then:
•to evaluate first the feasibility and efficiency of fes to reduce upper 
limb tremor in open loop. the outcome of this will be a set of 
strategies in terms of stimulated muscles and fes parameters adapted to 
given patient profiles.
•to implement new closed loop control algorithms for compensating tremor 
based on inertial sensors (e.g. accelerometers) and physiological 
sensors (e.g. emg),
•to evaluate clinically the filtering and control algorithms in closed 
loop on a large set of patients
all experiments have been submitted to the authorization of the ethical 
committee obtained in september 2009.

657,2010,"postdoc and phd positions in parallel robotics in montpellier, france","[apologies for multiple postings]

dear colleagues,

a 12-month postdoctoral position and a three year phd position in 
parallel robotics are available within the dexter project team of the 
lirmm robotics department in montpellier, france.

both the postdoctoral researcher and the phd student will be involved in 
the project cogiro, ""control of giant robots"", which deals with parallel 
cable-driven robots having very large workspaces and possibly heavy 
payloads. cogiro is a three-year project (2010-2012) funded by the 
french national research agency (anr). the partners of the project 
consist of three french research labs (lirmm, lasmea and inria sophia 
antipolis) and one company (fatronik france).

a parallel cable-driven robot consists mainly of a mobile platform, a 
set of winches and a number of cables connecting in parallel the 
platform to the winches. generally, the winches are fixed to the ground 
(or to walls, to a frame, ...) and each cable is attached to the mobile 
platform at one end. at its other end, the cable is wound by means of 
one of the winches. the control of the length of each cable allows the 
control of the position and orientation of the mobile platform. cable 
actuation enables the realization of robots having very large 
workspaces, potentially allowing the automation of tasks which can 
hardly be accomplished by conventional robots.

robotics department website (http://www.lirmm.fr/w3rob/):

661,2010,postdoc position: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment,"development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for ultra-fast smart camera 
in soc environment

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.
in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.
the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.
in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

a phd position is available on the gert project (generalising robot
manipulation tasks) in the intelligent robotics lab at the university
of birmingham in the uk. the position includes a stipend at standard
uk rates (£13,290 per annum initially). applicants should be citizens
of the european union.

the specific goal of the phd will be to apply techniques from
stochastic process control to the automatic discovery of finger
closing strategies for a multi-fingered robot hand when grasping novel
objects of known surface shape. the result will be finger closing
strategies that are robust to variations in the relative position of
the robot hand and object, object orientation, and other environmental
properties. in particular the approach will use finger closing
strategies for known objects as seeds in the search for robust
controllers.

the successful applicant will have an outstanding degree in computer
science, mathematics, physics, or electronic engineering. you should
be in the top 5% of your graduating class, with exceptional
communication, coding and mathematical skills.

the project is part of an fp7 funded strep project, held jointly with
the german aerospace research institute (munich), orebro university
( sweden ) and the max planck institute for biological cybernetics
(tuebingen).

the overall project goals are as follows:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots will need to be much  more flexible and robust in the
face of novelty. in this project we will develop new methods to cope
with novelty in manipulation tasks. our approach is to enable the
robot to autonomously generalize its manipulation skills to new
objects. the basic idea is that some successful implementations of a
certain robot manipulation task, such as serving a drink, are given as
input. the aim is that these programs then constitute a database of
prototypes representing that class of task. when confronted with a
novel instance of the same task the robot needs to generalize from the
prototypes, establishing appropriate correspondences between objects
and actions in the prototypes and their counterparts in the novel
scenario. in this way, prototypical task plans may be mapped to a new
plan that is suitable for handling different geometric, kinematic, and
dynamic task settings, hence solving a task that is physically
substantially different but similar at an abstract level. this kind of
knowledge transfer or generalization shall not be restricted just to
the most abstract layer. rather, low-level primitives as well as high-
level logical robot actions and operators will be adapted.

*hardware and software development of robots under neural control. *our 
group specializes in the development of alternative control methods for 
robots. we use neuronal circuitry and mechanisms of neural plasticity 
(learning) to control machines with up to 20dof. this type of research 
is internationally highly competitive and has led to the development of 
/runbot/, which had been for some time the fastest dynamic biped walker 
(see the internet for runbot, manoonpong et al., plos cb, 2007), 
/amos-wd6/, a hexapod which uses deterministic chaos to control its 
walking (steingrube et al., nature physics, 2010) as well as /3d-trunk/, 
an elephant-like trunk (ning and wörgötter, ieee-tro, 2009). thus, our

recently we have started to investigate how to emulate “dynamic motor 
primitives” (dmps, ijspeert and schaal 2003sss) by neural circuitry, by 
which they would become accessible to neural plasticity, offering an 
efficient learning method. in this field we cooperate with kit

the global project aims at addressing 4 complementary challenges that have
been identified as crucial to the development of future humanoid robotics:

* challenge 1: how can a robot learn efficient perceptual representations of
its body and of external objects given initially only low-level perceptual
capabilities?
* challenge 2: how can a robot learn motor representations and use them to
build basic affordant reaching and manipulation skills?
* challenge 3: what guidance heuristics should be used to explore vast
sensorimotor spaces in unknown changing bodies and environments?
* challenge 4: how can mechanisms for building efficient
representations/abstractions, mechanisms for learning manipulation skills,
and guidance mechanisms be integrated in the same experimental robotic
architecture and reused for different robots?

the 4 challenges are distributed over four partners:

ensta-paristech (paris) will lead challenge 1. the contact is david
filliat (david.filliat at ensta.fr). see
http://cogrob.ensta.fr/

funded by the eu-fp7 capacites project ""efficient 3d completeness inspection"" 
(resp. prof. e. menegatti).

our project
-------------------
""efficient 3d completeness inspection"":
one important application of machine vision is quality control and in particular checking the completeness (presence/absence of parts, correct type, position, orientation, ...) of assemblies.
existing systems usually use standard monochrome or color cameras which produce a 2d  image. these images lack the information of depth and therefore it is difficult to
deal with non-rigid objects (hoses, cables) or low contrast between background and
parts. finally, they do not provide, often, an optimal view on each single part of the assembly.
this project aims at developing efficient 3d completeness inspection methods that
exploit two different innovative technologies. the first one is based on calculating arbitrary views of an object given a small number of images of this object, the second one aims at
combining 3d shape data obtained with laser range scanners with color and texture information. both technologies to be developed will cover the full chain from data acquisition via pre-processing to the final decision-making. the projects aims at developing a cost-effective technology, that will need standard computing hardware platforms.
3d completeness inspection is a technological gap in the machine vision market. the project is a collaboration between 3 smes and 3 research centers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

a phd position in the area of autonomous robotics is available at the
aass mobile robotics lab, orebro university,  sweden .  this is a 3-year
phd position fully funded within the eu project gert - ""generalizing
robot manipulation tasks"".

this position is for an immediate start, and it will be open until a
suitable candidate is found.


about the project:

in order to work naturally in human environments such as offices and
homes, robots in the future will need to be much more flexible and robust
in the face of novelty than they are today.  in the gert project we will
address this problem by developing new methods to cope with such novelty
in manipulation tasks.  the overall aim of the gert project is to enable a
robot to autonomously generalise its manipulation skills from a set of
known objects to previously unmanipulated objects in order to achieve an
everyday manipulation task.  the platform that will be used within gert is
the dlr robot justin, an advanced robot with two arms with four-fingered
hands.  the gert consortium consists of four european partners: the german
aerospace center (dlr) and the max planck institute from germany, the
university of birmingham from great britain, and orebro university from
 sweden .

the student will do research about hybrid planning for the robot in the
context of the gert project.  this means that, when planning for a task,
the robot needs to reason both about the purposes of actions on a symbolic
level, and about the kinematics and geometry of the robot and the objects
it manipulate.  apart from working towards the phd thesis, the enrolled
phd student will be involved in the project work, which is expected to
include research visits to our european partners.


about orebro university:

orebro university (www.oru.se) is a young university currently enrolling
more than 15,000 students.  it is located in orebro, a city of 130,000
inhabitants situated in central  sweden .

the aass mobile robotics lab is one of the three research groups within
the center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass).  aass carries
out multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of robotics, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science,
and measurement technology.  the research and human environment at aass
is young and enthusiastic.  researchers come from a dozen different
countries, in europe and worldwide, and have different scientific and
cultural backgrounds.  aass also frequently hosts international
researchers and is involved in several international projects.  this
means, particularly in the gert project, that the enrolled phd student
will have the opportunity to travel and to cooperate with people in
other countries.

the aass mobile robotics lab is internationally renowned for its
research in cognitive robots, robot ecologies and artificial olfaction.
further information can be found at www.aass.oru.se/research/robots/.

the student will work under the joint supervision of alessandro saffiotti
and lars karlsson.  the student will receive a monthly salary adequate to
the cost of living in  sweden , and will be included in the swedish social
security system.


prerequisites and application process:

the applicant should have a strong theoretical background in computer
science, a clear interest in the research topic, and good programming
skills.  a masters or equivalent degree in computer science or computer
engineering is required.  knowledge of swedish is not required, but
proficiency in written/spoken english is mandatory.  candidates with
good experience in artificial intelligence will be preferred.

to apply for the position, please send a motivation letter along with an
updated cv (including at least two academic references) by email to
prof. alessandro saffiotti <asaffio at aass.oru.se>.  applications will be
accepted starting immediately and until a suitable candidate is found.

provide a customized and efficient version of the proteus tools in  
order to organize a two steps open competition. the first step will be  
done by using simulation with the customized proteus toolset, the  
second step will be done using a real instrumented urban vehicle on  
the pavin site.

more precizely, the work to be done is to:
1/ integrate the consortium and assist the consortium meetings.
the project is splitted in 4 main workpackages: robotic simulation  
models and formalisms (wp1), languages and tools (wp2), challenges  
(wp3), dissemination and exploitation (wp4)
2/ customize and validate the proteus toolset (to develop all the  
necessary models, to describe the environment and the scenario of the  
challenge)
the main difficulty is to elaborate and validate relevant sensor  
models in order to generate sensor data from digital environment  
(pavin site is now available in 3dmax format).
3/ provide sets of sensors data both in simulation and real  
environment (in order to evaluate alogorithms of localization, motion  
planning, control and obstacle avoidance)
4/ generate and manage the lasmea deliverables within the project

--------
theme 2.7: incremental learning for compliant robots through the superposition of basis force fields

the aim of this phd proposal is to study incremental learning techniques applied to compliant robots. the advantage of moving from offline to online learning is twofold. compared to stiff robots, compliant robots allow users to get close to the robot, sharing not only the same environment but also the same tasks. the development of compliant robots facilitates the demonstration of new skills by using kinesthetic teaching (e.g., by using gravity compensation to move the robot as if it had no weight). when working in collaboration with robots, this type of interaction increase the quantity of data collected by the robots, and it becomes important to consider demonstration and reproduction as an interlaced process where the robot gradually refines its skill.

models based on a superposition of basis force fields have interesting characteristics for online learning, since most of the computation can be performed in parallel (each basis force field can be refined independently). exploiting the parallel computation power of graphics processing unit (gpu) for machine learning purpose is a recent but rapidly growing trend of research that could provide robots with cheap and portable parallel processing capabilities. another route is to consider learning as both a continuous and disruptive adaptation process. incremental learning techniques consist most of the time of progressive and continuous adjustments that allow the system to handle perturbations and slowly varying environments and adaptation to the robot's capabilities. however, as their biological counterparts, such systems would also occasionally benefit from disruptive adaptation mechanisms. cubs can optimize their crawling skills until their legs are strong enough to explore a completely different way of moving on two legs. it is proposed to study robot learning strategies allowing to acquire and refine skills through such a combination of imitation, exploration, evaluation of performance and practice.

for further details, please contact: sylvain.calinon at iit.it

--------
theme 2.8: from trajectory learning to force skills acquisition in compliant robotic arms

kinesthetic teaching offers a user-friendly and intuitive method to teach robots new skills. compliant robots offer new perspectives in this direction, where torque feedback can be used to let the user move the robot as if it had no weight, and as if no motors were in its articulations. through gravity compensation actuation, the user can concentrate on the task to demonstrate by grasping and re-grasping the robot in ways that are natural and efficient for him/her to execute the task. this proposal aims at extending the range of skills that a robot can learn by moving the representation of the task constraints to the force domain. it is first proposed to explore how robot learning capabilities can be improved through the use of both torque information at the level of the joints and force sensing at the level of the end-effector. it is then suggested to explore the simultaneous consideration of multiple constraints in the force domain (e.g. by considering multiple contact points), which would offer new perspectives in physical human-robot interaction.

for further details, please contact: sylvain.calinon at iit.it

--------
theme 2.9: safe human-robot interaction

traditional and new markets ranging from the industrial field to the service robotics, both for professional and domestic applications show an increasing desire for innovative robots able to collaborate with humans. one of the current challenges in robotics is therefore to improve safety in human-robot interaction. it is well known that collaborative tasks need to be performed in a flexible manner, where humans work side-by side with robots sharing workspace and objects. the risk assessment used for industrial applications guarantees safety around the robot by drawing a no go area where motion of the robot is halted if a human intrusion is detected. this approach, however, is far too restrictive for tasks where humans are required to closely interact with robots. as a consequence, considerable research is conducted, both at the hardware and software level to decrease the risk while improving the safety in human-robot interaction. at the hardware level, compliant actuators have been proposed as a safer approach for driving robots which have to interact with humans. using compliant actuators it is possible to reduce the forces of an impact between a robot and a human, in the cases of an unexpected collision. within the long-term project to develop a compliant humanoid robot (amarsi, european project), one open phd position is available. the aim of this project is to develop a control strategy for a multi-dof compliant robotic system along with the analysis of the optimal stiffness and the input trajectory profiles for minimizing energy consumption. at the software level, control strategies for adjusting the robot's behavior on the basis of the detected level of hazard in human robot interaction are required. the aim of the project is to first define a risk indicator on the basis of the safety restrictions (user or robot side) depending on the task to accomplish. this is necessary to continuously let the robot be aware of the environmental changes with respect to its internal state. the project will investigate how to construct the risk indicator and which are the parameters to take into account for describing changing safety constraints for several different tasks. task redundancy and user intention will mainly be considered for this purpose. then a control strategy will be implemented to accomplish the required tasks on the basis of the current level of risk. the project includes the use of the kuka lwr and/or barrett wam robotic arm.

the candidates should have a background in engineering, mathematics or physical sciences (control theory, system modeling) and computer science. required technical skills:  matlab, c/c++.

*title of post-doc: development of 3d reconstruction algorithms for 
ultra-fast smart camera in soc environment*

* *

*description*

the purpose of this post-doc (proposed in virago project) is to use a 
smart stereo camera (designed at lasmea) based on the reconfigurable 
logic and cmos imagers. the main objective is to use a methodology 
matching the architecture and vision algorithms, to develop an optimal 
system of high speed embedded vision.

in fact, in conventional approaches, the use of cameras can be 
summarized by image storage and an ""offline"" processing. however these 
systems are expensive and completely inconsistent with the ""real time"" 
control of robots. also, for direct use in the control loop of robot, it 
is necessary to have real time ""sensor"" information.

the approach proposed here is to process the large amount of information 
directly into the camera to eliminate the ""bottleneck"" between the 
sensor and control system. the second point is to use sensors using 
""rolling shutter"" cmos technology. the project virago is built on a 
major innovation (winner of a european conference on computer vision 
2006) which involves the exploitation of algorithm using this 
technology. in the ""rolling shutter"" mode, all pixels of the imager are 
not simultaneously exposed to light but sequentially line by line. when 
the relative speed between camera and scene becomes very large, 
deformations or distortions appear in the image. these distortions are 
not taken into account in the classical perspective projection which 
considers the observation of a rigid world. this creates unusable images 
from cameras rolling shutter during pose estimation, and hence for 
three-dimensional reconstruction. this model allows calculating the 
accurate placement of the object but also operates the distortions 
induced by this phenomenon for measuring the instantaneous speed of 3d 
rigid objects.

in this case, the vision system is planned to have the low-level 
processing and technical computing compensating defects closer to the 
retina so as to provide not an image (which must be transferred to pc 
for processing) but a direct geometrical information (position, 
orientation, speed). this should provide such information at the rates 
of 1000 hz, consistent with the rapid control of robots, and details 
that are usually less than a few hertz frequency.

more details about the phd subject:

the first task will consist in designing a specific embedded system for 
the perception and tracking of local deformations in non-rigid objects. 
in this way, a structured light system coupled to a customsmart camera 
will be used. the main objective will be then to increase the 
flexibilities of the perception system by controlling the available dofs 
to improve  its accuracy and robustness. the perception capabilities of 
the system can be dynamically impacted by changing both its internal 
state (relative position between structured light and camera, focus ...) 
and its external state (spatial position of the whole system). for 
example, potential occlusion of the deformable surface can be avoided by 
positioning adequately the sensor apparatus. in addition, the camera 
systems or the processing accuracy can be managed (increased or 
decreased to manage the computational cost) by modifying the internal 
state of the perception system. sensor‐based control laws acting on the 
internal/external states of the perception system will be used to fit 
this goal."

more details about the phd subject:

curent visual simultaneous localisation an mapping (slam or vslam) 
algorithms have some shortcomings when they are applied to large scale 
environments. first the algorithmic complexity grows quadratically with 
the size of the map, and large scale maps are intractable. moreover, 
maps generated with slam or structure from motion (sfm) algorithms have 
some large scale drift coming from error accumulation.

however, in the case of mobile robot navigation, local maps are 
sufficient to allow autonomous navigation. large scale drift doesn't 
matter because the robot sensors can only see nearby landmarks. on the 
other hand, for tasks such as path planning, using the whole map is 
mandatory. the same is true for matching locations between the slam map 
and a geographical information system or an aerial image. in those 
cases, the map needs to be topologically correct. that means the 
transformation between the map and the real world should be bijective 
and bicontinuous. to achieve that, it is necessary to solve the well 
known problem of the loop closing.

the objective of this thesis will be to propose a slam system able to 
deal with the above mentioned difficulties. two main problems have to be 
adressed. first the representation of the map should be able to decouple 
the local geometry from large scale structure and topology. the map 
should be able to accept large scale deformations or loop closures with 
a low computational cost and without modifying the local geometry. the 
second problem to solve is the detection of loop closures. this can be 
done by combining 2d photometric information from images and 3d 
information from the local geometry."

safe active semantic visual mapping and navigation
------------------------------------
visual slam research has been focused in the ability to locate a camera 
with respect
to an a priory unknown scene, under very general conditions and reducing 
the assumptions
about the observed scene. the resulting map composed of geometric 
entities such as points
and edgeles, normally has a reduced capability to represent the scene.

in the proposed research it is assumed that the robot has rich knowledge 
about the scenes
being observed because the roboearth object database is available. the 
goal is to build a map composed
of traditional meaningless geometrical entities plus the recognized 
objects in the database,
resulting in a map where objects the robot has to interact with are 
precisely located.

the robot has to exploit the map information to plan the motions and 
safely navigate in order
to locate the objects needed for a given task

844,2010,post doc position,"postdoc position : real time reconstruction and tracking of flexible and 
deformable surfaces using vision and structured light. application to 
automatic bovine muscle cutting.

key words : computer vision, structured light, deformable surfaces 
reconstruction.

laboratoire des sciences et materiaux pour l'electronique et d'automatique
clermont ferrand - france

duration : 18 months.

the group gravir in lasmea (cnrs umr 6602) is a well known research 
group in the field automatic, vision and robotic. with the three 
scientific domains (perception systems, artificial vision, robotics and 
autonomous complex systems) gravir covers the needs in smart sensors, 
visual perception, vision based control and modeling/control of the 
complex system of the anr project arms (a multi arms robotic system for 
muscle separation).

we investigate the automation of bovine muscle and bone separation for 
the meat processing industry. the approach is to combine robotic control 
methods integrating smart and active vision sensors.
deformable models are widely used in the computer vision. their various 
adaptations always exhibit a trade-off between the computational 
efficiency and the genericity of models. fully generic models are able 
to recover arbitrarily shaped objects. as a counterpart, they always 
involve heavy computational costs which are directly related to the size 
of input images.
we aim to develop an active vision system able to perceive and track in 
the best conditions and in real time a deformable object. combining 
structured light with smart and fast capabilities of our high speed 
vision system, we want to develop a very efficient and robust 
application which can handle unexpected and rapidly varying situations 
of complex objects.
we investigate a free-form inference of the 3-d information about the 
world that can be extracted directly from image sequences taken from a 
moving camera. such inference can only succeed if certain assumptions 
are made, the standard being that the scene observed by the camera is 
rigid. recent studies on non-rigid surface reconstruction have 
demonstrated that it is possible, under certain viewing conditions, to 
infer the principal modes of deformation of an object alongside its 3-d 
shape within a structure from motion estimation framework. the aim is 
both to extend and improve existing methods and to apply them to the 
domain of the meat processing industry by taking into account the 
knowledge about physical properties of bovine muscles.

the candidate must be familiar with structure from motion and image 
processing techniques (ideally with the domain of deformable object 
reconstruction and tracking). c++ programming capabilities are also 
required.

tracking/following for outdoor automated vehicles.  this is a multi-year
effort working with a pittsburgh company interested in licensing
autonomous vehicle technologies developed at carnegie mellon.

candidates should have knowledge and practical experience with state
estimation theory including error modeling, derivation of filters, and
analysis/tuning of those filters.  for example, since we're using a

introduction:
recently a large number of bio-inspired computational methods have been used 
(also called methods of natural computing) to solve computationally hard 
problems in many domains. these methods have proven to be successful for 
different types of problems with unknown and uncertain data where the 
traditional approaches are not so effective. it is estimated that the biological 
life that evolved during millions of years will be a fruitful source of 
inspiration for the development of new computational methods offer in the years 
to come and they will represent an important research direction in the 
artificial intelligence mainstream.
 
objective of the special issue:
from a practical perspective, an essential research direction is represented by 
the development of highly complex systems (usually agent-based) that 
intelligently solve problems of very high difficulty. we consider complex 
systems composed from a large number of components (agents) capable to make 
specialized computations in the problem space. such developments are usually 
composed of a very large number of computational components, who interact many 
times nonlinearly, forming as a whole a complex problem solving system. a 
subclass of complex systems includes the hybrid systems composed from different 
type of artificial components capable to make computations, and human 
specialists that could interact in different points of decisions during the 
problems solving. research related to complex systems address analysis of many 
aspects such as complexity, self-organization, emergence, intelligence, 
hybridization and so forth. many computational complex systems developments 
require interdisciplinary approaches, which must include methods developed in 
different sciences, like sub-domains of the artificial intelligence like natural 
computing and intelligent agents. 

 
a particular subject by interest for this issue is represented by the 
self-organizing complex systems that use methods of natural computing in 
different tasks, like: problems solving, self-organization etc. this issue will 
centralize some state of the art results in the theme, which we estimate that 
will remain an important research direction in the near future.
 
recommended topics:
topics to be discussed in this special issue include (but are not limited to) 
the following:
 
·        artificial intelligence
·        large-scale and complex systems
·        hybrid complex systems
·        intelligent systems
·        natural computing
·        evolutionary systems
·        complex systems’modeling
·        agents and multi-agent systems
·        complex networks
·        difficult problem for a human specialist
·        difficult problem for a computational system
·        complex systems specialized in difficult problems solving
·        decision support systems
·        problem solving method used by a complex system
·        problems that could be solved by a complex system
·        large-scale cooperative agent-based systems 
·        self-organizing system 
 
submission procedure:
researchers and practitioners are invited to submit papers for this special 
theme issue on from natural computing to self-organizing intelligent complex 
systems on or before march  19, 2011. all submissions must be original and may
