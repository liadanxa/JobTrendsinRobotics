4,2005,"post-doc position available at inria rhone-alpes, grenoble (fr) - autonomous navigation in dynamic environments","----------------------
     post-doctoral proposal
     ----------------------

the inria e-motion research project-team at inria rhone-alpes is opening a
post-doctoral position in the field of:

       autonomous navigation in dynamic environments.



o subject description:

mobivip is a french research project whose purpose is to study, evaluate
and experiment technologies revolving around novel forms of transportation
systems based on ""public individual vehicles"" (see
http://www-sop.inria.fr/mobivip for more details).  public individual
vehicles are similar to their european counterparts, the cybercars (see
http://www.cybercars.org).

in this framework, the e-motion group of inria rhone-alpes addresses the
problem of automated driving in open and dynamic environments. an
environment is dynamic when it features moving objects and it is open when
full knowledge about it is not available beforehand (which is typically the
case of most real environments, in particular roadway-like environments).

the inria e-motion research project-team (formerly known as sharp) has a
long history in the field of motion autonomy.  it has been involved in a
number of french, european and international programmes and has
demonstrated in various occasions different autonomous driving skills with
real vehicles (parking, platooning, obstacle avoidance).  e-motion has
developed a number of techniques in fields as different as perception,
localisation, map building, motion planning, sensory-motor coupling and
reactive motion execution.

e-motion is currently exploring a motion planning scheme called ""partial
motion planning"" (pmp) whose purpose is to explicitly deal with the
constraints imposed by a dynamic environment, in particular the real-time
constraint imposed by the dynamicity of the environment: the motion planner
has a limited-time only to compute a motion.

given the intrinsic complexity of motion planning, fulfilling such a
real-time constraint is in general impossible to guarantee (even with the
most efficient randomised motion planners existing today).  one way to cope
cope with this issue is to compute a partial motion only, ie the best
partial motion given the time available.  in a way, pmp can be seen as a
compromise between pure motion planning and reactive approaches.

pmp, like reactive approaches, raises a safety issue: what guarantee do we
have that the robotic system will never find itself in a dangerous
situation yielding a collision in the future (this issue is critical in
dynamic environments).

to solve this problem, we believe that the concept of ""inevitable collision
states"" (ics) can be useful.  an ics is a state such that no matter what
the future trajectory of a robotic system is, it eventually collides with
an obstacles.  this concept is general and permits to take into account the
dynamics of both the robotic system and the moving objects.  clearly, for
its own safety, a robotic system should never be in one of these ics.

a first version of the pmp algorithm has been developed and implemented on
the experimental vehicle of the inria research unit located near paris (phd
of stephane petti).  the primary purpose of this post-doc position is to
integrate this algorithm onto the experimental vehicle of inria rhone-alpes
and then to further the work on pmp and ics so as to demonstrate the
validity of the overall concept on a real car-like vehicle.


o requirements (educational and technical background, knowledge of
  specific material):

  the experimental component of this post-doc will be significant.  it will
  involve a lot of development on the e-motion experimental platform, a
  cycab vehicle.  candidates should be motivated and definitely have a
  taste for this kind of work. former experience in real-time programming
  and control theory is a plus.

  mobivip being a french programme, fluency in french is very much welcomed
  (although not technically required).


o starting date: as early as possible (december 2005 would be great).


o duration: one year.


o wages: approximately 1800 euros per month, including standard health
   coverage.

""smartsystems""
international university bremen (iub)

http://www.eecs.iu-bremen.de/smartsystems/
***********************************************************************

as humans we can sense, act, speak, listen, decide and sometimes
understand.  the 21st century will witness technologies that can do the
same. we will see cars that negotiate with each other in order to
optimize traffic flow. our t-shirts may have their own internet
addresses and tell the manufacturer if they are only rarely worn.
in addition to their well-established role as programmable
machine-tools, robots are also more and more used in domains where
some autonomy and intelligence is necessary. they work under conditions
where the robot is not constantly supervised by a human operator and
where it has to be adaptive as its developer can not fully predict which
situations it will encounter in its application environment.

we all know future descriptions of this kind; we also know that they
are no longer science fiction, although real future may still look
quite differently. but whatever route the future takes, it will be
scientists and engineers who help in shaping it. they will develop
systems (yet unthinkable) that could likewise be described as robots,
user interfaces, web agents, enhanced reality or personal assistants.

the international university bremen (iub) takes part in this rapidly
growing, boldly interdisciplinary enthe intelligent autonomous systems lab
(http://www.ualr.edu/cxye/laboratory.htm) at the university of arkansas at
little rock has an open ph.d. research positions in mobile robotics. the
applicant is expected to work in mobile robot navigation in unstructured
environments. we are particularly interested in the following areas: (1)
mobile robot localization and mapping in unstructured environments, (2) 3-d
range data processing and understanding for autonomous navigation, and (3)
machine learning for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. 

the ideal candidate should hold a degree in electrical engineering, computer
science, or related fields. she or he should have good background in
control, computer vision or statistical machine learning. excellent
programming skills in c/c++ are required. experience with programming in
linux operating system is a plus.

general guideline of admission to graduate study at the university is
referred to the graduate student handbook
(http://dynamic.appsci.ualr.edu/index_flash.html). the university of
arkansas at little rock is a dynamic metropolitan university locating at the
state's capital city, little rock (http://www.littlerock.com

of application outlining qualifications for the position, along with their
detailed cv to dr. cang ye (cxye at ualr.edu).
