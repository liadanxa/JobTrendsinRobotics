- post-doc position in:

  human-swarm games: interaction and cooperation between human players and
                                     robot swarms in game scenarios

- start date and duration: february 2013, 1 year

- location: ""dalle molle"" institute for artificial intelligence (idsia),
                lugano, switzerland (http://ww.idsia.ch) and
        lsro1 lab, eplf, lausanne, switzerland (http://lsro1.epfl.ch/)


mission:
----------------

the main objective of the research is the study of strategies and
modalities to let humans and
heterogeneous multi-robot systems (hereafter referred to as swarms)
interacting and teaming
up. physical gaming (i.e., games played by humans and robots together) will
be used as a context of
application and testing. gaming has an important role in people’s life,
providing tools for
entertainment, social interactions, and also contributing shaping cognitive
and sensory-motor
abilities. from a scientific/engineering point of view, it is well
understood that game scenarios are
particularly suitable to study robot(s)-robot(s) and human-robot(s)
interaction in both cooperative
and adversarial settings. the use of a gaming context has the advantage of
letting the designer
define limits for time, place, and rules.

by exploiting these properties, the researcher will develop general
strategies for mutual
interaction and cooperation between humans and robots, with a particular
focus on the issues of
mutual trust, mutual learning, and two-ways, multi-modal communication for
sharing information and
providing commands and hints. the researcher will identify and implement
various schemes for
heterogeneous teaming and playing, in opposition and in cooperation, and
always with humans in the
loop. particular attention will be focused on how a swarm can give guidance
and hints to humans to
optimize team’s utility.

considered the importance of gaming in children’s life, the research will
mainly focus on children
as human players, addressing educational, developmental, and entertainment
issues. one of the
central, practical aims of the research is to design and implement one or
more interactive game
scenarios, based on the integration of multiple and heterogeneous robotic
resources, sensory data
(visual, speech, motion), and children players.


candidate profile:
----------------------

the candidate must hold a ph.d. and possibly have, at least, 1-year
experience as a post-doc. she/he
must have excellent scientific records, be highly motivated, and have a
strong background and research
expertise in the following domains:

 * robotics
 * multi-robot/swarm systems
 * design and implementation of game scenarios and systems
 * acquisition and processing of multi-modal data based on visual, speech,
and other forms of input.

scientific experience in social robotics and/or in children psychology will
be an important
advantage, as well as a good familiarity with machine learning techniques
and distributed
algorithms. she/he is expected to have outstanding mathematical and
programming skills (in c/c++,
and preferably in linux environments), and to have a positive attitude
toward interdisciplinary
research and teamwork.


time frame and additional information
----------------------------------------------

 * deadline for submission of applications: january 31, 2013

 * duration of the fellowship: 1 year, possibly starting from february 2013

1634,2013,"robotics engineer position in paris, france","the isir (paris, france) is seeking a robotics/mechanical engineer for developing mobile, wheel-legged robots. the position is available immediatly.

thanks to a recently awarded grant, our team is developing innovative algorithms to allow robots to adapt autonomously to unforeseen situations (mechanical failures, radical changes of the ground surface, etc.). in the framework of this project, we are seeking a robotic engineer who will have in charge the design of new wheel-legged hybrid robots. this includes proposing mechanical solutions, cad design, basic electronic design and interface with the ros ``meta operating system''.

the ideal candidate will have a passion for robotics and beautifully designed robots. he will work closely with one associate professor, one phd. student and one post-doc.

this is a one-year, full-time position starting in february/march 2013.

* requirements
- ms in robotics (or french engineering school), mechatronics or equivalent field
- demonstrated ability to design a full robot, from cad design to interface with a computer

* details
please submit a resume, a cover letter and any supporting material (e.g. photos of designed robots) to mouret at isir.upmc.fr. documents can be in french or in english.


* about the lab
our group is focused on adaption and cognition for robots. it is part of the isir (institute for robotics and intelligent systems), one of the main robotics department in france, which is in the university pierre and marie curie (upmc). we are located in the center of paris, france. 


* about the project
the creadapt project aims at harnessing both the creative and the adaptive abilities of evolutionary algorithms to power software that can autonomously and creatively adapt the behavior of robots to unforeseen situations. in the typical scenario, a mobile robot faces a situation that requires adaptation (e.g. a leg is broken or the ground surface changed). the robot launches a few experiments to investigate the situation; after a few minutes it should be able to cope with the new situation to pursue its mission until a new adaption is required. our new algorithms will be demonstrated on wheel-legged hybrid robots because these robots can move in many different ways.

theme 1:
event-driven vision: developing bio-inspired vision systems for the humanoid robot icub
smart vision sensors, instead of merely reproducing with high accuracy the visual scene, are capable of transducing the sensory signal in a way best suited to extract relevant information for behaviour. to build such types of sensors, a growing community is taking inspiration from biological perceptive systems that show performance so far unreachable by artificial sensory systems. mapping the characteristics of biological sensory perception onto artificial systems allows them to be inherently capable of better performances and, at the same time, be compact, low power, low cost, robust to noise and capable of adapting to ever changing working conditions, making these products suitable for real world real time applications. the ""neuromorphic"" icub is equipped with one of such smart sensors, the dynamic vision sensor [1], that asynchronously sends information about scene changes. the use of bio-inspired sensors on such a sophisticated robotic platform allows for the development of dynamic tasks where the robot interacts with the environment. this short project aims at developing event-based algorithms based on the output of the dvs sensor, to guide the behavior of the robot in selected demonstrators.
the performance of the humanoid robot icub, equipped with the newly developed vision system, will assess quality and advantages of the method.
the successful candidate holds a phd degree in computer science, robotics or similar and a background in artificial vision.

theme 2:
hierarchical inverse dynamics position/force control of floating-base constrained robots
floating-base robots (e.g. humanoid robots, walking robots) are a well-known class of underactuated systems, so they are not feedback linearizable as standard industrial manipulator. for this reason, the control of floating-base robots is still nowadays a challenging and active research field. this short-term project will focus on the derivation and implementation of a control framework for floating-base robots. in particular, the test platform is going to be the highly redundant humanoid robot icub. following the latest ideas of analytical dynamics and inverse dynamics control, we want to devise a computationally efficient software for multi-task position-force control. in particular we are interested in a scenario in which the robot has to balance and reach with one of its hands (extending some of our previous work). the robot could also make contact with the environment, to extend its reachable workspace, so force control has to be addressed. requirements: the candidate should have a strong background in analytical dynamics and c++ programming. a good knowledge of control theory is also expected.

theme 3:
human detection for face-to-face human robot interaction
recent research in robotics is trying hard to push robots out of factories and research laboratories. effective operation in everyday environment requires the ability to detect humans and interact with them. most of the successful vision-based strategies for people/pedestrial localization are tuned for ""at distance"" scenario (see (dollar, wojek et al. 2012) for a review) and are not well suited for ""face-to-face"" human robot interaction scenarios. initial approaches for egocentric vision attempt mainly to infer the social environment where humans move (fathi, li et al. 2012; park, jain et al. 2012) and rely on face detection and orientation estimation. this information only allows performing simple inference about the social interaction in the scene and it loses almost all the information about actions which are mainly conveyed by limb motion. in more complex cases, where also the type of actions has to be inferred (e.g. pointing, grasping etc.), the egocentric vision algorithm has to also estimate the localisation and orientation of limbs. this problem is not yet efficiently solved in unconstrained scenarios with egocentric vision-like sensors. this project will be performed on the icub robot (metta, sandini et al. 2008), with the aim to implement efficient tools for the detection of human body parts from the cameras in the head of the robot. we will develop new methodologies for detecting human body parts at close distance such has torso, arms and face (i.e. upper body). the input data will be the disparity and optical flow maps obtained from the stereo pair embedded in the robotic head as well the raw color images from the cameras. we will also consider using kinematic models to improve localization.

this project will be carried out within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis). the ideal candidate should have background in computer vision and/or machine learning. he should also have computer programming skills and be motivated to work on a robotic platform.

theme 4:
reaching along with whole-body balancing through real-time nonlinear constrained optimization
over the recent years, research on humanoid robotics has been giving an increasing attention to the problem of whole-body coordination. indeed, as hardware components get constantly and quickly upgraded for bipedal platforms such as asimo, hrp4, icub, new theories and control frameworks are conceived to let humanoids behave safely during interaction in human environments. in this context, the purpose of the short-term project is to enhance the motor capabilities of the icub robot, currently available for the reaching tasks, by incorporating a balancing system which will allow maintaining the upright posture on the legs in a scenario where the robot will perform complex bending movements with the upper-body limbs to attain far objects. in particular, a methodology that has been lately demonstrated to be effective in dealing with highly redundant structures makes use of state-of-the-art optimizers that can solve online for a given kinematic task, subject to a set of nonlinear constraints. the objective would be therefore to extend this approach including force/torque measurements and real-time control design to account for the robot dynamics and meet the balancing requirement.
requirements: the candidate should have a strong background in control theory and software engineering. knowledge of nonlinear optimization techniques would be beneficial.giorgio metta <giorgio.metta at iit.it>

     ""planning and acting in robotics"" 

is being offered at 

               laas-cnrs, university of toulouse, france

for the fall 2013, under the joint supervision of felix ingrand and malik ghallab.

this subject is at the intersection of ai and robotics. its objective is to explore and further develop in a systematic way the hierarchization approach to deliberation, from planning of abstract tasks to the triggering concrete commands. a first step is to study planning methods such as hierarchical task network (htn) and angelic hierarchical planning (ahp), and to extend them towards the needs of deliberate action in robotics. htns offer a convenient representation and practical algorithms beyond classical planning assumptions [1]. ahps follow a novel and promising approach for hierarchical planning with bonding techniques of reachable sets of states [2]. both approaches need however to be extended for the purpose of this project along several dimensions, among which:
• opportunistic and context dependent refinement techniques for htn and/or ahp, integrating execution control, supervision and plan revision mechanisms at various levels.
• durative actions with explicit time and temporal constraints between actions and exogenous events,
• uncertainty with different levels of inaccuracy and non-determinism at the different refinement levels,
• continuous and hybrid state variables and action variables along a hierarchy corresponding to the refinement hierarchy.
an important issue in this approach is to clarify what needs to be synthesized on-line in order to deal with new missions and environments, what can be synthesized off-line, parameterized and reused on-line for handling stable robot capabilities. htn, ahp and other planning techniques can be developed for performing these syntheses.
another concern to be taken into account is how to specify or acquire the environment and the robots models needed by planning and acting. ideas such as “compiling down” frequently performed tasks from a computationally expensive process into lower level skills and commands may be considered.

the research topics of the phd will cover one or several of the above scientific issues of deliberate actions in robotics, with conceptual and theoretical contributions as well as experimental validations. the latter will be deployed on one of the indoor robot platforms of laas, in particular on the pr2 robot.
the work will be carried out mainly within the ris group at laas-cnrs. this group is involved with partnerships with several robotics and ai labs in the world. one or several internships abroad during the thesis remain possible.

phd advisors: felix ingrand felix at laas.fr and malik ghallab malik at laas.fr

application (cv, motivation letter, relevant papers/master thesis in pdf) from students holding or

the organization

farm technology group
the farm technology group is part of wageningen university and embedded in the plant sciences group of wageningen ur. the farm technology group aims at enhancing, exploiting and disseminating technology in primary agricultural production processes with the aim to fulfil the needs of mankind and nature in a sustainable way. this mission is achieved by combining knowledge, methodology and tools from technical sciences with biological, environmental, agricultural and social sciences in order to study, understand, manage and design biosystems. the group covers arable farming, (greenhouse) horticulture and livestock farming and variations and mixtures of these application domains as they emerge in response to challenges posed by moving towards a more bio-based economy. typical research instruments and expertise in our field include sensor technology, data analysis, systems analysis, continuous time and discrete time modelling, systems engineering, integral systems design, systems optimization and management and control of production processes, robotics and precision agriculture techniques.

the world is facing interesting challenges in the years to come: a growing population that needs to be fed, less people interested in working in agriculture, limited natural resources (e.g. fertilizers) and a growing concern about the environment (e.g. chemical crop protection). robots and (semi-)autonomous systems are an option for addressing these challenges, by supporting and replacing human labour and performing operations in a more directed and precise way (precision agriculture). the past 15 years, wageningen ur / the farm technology group has built up an extensive and unique portfolio in agro-robotics ranging from autonomous harvesting machines for horticulture to precision weed control in arable farming. as sensing (e.g. computer vision) is a well-established field of expertise within wageningen ur, we now wish to expand our agro-robotics work in the direction of 'intelligence' and high-level control.

more information about the farm technology group can be found on www.wageningenur.nl\fte
wageningen university & research centre
delivering a substantial contribution to the quality of life. that's our focus – each and every day. within our domain, healthy food and living environment, we search for answers to issues affecting society – such as sustainable food production, climate change and alternative energy. of course, we don’t do this alone. every day, 6,500 people work on ‘the quality of life’, turning ideas into reality, on a global scale.

1709,2013,2 phd studentships in cognitive vision/robotics,"2 phd studentships in cognitive vision/robotics school of computing university of leeds uk

two phd studentships are available funded by a new eu grant, strands:
spatial-temporal representations and activities for cognitive control in long-term scenarios. leeds is a partner in this multi site project, and is particularly concerned with developing appropriate qualitative spatio-temporal representations and with learning activity models in a long term temporal setting. the other partners in the consortium are the universities of birmingham (coordinating node), lincoln, vienna, rwth aachen, and  kth stockholm.

strands aims to enable a robot to achieve robust and intelligent behaviour in human environments through adaptation to, and the exploitation of, long-term experience. our approach is based on understanding 3d space and how it changes over time, from milliseconds to months. we will develop novel approaches to extract quantitative and qualitative spatio-temporal structure from sensor data gathered during months of autonomous operation. extracted structure will include reoccurring geometric primitives, objects, people, and models of activity. we will also develop control mechanisms which exploit these structures to yield adaptive behaviour in highly demanding, real-world security and care scenarios.

the spatio-temporal dynamics presented by such scenarios (e.g. humans moving, furniture changing position, objects (re-)appearing) are largely treated as anomalous readings by state-of-the-art robots. errors introduced by these readings accumulate over the lifetime of such systems, preventing many of them from running for more than a few hours. by autonomously modelling spatio-temporal dynamics, our robots will be able run for significantly longer than current systems. our systems will take these opportunities, advancing long-term mapping, life-long learning about objects, person tracking, human activity recognition and self-motivated behaviour generation. we will integrate our advances into complete cognitive systems to be deployed and evaluated at two end-user sites. the tasks these systems will perform are impossible without long-term adaptation to spatio-temporal dynamics, yet they are tasks demanded by early adopters of cognitive robots. 

the two studentships on the four year strands integrated project funded by an
eu framework 7 grant are available immediately. 

successful applicants will be paid a stipend which will be sufficient for them to pay their own fees at the appropriate rate, leaving sufficient left over for maintenance at the uk epsrc rate.

each of the two studentships is funded for 3 years and covers fees (at the international rate if necessary) and maintenance at the standard epsrc rate (currently £xyz per annum).

candidates should have or expect to obtain a first class or good 2.1 honours degree in mathematics, computer science or artificial intelligence. preference will be given to candidates who can offer a masters level qualification, a track record in publications, or relevant experience.

this post offers an outstanding opportunity to work with a 
multidisciplinary team of researchers. our long-term vision is to create 
the first non-biological living system through evolution in the natural 
world. the project takes arguably a radical approach: creating living 
systems by synthesising their building blocks from scratch. the research 
programme will study evo-bots, which are energy-autonomous mobile robots 
/ mechatronic modules. evo-bots control when to move; however, their 
direction of motion is entirely dictated by the environment. by 
controlling how evo-bots physically interact with each other (a process 
called self-assembly), the system can give rise to novel forms of life 
and its evolution.

the post holder will be working in dr roderich gross' natural robotics 
lab (http://naturalrobotics.group.shef.ac.uk). the lab is part of the 
sheffield centre for robotics (http://www.scentro.ac.uk), which offers a 
brand-new robotics laboratory of ca. 800 sq m.

francesco mondada's group at epfl (swiss federal institute of 
technology), lausanne, switzerland. http://mobots.epfl.ch/

applicants should have a good honours degree, hold, or be near 
completion of, a phd (or equivalent research experience) in a related 
discipline such as robotics, mechatronics, electrical engineering, 
mechanical engineering, or computer science, and have a track record of 
research and publications in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. the 
successful applicant will have knowledge in system design, rapid 
prototyping, embedded computing, sensors and their processing, actuators 
and their control and have good overall it skills. previous research 
experience in the design, implementation and study of miniature 
robotic/mechatronic systems is highly desirable.

the post is fixed-term from 1 june 2013 to 1 august 2014.

salary in the range: £28,685 to £30,424 per annum

control of a flotilla of robotized surface vehicles for towing of wrecks,
icebergs, platforms or large dimension flotsams.the work to be achieved
consists in modeling the system composed of the vehicle(s), the cable(s) and
the load(s), defining some optimal reference trajectories (energy
minimization and obstacle avoidance), and proposing control schemes for
trajectory tracking. furthermore, in order to avoid degradation in the
performance of the controlled system during the task, the vehicle is
expected to possess self tuning abilities and in order to compensate for
different kinds of disturbances and variable operating conditions.
therefore, the phd candidate should propose and implement not only the
environmental parameters’ estimations (intensity and frequency of waves,
intensity and direction of wind, etc), but also the adaptive control schemes
that enable reference trajectories tracking despite a wide range of
variation of the towed load. the effect of the cables on the system will
also be taken into account in this study by means of accurate modeling of
their dynamics.once the control schemes are implemented, they will first be
validated in simulation (matlab/simulink software environment) and then in
real-time on an experimental platform to show their effectiveness and
robustness.the candidate should have a master degree (or equivalent) in
automatic control, in robotics, or in a closely related area, preferably
with a focus in automatic control and robotics. she/he is expected to have
good skills in control and robotics as well as in simulation and programming
(matlab, simulink, c/c++, etc). a good background in mechanics, marine
robotics, and signal processing would be greatly appreciated.application:
interested individuals should submit a detailed cv, a motivation letter and
possibly recommendation letters to the contact persons indicated above.

position in robotics at the centre for autonomous systems
(www.cas.kth.se) and computational vision and active perception lab (
www.csc.kth.se/cvap)

we are looking for a student who will investigate novel methods in
robotic grasping and manipulation. current approaches to robotic
manipulation are largely representing such actions in a discrete and
heuristic way. while currently even rigid object manipulation remains
challenging due to the presence of incomplete and noisy data, we are
particularly interested in developing novel continuous representations
which are invariant under certain classes of deformations, thus enabling
a robot to reason about deformable objects and/or classes of objects.

we are a leading lab pursuing this nascent area which is highly
interdisciplinary and which can benefit from ideas from probability
theory, riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. the candidate will
join the group of prof. danica kragic ( www.csc.kth.se/~danik/) and will
be co-supervised by dr. florian pokorny ( www.csc.kth.se/~fpokorny/).

this is a four-year time-limited position that can be extended up to a
year with the inclusion of a maximum of 20% departmental duties, usually
teaching.  doctoral students must be registered at kth. the starting
date is open for discussion, though ideally we would like the successful
candidate to start as soon as possible.

employment
----------

form of employment: time-limited
work time: full time
the salary follows the directions provided by kth
start date: according to agreement
number of positions: 1

qualifications
--------------

1797,2013,"phd position available: university of birmingham, uk, learning models of complex human behaviour","a phd position is available in the intelligent robotics laboratory 
(irlab) at the university of birmingham

this project is part of an fp7 project called strands 
(http://www.strands-project.eu/), involving 30+ people, of whom a team 
of 6 work at the birmingham irlab 
(http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/robotics/). in the overall 
project we investigate the task a robot that must perform 4d mapping. by 
this we mean producing not just a map of space (3d mapping), but also of 
the activities that occur within that space.  such activity maps are 
necessary for robots to act within a space shared with humans.

the activities performed in an environment by many humans over a period 
of time can typically be viewed as being composed of many smaller 
complex events and interactions. many of these events occur 
periodically. there are differences across repetitions. the challenge of 
this phd is how to recognise and exploit this periodicity in order to 
build compact models of complex behaviour involving multiple humans over 
long timescales (hours and days). the work will consider how the 
ordering and frequency of sub-events can be learned, taking account of 
the fact that sometimes particular sub-events may not occur, or that 
their ordering may be changed.

the irlab at birmingham is a leading european lab working in many 
aspects of intelligent robotics. the group has five faculty, seven 
research fellows and fifteen research students. the lab has a state of 
the art equipment with access to a wide range of advanced platforms for 
mobility and manipulation.

you should have a batchelors or masters in computer science, electronic 
engineering, mathematics or physics. you should have excellent 
mathematical and coding skills. you will have graduated in the top 5% of 
your class.

in the first instance contact jeremy wyatt and nick hawes

acquisition with robots"" at the semantic computing group, bielefeld 
university/citec ===

the semantic computing group [1] at the university of bielefeld/citec 
[2,3] has one open research position on the topic ""embodied models of 
language acquisition with robots"".

the goal of the project is to develop an embodied model of language 
acquisition that can be implemented on a robot platform with 
state-of-the-art manipulation capabilities.

the goal is to develop i) a formalism for the representation of action 
that can be used to ground the semantics of verbal constructions in 
natural language as well as ii) learning algorithms by which such 
representations ""emerge"" in interaction with a human tutor that guides 
the learner by demonstrating actions while verbally describing them.one 
important goal will be to develop memory models by which a robot can 
learn the invariant essential properties of actions by contrasting and 
abstracting from specific situations. the sub-project is part of a 
larger project involving six other researchers and several principal 
investigators from citec. the candidate will be expected to collaborate 
with all the other sub-projects towards meeting the goal of developing a 
larger demonstrator showing how robots can learn to familiarize 
themselves with objects in interaction with a human tutor.

the successful candidate is expected to have a strong background in at 
least two of the following areas:

- cognitive robotics

- cognitive linguistics

- machine learning

- computer vision

- computational linguistics


candidates with expertise in several topics will be given preference.  
applicants are expected to have strong programming skills, the ability 
to work independently, strong interpersonal skills as well as strong 
english language skills. candidates should be qualified for and willing 
to perform state-of-the-art research. knowledge of german is not required.

the group will provide the chance to perform cutting-edge research in an 
international context. applicants for a postdoc position will have the 
chance to perform independent research on the topics of the group that 
qualifies them for an academic career and allows them to position 
themselves as independent researchers in the community. phd applicants 
will receive supervision and support in developing the necessary skills 
to produce high-quality research necessary to earn a phd degree.

the salary for both phd and postdoc positions is around  3.300 euro per 
month (pre taxes), according to scale tv-l e 13 in the german university 
system and can vary depending on age, marital status, tax class etc. the 
salary increases with the duration of the employment. an online tool to 
calculate the post-tax income can be found at [4] (indicating e-13).

bielefeld is one of the 20 largest cities in germany (with close to 
330.000 inhabitants) [5]. it is a lively city with a lot of cultural and 
entertainment opportunities (see [6]). it is located in the heart of the 
teutoburg forest [7], offering many opportunities for outdoor and 
leisure activities.

the position is available for two years and can be prolonged for one 
more year. candidates are expected to start on october 1st, 2013.

applications are invited until july 28th and will be processed as they 
are received. interviews will be scheduled via skype in the first week

1837,2013,"phd/postdoc position on “incremental coordination of human-robot interaction” at citec, bielefeld university","the excellence cluster on cognitive interaction technology (citec) [1] 
in cooperation with the research institute for cognition and robotics 
(cor-lab) [2] at bielefeld university [3], germany has one open 
phd/postdoc position on ""incremental coordination of multi-modal 
perception and action in human-robot interaction"". the position (tv-l 
e13) is part of an interdisciplinary project on the topic of 
interactional coordination in hri funded by citec.

the interaction of lay users with autonomous robot systems is nowadays 
still rather cumbersome due to the fact that interactive robots feature 
limited capabilities of coordinating their actions with those of the 
human user to achieve mutual understanding. the goal of this project is 
to conduct research on architectural concepts for autonomous robots 
facilitating fine-grained interactional coordination with humans. this 
requires the development of a coordination model based on the robot’s 
permanent monitoring of the human’s multimodal conduct, incremental 
processing of perception as well as incremental action generation, the 
realization of repair strategies for human-robot interaction and 
empirically based perception-action loops. the position will target the 
development of the required coordination model based on a rich 
repertoire of existing perceptual and action modules, e.g., for person 
tracking, speaker localization, focus of attention recognition or 
incremental text-to-speech production. the successful candidate develops 
architectural concepts for interactive robotic systems facilitating 
incremental processing of multi-modal perceptual cues and generation of 
communicative actions exploiting context-dependent priors on the 
behavior of human interaction partners.

the candidate is expected to collaborate with the interdisciplinary 
project partners on the analysis and experimental targets of the overall 
project and shall lead the development of the experimental robot systems 
developed in the project. the project aims at conducting experimental 
studies in a museum guide context at the kunsthalle bielefeld [4]. the 
primary robotics platform used in the project will be the nao robot by 
aldebaran robotics.

qualifications

the successful candidate is expected to have a strong background in at 
least two of the following areas:

- human-robot interaction
- pattern recognition
- computer vision
- robot architectures
- systems engineering

candidates with expertise in several topics will be given preference.  
applicants are expected to have strong programming skills (preferably 
c++, java, matlab), experience with robotics frameworks (ros, rsb, 
naoqi, orocos), the ability to work independently, openness for 
interdisciplinary collaboration as well as strong english language 
skills. knowledge of german is not required.

the position is embedded in the ""cognitive systems engineering"" research 
group [5] within cor-lab and citec at bielefeld university. citec and 
cor-lab provide a unique environment to perform cutting-edge research in 
an international context. applicants for a postdoc position will have 
the chance to perform independent research on the topics of the group 
that qualifies them for an academic career and allows them to position 
themselves as independent researchers in the community. phd applicants 
will receive extended supervision and support through the collaboration 
with the project partners at cor-lab and citec, in particular dr. karola 
pitsch (interactional linguistics) [6] and prof. franz kummert (applied 
informatics) [7].

the salary for both phd and postdoc positions is according to scale tv-l 
e 13 in the german university system and can vary depending on age, 
marital status, tax class etc. the salary increases with the duration of 
the employment. an online tool to calculate the post-tax income can be 
found at [8] (indicating e-13).

developing cognitive maps from virtual objects: exploiting spatial abilities through tactile serious games 

tutors

dr. luca brayda and prof. gabriel baud bovy 

job description

assistive technology attempts to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. in the case of sensory impairments such as blindness, systems able to assess and exploit spatial abilities using electronic devices are proposed as effective experimental setups, but very few of them are used in current rehabilitation procedures, or are present on the market [1]. the problem is generally in how and how much information can be conveyed on alternative sensory channels. one of the contexts where visually impaired people would most benefit from an assistive device is internet navigation: there, textual information is delivered through either braille or voice output, but the content linked to images and icons is very difficult to be decoded [2]. globally, web pages are organized for sighted people in logical structures tailored on sight, and whether the same structures should be used for blind subjects is not known. the use of virtual objects perceivable through touch has recently been proposed as a possible solution to the problem [3]. within the context of the iit multidisciplinary digeye project, we have shown that blind and sighted subjects seem to develop similar identifiable exploration strategies [4] and similar brain patterns [5] when touching virtual objects while attempting to form a mental spatial representation (known as 'cognitive map' [6]). however, it is still unknown which 'dictionary' of tactile elements may increase mapping performances, and how much rich the tactile information needs to be [7,8].

the objective of this phd program is twofold: first, to design a dictionary of virtual tactile objects able to quickly elicit the development of cognitive maps, under the constraint of a limited tactile information mainly localized under the fingertip [8]; second, to assess how the dictionary can be helpful in evaluating in measurable ways the spatial abilities of sighted and sensory impaired individuals, with the creation of serious games. 

this project is multidisciplinary: the phd candidate will carry out an autonomous work, however closely assisted by a team of mechanical and computer science engineers. (s)he will also be in touch with scientists active in cognition, neuroscience, and robotics. the direct contact with rehabilitation centers for visually impaired subjects, who will be the final beneficiaries of this research, will provide precious feedback. 
results of this research can help in understanding how to improve spatial abilities of sensory deprived individuals, both in rehabilitation contexts and information/entertainment systems. 
ultimately, this project will be important to validate and participate in user-centered design of new assistive devices currently built in rbcs. therefore, the hardware and software solutions output from the project are planned to be commercially exploitable. 


requirements

the candidate for this position must have either a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences, or alternatively a degree in psychology, with proven background in programming toolboxes (matlab, r). expertise in virtual reality, assistive technology and haptics is highly appreciated but optional

1868,2013,iit phd position in exploration haptic sensation,"exploration of haptic sensation and its use in detecting peripheral neuropathy
development of a novel touch based gripper for detecting peripheral neuropathy

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella
touch and related capabilities, such as kinaesthesia, are probably the most underrated human abilities. most researches, in fact, have concentrated on the visual and audio aspects of the sensory systems, but touch in daily life plays a fundamental role in all our actions; losing part of this sensitivity causes a problem in accomplishing even simple tasks. moreover, nowadays, the touch is widely used to screen neurological diseases. improving the accuracy, sensitivity and repeatability of the physical inspections would improve the recognition of such peripheral neuropathies. the core of this proposal is to determine a simple and objective (above all not influenced by the doctor skill and experience) test that highlights the patient diseases (as dysfunction of the recurrent pyramidal circuit, neuromuscular junction, primary motor neuron diseases, etc.). one of the straightforward connections between the brain and the environment is the motor cortex (cxm1) which controls complex movements by activation of the motor neurons. thus, the idea is to simulate the healthy human grasping by building a human upper limb model (with its tactile sensor feedback) controlled by a network structure of the primary motor cortex model. till now there have been numerous theories attempting to explain such sequence of operations in terms of a variety of motor control models; in fact, the accomplishment of a movement is a rather complex task: the simplest movement as pointing a given point in the space requires a non-trivial sequence of operations. another point is that a realistic model should be able to encode and decode the ascending tactile signals; moreover, considering the tactile feedback, the model must be bidirectional brain-muscle-brain. in the last decades, there have been several successful results in linking the information flow from neural cells to fingertip tactile sensitivity and arm movements: in lukashin  et al. (lukashin 1996) the movement of an arm was accomplished by six independent muscles governed by an artificial neural network model which input layer received spikes of single cell recordings; cisek et al. (cisek 1998) proposed a model of the cortical-spinal circuitry designed to cope with a wide range of movements in linking the information from neural cells to movements: gerling et al. (gerling 2013) modeled a 3d finite element fingertip linking all the previous models of touch: skin mechanics to neural firing rate, neural dynamics to action potential elicitation and mechanoreceptor populations to psychophysical discrimination; bologna et al. (bologna 2013) modeled the fine touch with peripheral-to-central neurotransmission closed loop.
the novelty of this work is to reproduce the two human fingers grasping with a network structure of the primary motor cortex model that controls the upper limb model (with its tactile sensor feedback). thus, the aim is to build a robotic arm (fingertip-hand-arm-brain) with not only the same structure (skin, bones, muscles, tendons, etc.), but, above all, with the same neurological system (mechanoreceptors, proprioceptors, brain cells, etc.) of human upper limb. this arm simulator will be able to reproduce the kinematic behaviour of a healthy human arm and it will serve as reference for further comparison with ill people; in valente et al. (valente 2012) a reference scale for peripheral neuropathy was established. by building a close-loop brain-arm-brain, the project aims to setup a realistic simulation environment able to improve medical doctors' diagnosis (e.g. brain diseases can be tested altering the circuit).
the work is divided in three parts: the first part is about assembling several test rigs for collecting the experimental data to determine the mechanical properties, kinematic characteristics and the parameters for models. the second one will concern the building of a real time kinematic simulation of fingertip, hand, forearm and arm 3d finite element/multibody models with acquired data based on 3d virtual visualization and validation with experimental data. the third part consists in designing the physical robotic simulator.
this activity will evolve along different research paths in collaboration with the neuroscience and brain technologies department (with thierry nieus) and the cnr of palermo (with michele migliore) as well as with other research centers in europe (université pierre et marie curie of paris with angelo arleo).
the successful candidate is expected to have an excellent background in mathematical modelling. knowledge of mechanics, computer science, biomedical measurements, statistics, electronics and control are also required. basic knowledge of neuroscience is considered as a plus.

cell signaling pathways as biological implementation of these probabilistic
gates. in turn, the key features of biochemical processes give new insights
for innovative probabilistic hardware implementation. we propose to
associate conventional electronics and novel stochastic nano-devices to
build the required hardware elements. combining them will lead to new
artificial information processing systems, which could, in the future,
outperform classical computers in tasks involving a direct interaction with
the physical world. for these purposes, the bambi project associates
research in bayesian probability theory, molecular biology, nanophysics,
computer science and electronics.

mapas sematicos visuales para escenas rigidas y no rigidas.
semantic visual mapping for rigid and non-rigid scenes.
main researcher j.m. martínez montiel

recent research is showing that computing medium-scale visual maps for 
rigid scenes in real time is
feasible. current maps, composed of a sparse set of points, are adequate 
for accurate camera
location, but quite poor for performing high-level tasks such as robot 
navigation, object manipulation
or human-computer interaction. furthermore, most available techniques 
are intensive in computer
requirements, being beyond the reach of small mobile devices.
our fundamental goal is to conduct cutting-edge research to push the 
limits of current visual mapping
techniques. more specifically, we propose to:
1. develop more efficient and robust techniques, able to build 
semi-dense maps (in the order of
thousands of points) for medium-scale environments. we will build a 
working demonstrator of a
distributed keyframe-based mapping and relocation system, where a light 
tracking process runs
on a small mobile computer, while the more expensive map optimization 
and storage can be
allocated on a separate machine, or as a service on the cloud.
2. develop scene understanding methods that boost the semantic contents 
of the map: object
recognition and insertion in the map, scene layout estimation, and scene 
recognition. we also
plan to address long-term mapping and apply learning techniques to 
determine which pieces of
information are obsolete or ephemeral and which are trustworthy for 
place recognition and
camera relocation.
3. research new computer vision methods able to deal with sequences of 
non-rigid scenes. our
specific approach is to embed finite element methods (fem) within the 
mapping algorithms in
order to exploit the rich models available from solid mechanics. we will 
target semi-dense
feature maps but also dense surface maps by exploiting variational 
methods and general-
purpose computing on graphics processing units (gpgpu).
4. perform extensive validation of all developed algorithms with real 
imagery in indoor and outdoor
environments. in the case of non-rigid methods, medical imagery coming 
from real live tissue is
targeted. a close interaction with surgeons and researchers in elastic 
models for biological
tissues is planned to achieve results that are significant in real 
surgical applications.

this is an ambitious proposal rooted on the strong published 
contributions of the research team to
the current state of the art in visual mapping, and the solid experience 
in building real-time mapping
demonstrators, which have fostered an intense technology transfer.

project summary

teams of robots for logistics, maintenance and environment 
monitoring(teloman)""(dpi2012-32100)

the research project involves deployment and actuation techniques of a 
multi-robot team. it is necessary to address problems of task planning 
and allocation, coordinated execution of the navigation, perception of 
the environment from multiple views from each of the team members, 
maintaining communication between all system components -- robots, 
infrastructure, bridges, monitoring equipment, etc. this project will 
address new goals and challenges for research and their application in 
real, large and complex scenarios. the research objectives are:

/- perception, learning and monitoring of the environment./to obtain a 
robust description of the type of environments where the robots are 
going to work, multisensor odometry techniques will be developed, which 
will integrate various devices onboard the robots (odometry, inertial 
sensors, 2d and 3d rangefinders, 3d vision, dgps, communications). the 
integrated information will be used for the construction of navigability 
maps that provide geometrical, topological and semantic information, 
quality and restrictions on communications, and information about dgps 
coverage. monitoring aspects include both, objects and people, and 
environment variables (temperature, humidity, etc). centralized and 
distributed algorithms will be developed for coordinating and 
integrating different partial perceptions provided by each robot in the 
team.

/- planning, navigation and multi-robot control./task planning and 
allocation take into account restrictions contained in various types of 
navigation maps and carried out according to various criteria (time, 
total distance, latency or average cost per task), keeping in any case 
the safety, the communications connectivity and a robust representation 
of the environment. to execute the plans, navigation techniques will be 
developed coordinating robots in dynamic environments in which people or 
other vehicles can share the scenario. the navigation techniques will 
allow the robot compliance with the changing environment, in which 
people or other vehicles can share the scenario with robots, monitored 
by the perception systems.

/- communications/. this module will address the development of 
propagation models of the interest signals (communications and dgps) for 
the construction of navigability maps. this modeling is also considered 
essential for bandwidth restriction imposed by an ad-hoc multi-hop 
wireless real-time network, which is composed of several robots and 
sensor nodes or bridges. in this sense we will investigate new protocols 
for increasing the bandwidth (e.g. tdma, spatial reuse) and new 
algorithms that optimize the information flow.

for the evaluation of the techniques, two types of application scenarios 
have been selected, each of which presents different problems to be 
solved: (1) logistics and transportation in indoor and outdoor scenarios 
(industrial parks, mines), in which the problems to solve focus on 
building robust models of the environment, task planning and allocation 
for the team of robots and coordinated navigation with communications; 
(2) the maintenance and monitoring of road tunnels, in which the 
deployment of robots, communication nodes and sensors must be specially 
considered taking into account the restrictions on communications 
connectivity.

description: realizing proficient human robot collaboration is a fundamental
challenge for robotics and in recent years it is becoming more and more
central, as robots use becomes more pervasive in society. in particular, an
important question is how to translate humans’ social skills into
human-robot interaction. we suggest that the efficient human mutual
understanding relies substantially on the implicit, non-verbal communication
associated to human motion (1, 2, 3). our approach aims at understanding
which robotic features promote natural and fluid human-robot interaction,
using robots both as tools to investigate human brain functions and as test
bed for the derived models. currently we are testing the motor and
perceptual principles usually adopted in human collaboration - as goal
anticipation (4, 5), automatic imitation (5), context-dependent perception
(6), weight understanding from action observation (7,8) - during human-robot
interaction experiments with the icub platform. the topic we propose as phd
activity is to further investigate how to establish efficient human - robot
collaboration by exploiting the natural mechanisms in place for human
interaction. the research will be based on designing different human-robot
interactive scenarios and assessing the efficiency of the collaboration and
the acceptance by the user, by means of multiple techniques, as
eye-tracking, motion capture and force measurements. the successful
candidate will also have the opportunity to spend part of his/her phd at the
osaka university and the university of tokyo in the framework of the marie
curie irses project codefror, with the purpose of integrating his/her
knowledge with the different expertise available at these institutes. 

requirements: background in computer sciences, robotics, computational or
behavioral neurosciences is required, as also willingness to make
experiments with human participants and strong motivation to work and adapt
to a multidisciplinary environment.

===========================================================================

description: social skills play a fundamental role since the very early
development stages. infants present a marked inclination for social
interaction, ranging from the preference for biological motion and mutual
gaze to imitation of facial expressions and auditory, oral, and motor
matching. such social inclination is supported by the gradual evolution of
the production and understanding of social signals, such as gestures, gaze
direction and emotional displays. to gain a deeper understanding of this
crucial stage of human development our goal is to design models of the
perceptual primitives supporting the acquisition of social skills in infants
and to test them on a humanoid robot. computer vision and machine learning
state-of-the-art methods will be the building blocks of the research to be
carried out. 

requirements: degree in robotics, bioengineering, computer science, computer
engineering, or related disciplines, attitude for problem solving. a
background on computer vision is an asset.

1894,2013,phd position opening at istituto italiano di tecnologia (iit),"can you please post the phd position opening advertisement below to the
robotics worldwide listserve?

thanks,

~netta gurari


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phd position opening on:

*“haptic device design, development, and application to *

*rehabilitative training based on multimodal action observation”*

*
*

* *

there is currently an opening for a phd position in the robotics, brain,
and cognitive sciences department (rbcs) at the istituto italiano di
tecnologia (italian institute of technology, iit) to work on the
development of a novel tactile feedback device for enhancing stroke
rehabilitation.  the phd candidate will work directly with an international
and interdisciplinary team of researchers: dr alberto ansaldo, dr. michela
bassolino, dr. netta gurari, and grzegorz bubak.  iit is located in genoa,
italy with state-of-the-art laboratories and international collaborations
in the field of robotics, neuroscience, cognitive systems, and
nanotechnologies. the three years position is fully funded, with a start
date of january 2014, and international applications are encouraged.


the goal of this research path is to enhance the effectiveness of available
rehabilitative training methods for stroke patients with motor deficits by
using an intervention based on multimodal action observation. action
observation is defined as the process of observing an action being
performed by others. in the last few years, a growing body of evidence
supports the notion that patients with motor disorders may have an improved
rehabilitative experience if they use action observation in addition to the
currently available traditional physical therapy (e.g., ertelt et al.,
2007, *neuroimage*; small et al., 2010, *developmental psychobiology*;
franceschini et al., 2013, *neurorehabil neural repair*).

the phd candidate will investigate whether the addition of veridical
tactile stimulation to action observation can enhance the brain plasticity
over solely observing an action. the phd candidate will create prototype(s)
of tactile feedback device(s) for relaying artificial cutaneous information
to a human (e.g., skin stretch, vibration) using both readily available and
novel actuator technologies. the candidate will test the effectiveness of
these devices by using both behavioral and neurophysiological methods, such
as psychophysics testing and transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms). the
aim is to have a device finalized and ready for use in rehabilitative
treatment of stroke patients at the completion of the doctoral work.

this work will be conducted alongside an interdisciplinary team of
researchers, currently representing three unique research fields
(neuroscience, mechanical engineering/haptics, materials science) and three
different countries (italy, usa, poland). the applicant should be excited
to work in such a collaborative environment, and be possibly interested in
spending a portion of his/her time conducting research in the usa and/or
switzerland. ideally, we are looking for candidates who have a background
in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science,
electrical engineering, experimental psychology, or closely related fields.
participants should be motivated to develop a novel tactile feedback device
(with support from the *robotics, brain and cognitive sciences *department
staff), to program visual and haptic virtual environments, and to perform
human subject testing with the device. we are looking for applicants who
have a proficiency in both written and spoken english and who are excited
to pursue a career in conducting scientific research.

tutors: dr. zhibin li, dr. roy featherstone, dr. nikos tsagarakis
department: advr (istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the capability of walking endows humans to traverse most landforms. however, to negotiate with discrete terrains, counteract large disturbance, and travel fast, the ability to jump, hop, and run becomes a must.

the research will explore the theoretical aspects of physics for jumping, hopping and running in order to discover the necessary physical attributes of a leg that is suitable at these tasks. the control aspects of jumping, hopping and running will also be explored in order to develop control schemes that obtain the highest possible performance from a given leg.
the candidate is expected to perform experiments on the leg prototype in order to investigate the practical and technical aspects of achieving high performance. the aim should be to demonstrate a level of performance that exceeds any existing leg designs demonstrated in literature. the leg compliance will also be studied for improving the stability and robustness given a set of physical parameters of the leg such as mass distribution, inertia.

requirements: the candidate should work as part of a team with the responsibility for analyzing the leg's performance at jumping, hopping and running, and suggesting approaches in which the leg design could be improved candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in rigid body dynamics, mechanics, classical and modern control theory, programming skills (matlab, c/c++) (dynamics/control %70, programming 30%).

theme: whole-body cooperative manipulation during dynamic locomotion
tutors: dr. zhibin li, dr. jinoh lee, dr. nikos tsagarakis
department: advr (istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the research aim is to develop a control framework that permits the humanoid robots to form multiple compliant contacts to perform cooperative manipulation tasks with humans while resolving the balancing, walking, and redundancy issues.

the algorithms to be developed should interpret certain level of motion intention from human operator through the contacts with the shared object so as to allow the robot to cooperate with human with no requirement of additional vision assistance. the phd candidate is expected to explore different control approaches such as optimal control, impedance control to robustly execute the manipulation tasks while undergoing external disturbances, limited sensor resolutions, non-modeled contact conditions (uncertainty from friction, elastic objects), and deal with the redundancy problem in real-time. apart from the control aspect, traditional sensory feedbacks such as joint torque, end-effector force/torque, as well as the novel sensory techniques such as robotic skins, will be investigated as well. the whole control framework might partition the manipulation task and the balancing or walking task as different modules, but since they are dynamically coupled, it has to consider the interplay between these sub-tasks in order to generate a smooth and dynamically stable whole-body motion. the algorithms will be tested on the full-body intrinsically compliant humanoid robot coman with torque control features (http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html).

requirements: candidates are expected to have good knowledge and experience in rigid body dynamics, classical and modern control theory and good programming skills (matlab, c/c++) (dynamics/control %70, programming 30%).

theme 8. developmental robotics and robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus around developmental robotics and robot learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot motor skills.

developmental robotics offers a qualitatively different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current humanoid robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts.

this phd theme aims to bring forward advances in the quality of robot motor skills towards biological richness. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use oversimplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff
robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. and developmental robotics offers one promising alternative for achieving this.

the phd theme will explore developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn novel skills. at the same time, robots should be capable of natural and robust interaction with people. the focus of the research will be on intelligent exploration techniques, robot learning and human-robot interaction.

theme 9. robot learning for agile locomotion of compliant humanoid robots
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. nikos tsagarakis

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offers a significant potential for achieving more agile locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders

the challenge

this phd position is funded by the european fp7 project “development of
robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders”
(acronym: dream). this exciting interdisciplinary, large-scale project,
involving 7 european partners  from  sweden , belgium, romania, united
kingdom, the netherlands, and france, will develop next-generation robots
that mediate between therapists and children with autism spectrum disorder
(asd) in autism therapy. in this robot-enhanced therapy (ret), the robots
will be able to interact with the child autonomously for limited periods
under the supervision of a therapist (“supervised autonomy”).

the use of robots in therapeutic contexts raises several ethical issues,
such as the degree of autonomy to be given to the robot and the question if
parents are happy to leave their child ‘in the hands of the robot’. the
“ethics” work package (wp) will address these ethical issues by making sure
that all relevant known ethical constraints and existing laws applicable
are implemented in the design process, by examining specific ethical
questions raised by the interaction between child and autonomous
therapeutic robots, and by investigating if and how we can build in ethical
constraints into the meta-cognition level of the robot. in addition,
through close collaboration between the technical and ethical researchers
and the asd practitioners, the project will determine how to achieve the
maximum impact of ret through effective integration of technology with
clinical therapy practices in general.

research leader of the “ethics” work package is dr. mark coeckelbergh, who
will act as the daily supervisor of the ph.d. project. the research leader
and the ph.d. candidate will collaborate very closely with partners from
all over europe who have different backgrounds, such as engineering and
psychology.

exclusively in ethics) and the proven ability and willingness to engage in
interdisciplinary research. consideration will also be given to outstanding
candidates with a social sciences or multidisciplinary master’s degree on a
topic relevant to the project, provided the candidate has some background
and experience in ethics.  demonstrable interest in philosophical issues
relating to  human-robot interaction.  highly motivated to become part of

both are in the area of robot learning, as described below.

theme 8. developmental robotics and robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus around developmental robotics and robot learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot motor skills.

developmental robotics offers a qualitatively different approach for controlling humanoid robots than the currently predominant approach based on manually engineered controllers. as a result, despite the significant mechatronic advances in humanoid robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current humanoid robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts.

this phd theme aims to bring forward advances in the quality of robot motor skills towards biological richness. the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use oversimplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff
robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control. and developmental robotics offers one promising alternative for achieving this.

the phd theme will explore developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn novel skills. at the same time, robots should be capable of natural and robust interaction with people. the focus of the research will be on intelligent exploration techniques, robot learning and human-robot interaction.

theme 9. robot learning for agile locomotion of compliant humanoid robots
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. nikos tsagarakis

department: advr (department of advanced robotics, istituto italiano di tecnologia)
http://www.iit.it/advr

description: the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offers a significant potential for achieving more agile locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

1964,2013,ph.d. position: humanoid walking on deformable terrains,"ph.d. position

topic: humanoid walking on deformable terrains


humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and poly-articulated
robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat surfaces,
slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated walking
gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic locomotion are
still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily flat) supports in
the environment. humans and animals however are capable to walk on
deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on highly
deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains: the first
ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or mud), the
second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least) part of it
when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).

in the frame of the forthcoming koroibot fp7 eu project (starting in october
2013), the topic of the thesis is to make current humanoids capable to walk
on such deformable terrains, by developing adequate models and controllers.
one particularity of the koroibot project is to measure human strategies
that may possibly inspire the strategy of the controllers. this study will
be performed at one of the koroibot team and the interested candidate will
be involved in the recording and the interpretation of motion capture data
of human walking on different deformable terrains. these data can be
exploited to design the control strategy for humanoid walking. once
implemented and experimented (under similar human measurement conditions),
we will compare the results and assess the robustness and the quality of the
humanoid robot walks.

these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging
scenarios involving the hrp-2 and hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the thesis will be conducted at the cnrs-aist joint robotics
laboratory, umi 3218/crt at tsukuba, japan and also partly at the cnrs-um2
lirmm at montpellier, france. 3 months shall be spent at one of the
partners’ laboratory to conduct human-motion capture data.

interested candidates shall send a detailed cv with a short motivation

1967,2013,phd position in development of a reconfigurable multi-finger robot for packaging applications,"19. development of a reconfigurable multi-finger robot for packaging applications

tutor: dr. ferdinando cannella, prof. lando mentrasti

nowadays the packaging is one of the technologies applied worldwide because all the goods exchanged (sold or bought) are packed. half of the study in this field is on the speed manufacturing that reached very good results for simple boxes; the complex carton, in the inverse, are far from reliable solutions and large part of this production is still by hands. despite this huge effort, till now few manipulators are built suitable for factories (as d-raps or archaps) and that demonstrates the difficult of this challenge.  in fact, the reconfigurability of the cartons not only requires dexterous manipulators, but for making competitive the devices, it is necessary even a deep knowledge of the cartonboard. goal of this phd is to design and build a new reconfigurable device able to fold origami carton autonomously depending on the initial final shape. this mechanism will be useful to study the cartonboard behavior during the folding and the new design of them. that means a virtual prototype of this device will be done in order to simulate the manipulation, so the best solution will be found quicker, because few physical prototyping will be necessary. thus the study will be divided in two parts: carton board mechanical properties investigation and carton folding manipulator design. the first one involves the experimental tests on carton and paper in order to determine the crease and panel stiffness:
*     micro-model of cartonboard (fibers networks simulation): micro-scale crease stiffness
*     meso-model of cartonboard (multilayer): meso-scale crease stiffness (finite element): creasing process design
*     1:1-model of cartonboard (one layer):  1:1 scale crease stiffness (finite element + multibody simulation): damage
*     macro-model of the cartonboard (on line): macro-scale crease stiffness (multibody simulation+analitycal model of the crease stiffness)
second one concerns the theory of the manipulation and hierarchy of the panel rotation. together they will permit to simulate the physic model of origami carton folding. considering the small forces and torques used in these folding, the feedback in the control will be very complex because the measurement signal are always very weak compared to the noise given by the cartonboard dynamics (e.g. the backlashes or panel bending). the paten should be another goal of this study.
this work will be developed in strong collaboration with king's college of london, uk under supervision of prof. jian s. dai
requirements: this position is open to a phd candidate with strong interesting in reconfigurable mechanism and skill in mechanics. the background must be in mechanical/mechatronic engineer or robotics. the ideal competencies should be in multibody simulation/finite element analysis and robot dynamics and control.
required technical skills: 50% mechanics, 25% control, 25% kinematics

1976,2013,"2 phd positions available at the university of birmingham, uk","two phd positions are available in the intelligent robotics laboratory 
(irlab) at the university of birmingham


position 1: learning models of human behaviour

this project is part of an fp7 project called strands 
(http://www.strands-project.eu/), involving 30+ people, of whom a team 
of 6 work at the birmingham irlab 
(http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/robotics/). in the overall 
project we investigate the task a robot that must perform 4d mapping. by 
this we mean producing not just a map of space (3d mapping), but also of 
the activities that occur within that space.  such activity maps are 
necessary for robots to act within a space shared with humans.

the activities performed in an environment by many humans over a period 
of time can typically be viewed as being composed of many smaller 
complex events and interactions. many of these events occur 
periodically. there are differences across repetitions. the challenge of 
this phd is how to recognise and exploit this periodicity in order to 
build compact models of complex behaviour involving multiple humans over 
long timescales (hours and days). the work will consider how the 
ordering and frequency of sub-events can be learned, taking account of 
the fact that sometimes particular sub-events may not occur, or that 
their ordering may be changed.

position 2: gaze control during robot manipulation of objects

the pacman project (www.pacman-project.eu) is concerned with modelling 
objects as hierarchies of parts in 2d and 3d, and using these models to 
guide manipulation. one important question is given such models how to 
gather information during grasping.

in this phd we will look at how to gather information about objects 
using vision. we will build on a model of visual gaze control previously 
developed by ourselves. the approach poses the problem of where the 
robot should look next as one of choosing gaze to maximise the increase 
in reliability of robot grasping. speci cally the robot maintains a 
scene model with a belief  filter for each item of interest (e.g. an 
object) and models the expected e ffect on belief of diff erent 
candidate gazes. the winning gaze is the one that will lead to the 
largest expected gain in manipulation performance on a task which is 
itself modelled as a rewarding process. in this phd we will do two main 
pieces of work. first we will extend our gaze control model to consider 
gazing at parts of
objects suggested by the hierarchical model of object shape that are 
relevant for grasping. second we will implement and evaluate the 
resulting gaze control model on a real robot. our current model only 
deals with uncertainty in pose. in this task we will extend that to 
cover object shape, including missing surfaces.

environment:

the irlab at birmingham is a leading european lab working in many 
aspects of intelligent robotics. the group has six faculty, seven 
research fellows and fifteen research students. the lab has a state of 
the art equipment with access to a wide range of advanced platforms for 
mobility and manipulation.

you should have a batchelors or masters in computer science, electronic 
engineering, mathematics or physics. you should have excellent 
mathematical and coding skills. you will have graduated in the top 5% of 
your class.

in the first instance contact jeremy wyatt  (jlw at cs.bham.ac.uk), with 
your cv and transcript. put ""strands phd application"" or ""pacman phd 
application"" as appropriate in the subject line. deadline for 
applications is the 30th october, late applications will be considered 
if the appointment process hasn't gone too far.

title: *human robot physical interactions with an exoskeleton for
rehabilitation: sharing of control in joint articular dimension and
sensorimotor reinforcement.


*phd topics :*
the project is to develop, setup and evaluate some innovative control modes
dedicated to the neuro-rehabilitation of upper limbs in hemiparetic
patients. it is based on the exoskeleton platform able (cea-list) and on an
innovative control principle in joint space developed in the laboratory
during the project anr-psirob brahma.
the main objective is to develop a set of controllers allowing the
exoskeleton to apply different types of constraints on the human arm,
independently in the joint space or in the end-effectors’ space. a new
control mode aiming to impose a different coordination schema (synergy) has
already been developed. this exploited both the redundancy of the
exoskeleton with 4 dof in a simple pointing task (3 dof) and the use of
viscous fields in the perspective to correct abnormal synergies in the
patients. the aim is now to improve this innovative mode, which is the only
one taking advantage of the structure of the exoskeleton by reference to
the modes developed for the structures with a single contact point with the
human.

*the main objectives of the thesis are :*
- to investigate the possibility to use force fields in the joint space of
the human arm.
- to develop a set of tools for the analysis and the quantification of the
movements produced by a human wearing/using an exoskeleton.
- to evaluate the sensorimotor consequences of the human-robot interaction
with an exoskeleton during elementary gestures in a virtual environment

more generally, the principal objective of this thesis is to develop two
kinds of robots' control modes either assistive (i.e. guiding arm
coordination) or disturbing (inducing sensations and encouraging active
corrections) along with with associated methodology for evaluation. these
modes will be experimented in healthy subjects and their proof of concept
will be tested in patients thanks to clinical collaborations. finally, the
aim will be to prepare a clinical evaluation and comparison of these
control modes in a clinical setting.

*required qualifications :*
- b.s. or m.s. in mechanical/electrical/computer engineering;
- knowledge in programming (c, c++), real-time control architectures for
robots and data analysis (matlab);
- highly self-motivated and persistent with strong critical and analytical
thinking skills.
- ability and desire to conduct experiments with humans and for the
analysis of experimental data.

*preferred qualifications :*
- knowledge in virtual reality, man-machine interfaces and haptics ;
- past experience in rehabilitation or assistive robotics.

an early start in december 2013 is desired, therefore the application
deadline is the 5th of november 2013.

*application instructions:*
phd application should be sent by email to jarrasse at isir.upmc.fr and should
include the following attachments:
- statement of motivation and relevant experience
- cv (curriculum vitae) / resume
- copies of university certificates
- list of attended classes and grades

====================================================


topic: embodied cognitive modeling of language processing and dialogue 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

we are seeking highly qualified candidates who want to participate as a phd student researcher in a larger scale project at bielefeld university's center of excellence on cognitive interaction technology (citec) [1,2]. the project aims to investigate how a robot can familiarize itself with novel objects and actions through exploratory manual interaction in its environment under guidance of a human tutor. the goal is to develop deep representations of objects and actions, using language to engage in dialogue with the tutor to guide the ongoing interaction and familiarization process. language processing and dialogue shall thereby be grounded in embodied cognitive processes.

in particular, we are searching for a phd student working on the language aspects of this project. the task is to build a cognitively motivated representation system which interconnects different levels of abstraction and is grounded in the (already present) lower-level sensorimotor capabilities of the robot. the researcher will have to develop an intermediate type of conceptual representation which should be based on or is connected to schema theories and should in particular focus on dynamic representation of action. the targeted outcome is an implemented formalism for action semantics that links up lower-levels of sensorimotor processing with linguistic processing of syntax and semantics, as e.g. provided by construction grammar based approaches. a second goal is to build dialogue strategies on top of this formalism, e.g. to enable clarification questions geared to reduce uncertainty in this mental simulation.

the successful candidate has a background in cognitive science/a.i. and linguistics, and is in particular familiar with, or motivated to learn about a deep understanding of cognition within holistic approaches to complex embodied cognitive systems. knowledge on cognitive linguistic formalism and schema theory will be helpful.

job description

university of washington, department of electrical engineering
biorobotics laboratory
project title: computer modeled multiportal approaches to the skull base

the fellow will work closely with surgeons and engineers to refine and
validate a computer model and develop software to aid in surgical planning.
 the successful candidate, will develop and validate a novel surgical
planning software application for minimally invasive approaches to the
skull base. candidate will build from existing proof-of-concept
implementation in matlab and 3d slicer.  both commercialization and
academic goals will be pursued.

qualifications:

completed doctoral degree in electrical engineering, computer science,
biomedical engineering, or equivalent. computer coding skills in c++,
matlab, python, and opengl.   cloud computing experience in platforms such
as amazon aws is desired.
interpersonal communication and leadership skills to organize lab sessions
with multiple surgeons to test model.  evidence of ability to publish
results of research projects.

project
surgery for skull base tumors is relatively common; there are 30,000 new
skull base tumors each year in the united states alone. many of these are
resected through an open craniotomy. unfortunately, this type of highly
invasive surgical access to skull base lesions often creates significant
morbidity. newer endoscopic approaches reduce this morbidity, decrease
operative time, decrease recovery time postoperatively, and possibly
obviate the need for an open craniotomy to access certain skull base
targets. yet, current endoscopic approaches are limited by narrow portals
to the skull base (e.g., nasal aperture). combining multiportal approaches
offers promise to improve surgical access while continuing to minimize
adverse effects, but testing these complex approaches is challenging. the
goal of this project is to develop and validate a 3d computer model and
algorithm that helps identify and test the optimal approaches for
endoscopic access and excision of skull base lesions in patients.

there are three specific aims:

1) develop a 3d computer model of the skull to measure approach angles and
access to specified target locations.
2) determine the optimal combination of surgical approaches to improve
surgical manipulation and visualization at clinically significant target
locations, including portals that permit robotic surgery integration.
3) validate the computer model in cadaver specimens and test robotic
feasibility on the skull base.

evaluation of the model will test the hypothesis that multiportal
approaches significantly broaden the angle of access to the target and
minimize the probability of instrument collisions on 11 specific target
locations for 20 established surgical approaches.  it is anticipated that
the model will demonstrate the shortest, most direct, and least traumatic
pathways to skull base targets. we will derive optimized approach
solution(s) for each of the targets defined around the pituitary gland and
will generate normative data on the approach combinations based on 12
cadaver ct scans. the technique and software will permit individualized
preoperative rehearsal and approach planning. these steps will serve as a
platform for integrating robotic tools into skull base surgery, which will
be tested on cadaver specimens using the da vinci and raven robotic
systems.    in addition to immediate project responsibilities, the
candidate will be expected to develop student research supervision skills
and there will be
opportunities to interact with related projects and develop new and
existing ideas.

2009,2013,postdoc opening at lirmm montpellier: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts,"laboratory: lirmm (cnrs/university montpellier 2), montpellier, france
department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts   

in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program a haptic observer returning the localization and magnitude of external contacts on the humanoid’s body. this will be done through fusion of the information from sensors embedded on the robot (including tactile sensing when available). such a haptic observer will first be developed based on classical available sensors, that are: force sensors at the ankles and hands’ wrists, accelerometers, gyro, inclinometers, desired postures (desired joints), imu and motor torques’ estimation. eventually, an extended haptic observer will also be developed to integrate tactile and force sensing if available, on parts of the humanoid robots. one of the distinguishing issues we would like to deal with is the integration of rgbd vision as part of the haptic observer. change in vision viewpoint, flow, may provide a lot of information on contact. needless to say that in some configurations, vision can also assess the localization of a non-desired or desired contact. the resulting robust whole-body haptic sensing observer will ideally return: the number of contacts, their localization on each link, the external wrench per link, distributed pressure per contact and force estimation (include tangential one) per link. the proposed observer must meet robustness and real-time performances to be used in closed-loop control for tasks such as: multi-contact stabilization, visio-haptic motion control and multi-contact planning.

candidates with background in estimation/identification, observers design in control theory, signal processing are preferred. further details can be obtained during the interview.

these researches and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assistance scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organized in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program active compliance behaviors of a humanoid robot in haptic interaction with the environment or a human. tasks carried out in contact with the environment or humans call de-facto for safety issues. not only should the human partner not be harmed in any situation, but the robot must also ensure its own safety (since the human can be a strong source of perturbation to the robot). this challenging problem is of prime importance. while studies in particular at dlr in germany have considered this issue in previous (phriends, viactors) and current (saphari) european projects, none of them has considered the problem of safety in human-humanoid interaction that is linked to the potential of falling with a human. of course fundamentals in terms of admissible impedance, impulse forces, compliant hardware reported in robotic safety will be considered. but additional ones, namely humanoid falling when being in close physical contact with a human, calls for a different approach in terms of reflex strategies and the control that is to be implemented in addition to non-harming contacts in direct interaction. we will investigate a set of strategies to guarantee safety of the haptic interaction in most critical circumstances. aldebaran partner will provide knowledge related to norms and standards to be considered and will use the results of this project to improve the understanding of this very new kind of man-machine interaction. a lot has been told about safety in robotics but real experiments with humanoids are still missing, and this research will bring new valid data into the discussion. in order to do so, we will identify situations where the motion is not viable (i.e. the interaction is not controllable) and having human-in-the-loop adds difficulty to this process. assuming this, we will propose taxonomy of these critical situations and devise for each a set of rules/guidelines/policies to avoid it and another set of rules/guidelines/policies to deal with it in conjunction with the available norms and standards.
 
these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assist scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organized in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

************************************************

two position for phd fellowships are open for the bambi project 
(bottom-up approaches to machines dedicated to bayesian inference), 
funded by the european commission under the fet project - fp7-ict-2013-c 
- see the abstract of the project below. the fellowships include, 
besides regular stipend, work insurance and social security payments, 
phd tuition fees and a yearly fund for other research expenses. for more 
information on the project and the position, please read the text 
transcribed below and/or send an e-mail to: jorge lobo 
(jlobo at isr.uc.pt),  jorge dias (jorge at isr.uc.pt) or joão filipe ferreira 
(jfilipe at isr.uc.pt).


phd scientific area:

electronic engineering and computer sciences - robotics and automation

prerequisites:

a msc degree (5 years of university studies) in 
electrical/electronic/biomedical engineering or computer science. 
preference is given to candidates with academic background with a msc 
thesis experience in digital computer hardware or programmable digital 
devices or distributed computing.

work plan:

the candidates will ensue phd studies on computational theory  with 
experiments of probabilistic computation. the research will study 
probabilistic computation following two major axes: algebra and 
reconfigurable hardware. the activities will be in coordination with the 
project team at university of coimbra ensuring the successful 
implementation of the aims of the bambi project (bottom-up approaches to 
machines dedicated to bayesian inference).

location:

the studies and academic training will be executed at the university of 
coimbra with support of the mobile robotics laboratory 
(http://mrl.isr.uc.pt) from the institute of systems and robotics 
(http://www.isr.uc.pt). the activities will be under the scientific 
advising of dr jorge dias and dr jorge lobo, with support of dr. joão 
filipe ferreira. the research activities may include short academic 
visit periods at other partners  within the bambi project consortium in 
france and belgium.

temporal span:

the fellowship corresponds contract expectedly starting in january 2013, 
and conditionally renewable for an additional three year period 
depending on the candidate's performance. the contract include an 
initial probation period of *six (6) months before it becomes 
effective*.

summary of the project:

we propose a theory and a hardware implementation of probabilistic 
computation inspired by biochemical cell signaling. we will study 
probabilistic computation following three axes: algebra, biology, and 
hardware. in each case, we will develop a bottom-up hierarchical 
approach starting from the elementary components, and study how to 
combine them to build more complex systems. we propose bayesian gates 
operating on probability distributions on binary variables as the 
building blocks of our probabilistic algebra. these bayesian gates can 
be seen as a generalization of logical operators in boolean algebra. we 
propose to interpret elementary cell signaling pathways as biological 
implementation of these probabilistic gates. in turn, the key features 
of biochemical processes give new insights for innovative probabilistic 
hardware implementation. we propose to associate conventional 
electronics and novel stochastic nano-devices to build the required 
hardware elements. combining them will lead to new artificial 
information processing systems, which could, in the future, outperform 
classical computers in tasks involving a direct interaction with the 
physical world. for these purposes, the bambi project associates 
research in bayesian probability theory, molecular biology, nanophysics, 
computer science and electronics.

2101,2013,post-doctoral position at cnrs/aist jrl,"*topic*: *humanoid walking on deformable terrains *





humanoid walk planning and control are studied both in robotics and in
computer graphics animation. currently, virtual avatars and
poly-articulated robots such as humanoid robots can move on horizontal flat
surfaces, slightly sloped ground or climb stairs. the recently demonstrated
walking gait generation and footprints planning in humanoid robotic
locomotion are still primarily dealing with rigid (but not necessarily
flat) supports in the environment. humans and animals however are capable
to walk on deformable terrains such as sand, mattress, etc. and even on
highly deformable ones. we distinguish two types of deformable terrains:
the first ones do not restitute any energy after deformation (e.g. sand or
mud), the second ones store energy when deforming and restitute (at least)
part of it when no load are applied on them (e.g. mattress or trampoline).



in the frame of the koroibot fp7 eu project, the topic of this post-doc is
to make current humanoids capable to walk on such deformable terrains, by
developing adequate models and controllers. one particularity of the
koroibot project is to measure human strategies that may possibly inspire
the strategy of the controllers. this study will be performed at one of the
koroibot team and the interested candidate will be involved in the
recording and the interpretation of motion capture data of human walking on
different deformable terrains. these data can be exploited to design the
control strategy for humanoid walking. once implemented and experimented
(under similar human measurement conditions), we will compare the results
and assess the robustness and the quality of the humanoid robot walks.



these research and developments must be demonstrated in challenging
scenarios involving the hrp-2 and hrp-4 humanoid robots.


 *locations*: the post-doc will be conducted at the cnrs-aist joint
robotics laboratory, umi 3218/crt at tsukuba, japan and also partly at the
cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. 3 months shall be spent at one of
the partners’ laboratory to conduct human-motion capture data.


*duration*: 2 years, possible extension to 3 years.



we are looking for a candidate with a good background in humanoid walking,
automatics or mathematics. a fair knowledge in c++ and python would be a
plus for the experimental part.

interested candidates shall send a detailed cv with a cover letter
highlighting their work related to the subject to the following advisory
