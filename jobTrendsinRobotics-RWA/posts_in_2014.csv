*graduate assistantships*

*department of computer science & engineering*

*university of nevada, reno, usa*

the department of *computer science and engineering (cse)* at the *university
of nevada, reno (unr) *(http://www.cse.unr.edu) invites applications for
graduate assistantships. successful applicants will receive *financial
support* through teaching assistantships (tas) or research assistantships
(ras). ras will conduct innovative research in cooperation with and under
the supervision of departmental faculty. activities of ras include
implementing prototype systems, developing and proving new theory,
conducting experiments, attending international conferences, and publishing
their results in scholarly journals and conferences. tas work under the
supervision of departmental faculty in support of the teaching mission of
the university. activities of tas include teaching recitation sections or
laboratories, assisting in grading, and assisting in the development of
course materials and exams. typical support for graduate assistantships
covers the student's *tuition and fees, health insurance,* and offers a
minimum financial stipend of *$1,550 / month*.

both m.s. and ph.d. students are eligible for the graduate assistantships.
however, *strong preference will be given to those applying or pursuing a
ph.d. degree*. the department currently has 35 phd students in the program
and expects to increase the size to 50 over the next few years. many of the
department's full-time phd students are currently fully supported, and the
department expects to have sufficient funding to support additional
students in the upcoming years. students who wish to enter the graduate
program must possess a bachelors degree in computer science, computer
engineering or a related field. the department will consider applications
from students lacking this background if they show exceptional promise.
specifics of admission process and program requirements can be found at:
http://www.unr.edu/cse/academics/degrees.

the cse department has 15 full time faculty members and offers b.s., m.s.,
and ph.d. degrees supporting a dynamic and growing program with more than
500 undergraduate and 80 graduate students. graduate students in cse are
given the opportunity to focus on a specific area by taking advanced

networks, and wireless communications. our research activities and
experimental facilities have been well supported by major funding agencies,
including nsf, dod, dhs and nasa as well as by companies such as google,
microsoft and at&t.

universities across the country have found it necessary to raise tuition
and fees in recent years, and unr is no exception. however, unr's tuition
and fees continue to rank near the median of western u.s. public
universities. in 2010-11, of the 16 western public universities, unr ranked
#6 for resident graduate tuition (#1 is the lowest) and #10 for
non-resident graduate tuition (source: wiche). unr is an integral part of
the reno metro area, home to about 350,000 people. the 255-acre main
campus, located minutes from downtown reno, features both contemporary and
historic architecture, and the university’s tree-lined quadrangle is listed
on the national register of historic places. the academic atmosphere is
filled with rich surroundings for the cultural and intellectual development
of the students. reno benefits from a comfortable climate; and is bounded
on the west by the majestic sierra nevada mountain range and on the east by
the rolling basin and range province. there are four distinct seasons in
this cool, dry climate where the sun shines nearly 290 days a year. the
area is noted for its variety of recreational opportunities, which include
sailing, camping, hiking, fishing, and sightseeing. within an hour’s drive
of the campus, for example, are lake tahoe in the high sierra; and pyramid
lake, a unique prehistoric desert sea; and a number of nationally known ski
areas, including squaw valley, the site of the 1960 winter olympics. reno
is within 2 hours' drive from sacramento and 3.5 hours' drive from san
francisco.

for consideration, interested applicants must submit the graduate
assistantship and fellowship application
form<http://www.unr.edu/documents/engineering/college/gafa.doc>
 *in addition* to the admission application, which is due on *january

2125,2014,"ph.d. position in femto-st institute, france","open ph.d. position at femto-st institute/franche-comte university in 
dexterous robotic micro-nano-manipulation.

context
the development of micro-grippers which can simultaneously perform 
translation and rotation positioning of the manipulated object is 
strategically important for micro-nanomanipulation and especially for 
micro-assembly. however, because of the physical and technological 
constraints at this scale (grippers composed of simple translating 
fingers), it is particularly difficult to control the angular position 
of the manipulated object. the current industrial solution is to use 
rotation stages to rotate the whole robotic system. however, this 
solution affects the accuracy and the speed of the system because using 
bulky devices and mechanisms increases ambience-induced errors and 
limits the rotation range of the handling object. to improve the 
micro-manipulation performance, the approach consists of achieving local 
manipulation including both translation and rotation of the manipulated 
object using the gripper's fingers, which is known as dexterous 
manipulation.

objectives
the objective of this phd thesis is to develop different 
micro-manipulation strategies. this opens several scientific problems 
related to modeling, trajectory planning, mechanical design and 
automatic control of micro-grippers. the choice of the orientation of 
the thesis will be discussed with the selected phd student during the 
thesis.

one of the major problem which has to be addressed is the definition of 
the dexterous micro-manipulation strategy and the associated path 
planning taking into account the technological and physical constraints 
at this scale. one of the particular properties at microscale is the 
existence of strong adhesion forces. the phd student will study the 
usability of these forces to increase the dexterity of the manipulator 
using the sticky fingers effect during the manipulation. indeed, this 
property can relax the constraints concerning the number of fingers 
required for stable grasping. it enables manipulation with with a fewer 
number of fingers and consequently increases the flexibility of the 
manipulator and enhances its dexterity. the generated solutions will 
have to be simulated to evaluate their performances. the selected 
solution will then be experimentally tested in partnership with our 
industrial partner “percepio robotics” who will be in charge of the 
prototype manufacturing.

qualifications
the candidate should have obtained an excellent master's degree in 
robotics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering or a related 
field. a strong background in one of these fields would be necessary: 
mechanical design, automatic control, dexterous manipulation, computer 
vision, artificial intelligence, path planning, multiphysics simulation. 
very good programming (c++, matlab) and computer (linux, windows) skills 
are required. the candidate should also be autonomous, methodological, 
highly motivated.

application

cover letter (all combined as a single pdf) to:
redwan.dahmouche at femto-st.fr

closing date: february 15, 2014

phd position on automatic analysis of affective and social behaviors in
human-robot interaction

http://www.utwente.nl/vacatures/en/

job specification
the human media interaction group at the university of
twente is looking for a phd candidate who will automatically analyse
social interactions based on the speakers' non-verbal behaviors in
speech (paralinguistic information). the aims are to automatically
determine the quality of social interaction between the speakers (both
in dialogues and multi-party conversations) and the speakers' affective
states using vocal cues. qualitative aspects of social interaction
include, amongst others, levels of engagement, cooperation,
enjoyableness, arousal, valence and rapport.

the work will be carried out within the contexts of two european
projects involving robots, namely teresa and squirrel. in the teresa
project, a telepresence robot is controlled by a human controller who
can have robot-mediated conversations with other humans in the vicinity
of the robot. in order to know whether a specific speaker attitude is
caused by the robot's or the human controller's behavior, an assessment
of the interaction is needed. the challenges are to give a continuous
assessment of the quality of interaction under natural conditions, and
to find out what non-verbal vocal cues can be used to detect qualitative
aspects of social interaction. in the squirrel project, children will be
interacting with a robot that aims to encourage and help them tidy up
and put objects back in order. in order to design effective robot
behaviors that encourage and help children tidy up, an assessment of the
interaction among the children and the robot is needed: is the
interaction fun, are the children engaged in the task, is one of the
children excluded in the interaction?

the work will cover a range of various tasks:

* the candidate will collect speech data by recording social
interactions between adult humans (french) and among children (german)
and robots. (s)he will develop and manage audio(visual) databases of
these recorded interactions.

* the candidate will perform analyses on the non-verbal vocal behavior
of the recorded interactions. the candidate will investigate what types
of qualitative and affective aspects of social interaction are relevant
in this context and annotations will be made.

* (s)he will identify relevant non-verbal vocal cues that correlate with
qualitative and affective aspects of social interaction.

* based on these annotations, the candidate will develop algorithms to
automatically assess qualitative and affective aspects of social
interaction, both in human adult and children speech.

* the candidate is expected to present his/her work in major
(international) conferences and workshops, and to publish in relevant
journals.


your profile

* the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
spoken language. since the candidate will be working with dutch, french
and german data, knowledge of these languages is preferable.

* the candidate has an msc degree in computer science or equivalent (a
degree with a technical background in, e.g., artificial intelligence,
computational linguistics).

* the candidate is interested in the research fields of speech analysis,
affective computing, social signal processing, and machine learning.

* the candidate has programming skills in one of the following languages
(or equivalents): python, perl, or matlab.

please send your application with your cv and motivation letter through
the application link before february 7, 2014. please also include the
names, email addresses, phone numbers, and information about past
working relationships of two people that we could contact for a
recommendation.

further information about the phd position can be given by dr. khiet
truong (k.p.truong at utwente.nl) and prof. dr. vanessa evers (email:
v.evers at utwente.nl).

scientific area:

  robotics and automation / cognitive robotics


prerequisites:

a phd degree (post-doctoral fellowship) in 
electronic/electrical/biomedical engineering, computer science or 
similar.


work plan:

the candidate will be responsible for driving research efforts on theory 
and hardware implementation of probabilistic computation. the research 
will study probabilistic computation following two major axes: algebra 
and reconfigurable hardware. the activities will be in coordination with 
the project team at university of coimbra ensuring the successful 
implementation of the project's overall plan and the fulfilment of the 
scientific and technical aspects of its milestones.

the fellowship corresponds to a 12-month contract, renewable and 
expectedly starting in january 2013. *a probation period will be 
considered for the first 6 months*.

summary of the project:

we propose a theory and a hardware implementation of probabilistic 
computation inspired by biochemical cell signaling. we will study 
probabilistic computation following three axes: algebra, biology, and 
hardware. in each case, we will develop a bottom-up hierarchical 
approach starting from the elementary components, and study how to 
combine them to build more complex systems. we propose bayesian gates 
operating on probability distributions on binary variables as the 
building blocks of our probabilistic algebra. these bayesian gates can 
be seen as a generalization of logical operators in boolean algebra. we 
propose to interpret elementary cell signaling pathways as biological 
implementation of these probabilistic gates. in turn, the key features 
of biochemical processes give new insights for innovative probabilistic 
hardware implementation. we propose to associate conventional 
electronics and novel stochastic nano-devices to build the required 
hardware elements. combining them will lead to new artificial 
information processing systems, which could, in the future, outperform 
classical computers in tasks involving a direct interaction with the 
physical world. for these purposes, the bambi project associates 
research in bayesian probability theory, molecular biology, nanophysics, 
computer science and electronics.

remote robotic manipulation requires a tremendous amount of integration of perception, cognition, and action within and between the agents (the human and the robot). this proposal aims at advancing our understanding of human motor control in remote manipulation tasks and utilizing this knowledge for developing improved telerobotic systems. we specifically target remote manipulation of soft objects, with haptic feedback. haptic feedback is of great importance for dexterous manipulation of soft, deformable objects. yet, due to inherent delays in the transmission of information between the local and remote sites, conveying realistic haptic feedback in remote manipulation systems is currently an unresolved research problem. in the course of the research we will implement and test different controllers for remote manipulation and test operator operation under both conditions. motion recognition based various methods will be tested as a basis for mapping operator motion to robot commands. 

phd applicants must have completed an msc degree in engineering, natural sciences, computer sciences or psychology with a thesis. experience in artificial intelligence, robotics, cognitive science and programming is an advantage. ph.d. candidates must submit a research proposal and pass a qualification exam on their research proposal within the first year of the phd studies. the phd thesis should be completed within a 4-year timeframe.

*oxford brookes university - phd studentship*





the department of computing and communications technologies at oxford

studentship to a new student commencing in june 2014. the successful
applicant will receive an annual bursary of £10,000 for three years (with
no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the universty.



the successful candidate will work within the artificial intelligence and
vision group of the department of computing and communication technologies,
under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin.



topic of research: *uncertainty in computer vision*



decision making and estimation are central in most applied sciences, as the
need often arises to make inferences about the state of the external world,
based on information which is at best limited, if not downright misleading.
uncertainty can be dealt with in a number of ways. generative probabilistic
graphical models, which describe how the data are generated via classical
distribution functions, are most used for complex, multi-person activity
recognition. discriminative models which do not attempt to model data
generation, but focus on learning how to discriminate between data
belonging to different categories or classes, are dominant in action and
gesture recognition, in which we aim at recognising human actions based on
a limited training set of examples, captured via conventional or range
cameras. imprecise-probabilistic models which assume the data is
probabilistic but insufficient to estimate a precise probability
distribution, have been successfully employed in example-based human pose
estimation. depending on the problem we need to tackle, we might need to
consider metric learning techniques for generative models, latent svm
part-based discriminative approaches, or a meaningful integration of the
two.



the successful candidate will work on both the theoretical development and
the application of these techniques to scenarios such as the interaction
with a humanoid robot able to recognise and mimic natural human gesturing,
the retrieval of videos from internet repositories such as youtube, the
monitoring of the health of people affected by brain conditions in their
own homes, via range sensors such as kinect.

2162,2014,phd position in robotic rehabilitation at nanyang technological university,"compliant advanced robotic actuation powering assistive composite exoskeleton 
assistant professor lorenzo masia 
n. of available positions: 1 
intake: august 2014 

exoskeletons represent nowadays the ultimate challenge in robotics,
especially for those applications where is required a level of additional
effort for assisting a subject lacking of voluntarily control due to
neurological damage or empowering human mobility or dexterity in working
environments. despite several devices have been developed and commercialized
the diffusion of such kind of technology still remain driven by the
conventional electromechanical actuation with the intrinsic limitations of
power consumption, safety and power-weight ratio. the project aims to
provide innovative solutions and overcome the aforementioned limitations by
introducing a new concept of actuation technology based on a novel
generation of adaptive/multifunctional structures working in
elastically-nonlinear regimes and providing an unconventional approach that
merges modern mechatronic technology and theory of composite materials. the
ambition is to challenge current design principles, deliver new ones and
create novel paradigms for control robustness by addressing the development
and use of safe, energy-efficient and highly dynamic non-linear actuation
systems based on multistable composite structures. this will permit the
embodiment of natural characteristics found in biological systems, into the
structures of a new generation of mechatronic assistive/augmenting devices
with the possibility to finely modulate and to predict the mechanical
impedance of composite material structures. the unconventional design of a
novel actuated mechanism using the tunable compliance of the carbon fiber
reinforced laminates will allow to downsize the electromechanical
counterpart and consequently the power requirements.       
the present research theme aims to coordinate a multidisciplinary approach
to the develop and use of compliant robotic technology and multistable
composite structures for a new concept of actuation for assistive augmenting
technology: the candidate will be required to design and characterize the
actuators and develop assistive technology based on the proposed concept to
assist/empower human motor performance. the project will be broken down into
the following steps: conceptual design and simulation of new hardware;
mechanical design and assembly of the system; characterization and control
of the device and experimental trials on humans. 
the research student scholarship will be provided by intelligent systems
center of nanyang technological university (singapore) and st engineering
today one of asia's largest defense and engineering groups (round the world
more than 22,000 employees).  
requirements: we are preferably seeking candidates with a background in
mechanical/aerospace engineering and/or robotics. 
the ideal candidate will be familiar with control engineering, robotics,
mechanical measurements and instrumentation, biomechanics, structural
engineering and/or theoretical understanding and practical knowledge of
advanced composite materials. 
he/she will have generic mechanical engineering skills such as manual skills
for hardware assembly, strong experience in cad mechanical design,
solidworks, pro-e, alibre, and with matlab/simulink.

2173,2014,postdoc opening at lirmm montpellier: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts,"laboratory: lirmm (cnrs/university montpellier 2), montpellier, france
department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts   

in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program a haptic observer returning the localization and magnitude of external contacts on the humanoid’s body. this will be done through fusion of the information from sensors embedded on the robot (including tactile sensing when available). such a haptic observer will first be developed based on classical available sensors, that are: force sensors at the ankles and hands’ wrists, accelerometers, gyro, inclinometers, desired postures (desired joints), imu and motor torques’ estimation. eventually, an extended haptic observer will also be developed to integrate tactile and force sensing if available, on parts of the humanoid robots. one of the distinguishing issues we would like to deal with is the integration of rgbd vision as part of the haptic observer. change in vision viewpoint, flow, may provide a lot of information on contact. needless to say that in some configurations, vision can also assess the localization of a non-desired or desired contact. the resulting robust whole-body haptic sensing observer will ideally return: the number of contacts, their localization on each link, the external wrench per link, distributed pressure per contact and force estimation (include tangential one) per link. the proposed observer must meet robustness and real-time performances to be used in closed-loop control for tasks such as: multi-contact stabilization, visio-haptic motion control and multi-contact planning.

candidates with background in estimation/identification, observers design in control theory, signal processing are preferred. further details can be obtained during the interview.

these researches and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assistance scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organized in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

2189,2014,"final call for a phd position at the max planck institute for biological cybernetics, tuebingen, germany","apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement.

*[important note]* please be advised that the deadline to apply for this
phd position is today *31st march 2014*.

*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,
multi-robot systems.

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.


*expected qualifications and skills of the candidate*

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical
   engineering, computer science or other related fields.
   - the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
   spoken language.
   - prior experience in computer vision and image processing is essential.
   - the candidate must have excellent programming skills in one or more
   languages, e.g., c, c++ and python.
   - knowledge and experience in robot operating system (ros) will be a
   plus.

*selection procedure*
interested candidates who meet the above mentioned requirements should send
the following documents (all in pdf format) to aahmad at isr.ist.utl.pt by
31st march, 2014

   - motivation letter.
   - curriculum vitae (including a list of publications)
   - online link to their own code snippets or softwares developed (these
   can be inserted as a section in the cv).
   - a 2-page summary of their master thesis or any other research results
   (which they consider as their most important results) (bibliography should
   not be within these 2-page limit)
   - copy of the last diploma and transcripts (grade sheet).

selected candidate will be expected to enroll in the phd program in the
beginning of september 2014 at the university of tübingen and will carry
out their research work at max planck institute for biological cybernetics,
tübingen. however, prior to the phd enrollment, the candidate will be
expected to undertake an additional research internship at the institute
for systems and robotics in instituto superior técnico, lisbon. the
internship is foreseen for a period of 3-4 months starting around may 2014.

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

2208,2014,phd and postdoc research grants cognitive interaction technology,"graduate school cognitive interaction technology - call for application 2014
research grants for phd students and postdocs

citec's goal are technical systems that are capable of cognitive 
interaction: this means the ability to interact with humans in 
situations and assist them for tasks that require some cognitive 
understanding of the context. moreover those systems need to integrate 
abilities such as shared attention, perception-guided planning and 
control of actions, situated communication and learning. given that the 
most advanced integration of such capabilities is seen in living 
systems, citec connects research groups in computer science and robotics 
with researchers and groups from biology, linguistics, mathematics, 
physics, psychology and sport science. individual groups cooperate in a 
highly interdisciplinary research institute established through the 
german excellence initiative and funded since 2007.

up to 16 research grants (3 years duration, tax free research 
fellowship) for highly qualified students aiming to obtain a ph.d. in 
one of the above fields and thematic areas are offered by the graduate 
school cognitive interaction technology. the graduate school is embedded 
within citec, offering a structured study program (intelligent systems) 
and providing access to premier lab and research facilities. grants are 
also available as shorter postdoctoral research positions (2 years work 
contract or tax free research fellowship) for suitably qualified 
candidates.

eligible candidates must hold an excellent academic degree 
(msc/diploma/phd) in one of the disciplines listed above (or related). 
applications should include: (1) a cover letter indicating motivation 
and research interests, (2) a cv including list of publications, (3) all 
relevant certificates of academic qualification, and (4) contact details 
of two referees. in addition (5) a short outline (2-3 pages) of a 
research project relevant to citec's research objectives including a 
corresponding abstract. while we strongly advise phd candidates to 
contact a prospective supervisor among the citec group head's 
(www.cit-ec.de/researchgroups) in order to jointly identify a suitable 
topic for the phd project outline in advance of the application (e.g., 
to clarify availability of special equipment), this step is optional for 
postdoc researchers who may directly submit the outline (not longer than 
5 pages) of their intended research project.

research grants will be given for the duration of three years for phd 
students/two years for postdoctoral applicants. bielefeld university is 
an equal opportunity employer.

2209,2014,"phd position in ""uncertainty in computer vision"" - oxford brookes university - dr fabio cuzzolin","*faculty of technology, design and environment*

*oxford brookes university - phd studentship*





the department of computing and communications technologies at oxford
brookes university is pleased to offer a three year full-time phd
studentship to a new student commencing in june 2014. the successful
applicant will receive an annual bursary of £10,000 for three years (with
no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the universty.



the successful candidate will work within the artificial intelligence and
vision group of the department of computing and communication technologies,
under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin.



topic of research: *uncertainty in computer vision*



decision making and estimation are central in most applied sciences, as the
need often arises to make inferences about the state of the external world,
based on information which is at best limited, if not downright misleading.
uncertainty can be dealt with in a number of ways. generative probabilistic
graphical models, which describe how the data are generated via classical
distribution functions, are most used for complex, multi-person activity
recognition. discriminative models which do not attempt to model data
generation, but focus on learning how to discriminate between data
belonging to different categories or classes, are dominant in action and
gesture recognition, in which we aim at recognising human actions based on
a limited training set of examples, captured via conventional or range
cameras. imprecise-probabilistic models which assume the data is
probabilistic but insufficient to estimate a precise probability
distribution, have been successfully employed in example-based human pose
estimation. depending on the problem we need to tackle, we might need to
consider metric learning techniques for generative models, latent svm
part-based discriminative approaches, or a meaningful integration of the
two.



the successful candidate will work on both the theoretical development and
the application of these techniques to scenarios such as the interaction
with a humanoid robot able to recognise and mimic natural human gesturing,
the retrieval of videos from internet repositories such as youtube, the
monitoring of the health of people affected by brain conditions in their
own homes, via range sensors such as kinect.

2210,2014,phd position in robotic rehabilitation at ntu singapore,"direct modulation of brain plasticity after stroke by the synergistic action
of robot aided rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation

the main focus of the project is to develop a novel paradigm to boost motor
recovery through targeted manipulation of brain activity via the coordinated
effort of non-invasive brain stimulation (nibs) and robot aided
rehabilitation (rar). the present proposed research aims to drastically
change the present understanding of human/robot interaction and
rehabilitation: the goal is to produce a new physical substrate for
rehabilitation and assistive technology with higher levels of embedded
intelligence and a direct intervention on brain plasticity. the application
of brain stimulation after stroke is mainly based on the concept of tipping
the balance between the hemispheres to recover the lost balance. recent
findings suggested that inhibition of the hyper excitability of the motor
cortex in the unaffected hemisphere by the application of repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms), may help to improve recovery of
functions of the affected limb after stroke. we want to propose a combined
approach using rar coupled with nibs: scope of the phd student’s work is to
use and refine our existing high performance robotic devices, for wrist and
hand manipulation, to implement therapeutic exercises with the synchronized
application of nibs and consequently manipulating the plasticity of the two
hemispheres on stroke subjects during the acute phase of the recovery
process. by introducing extensive clinical trials in collaboration with nuh
(national university hospital, nus, singapore), the final goal is to equip
clinicians with a novel rehabilitation technology and a more efficient and
targeted paradigm to qualify and quantify the different components of motor
recovery in those patients treated by rar and nibs techniques.
prospective applicants with interest in the project are encouraged to
contact the supervisor and/or the co-supervisors directly, before making a
formal application.

2211,2014,"phd position in robotics/biomechanics at ntu, singapore","one fully-funded phd position (4 years) is available at the school of
mechanical and aerospace engineering, ntu, singapore. the position
description is below. note however that the successful candidate will
enjoy a large freedom of research (and also an attentive guidance by the
supervisers).

*biomechanics of running : a robotics perspective*

the objective of this thesis is to provide a novel understanding of the
interaction between the foot and the ground during running and to build
upon this understanding to design a robotic device to test running shoes.

to reproduce the dynamics of the foot/ground interaction during human
running in a way faithful enough to fit the purpose of reliably testing
running shoes, it is necessary to understand the biomechanics of running
from a robotics perspective. for instance, a particularly important
concept for the control of robotic devices that undergo heavy
interactions with the environment is that of mechanical impedance.
indeed, the separate knowledge of the foot velocity pattern on one hand
and of the contact forces on the other is not sufficient to determine
the mechanical interaction between the foot and the ground: it is
precisely their relationship – as captured by the mechanical impedance –
that matters if one is to build a robotic device that aims at
reproducing this mechanical interaction. note also that this mechanical
impedance should not be understood only at the foot/ground interaction,
but also throughout the whole “robotic leg”.

the first part of the proposed phd thesis will consist in the study –
through both experiments and simulations – of the foot/ground
interaction and of the dynamics of the whole leg during contact, in
light of concepts arising from robotics, such as that of mechanical
impedance mentioned above. the second part will consist in the faithful
reproduction of the foot/ground interaction through the design of a
novel robotic device based on the knowledge gained in the first part. we
believe that such a program can bring about a novel understanding of the
biomechanics of running, as well as a new shoes-testing device able to
reproduce the foot/ground interaction at a level of fidelity that no
existing apparatus can reach.

finally, the results obtained in the first part can also be used in
other sport contexts which involve heavy interactions between human
limbs and the environment, such as arm/racket/ball interaction in tennis
or foot/ball interaction in football.

*requirements*

we are seeking candidates with a master or bachelor degree in
engineering (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, computer science,
biomedical), physiology, physics or mathematics. familiarity with
concepts from biomechanics, mechanical design, control theory or
robotics would be appreciated, but we are interested above all in
students with sharp critical reasoning and strong background in mathematics.

this phd will be conducted at the school of mechanical and aerospace

2226,2014,"second call for a phd position at the max planck institute for biological cybernetics, tuebingen, germany","apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement.

*[important note]* please be advised that the deadline to apply for this
phd position is *31st march 2014*.

*foreword*
the max planck society (mps) is germany's most successful research
organization. since its establishment in 1948, it has produced 17 nobel
laureates from the ranks of its scientists, putting it on a par with the
best and most prestigious research institutions worldwide.  max planck
institutes are built up solely around the world's leading researchers. the
max planck institute for biological cybernetics (mpi-kyb) at tübingen,
germany, is one of the 82 independently organized research facilities of
the mps that carry out basic research in the service of the general public
in the fields of natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and
humanities. the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, directed by prof. dr. heinrich h. bülthoff, studies human
perception with the help of virtual reality (vr). this enables the
experiments to be conducted in a controlled and yet natural surroundings
for which there are special hardware and experimental constructions. among
the several state-of-the-art laboratories at mpi-kyb is the cyberneum, a vr
research facility equipped with several sophisticated vr systems that
provide unique opportunities to study human perception and human-machine
interactions. the autonomous robotics and human-machine systems (ar-hms)
group, within the department of human perception, cognition and action at
mpi-kyb, opens a phd position for motivated candidates with excellent
qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,
multi-robot systems.

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.


*expected qualifications and skills of the candidate*

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical
   engineering, computer science or other related fields.
   - the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
   spoken language.
   - prior experience in computer vision and image processing is essential.
   - the candidate must have excellent programming skills in one or more
   languages, e.g., c, c++ and python.
   - knowledge and experience in robot operating system (ros) will be a
   plus.

*selection procedure*
interested candidates who meet the above mentioned requirements should send
the following documents (all in pdf format) to aahmad at isr.ist.utl.pt by
31st march, 2014

   - motivation letter.
   - curriculum vitae (including a list of publications)
   - online link to their own code snippets or softwares developed (these

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

2231,2014,three (3) marie curie early stage research fellowships at istituto italiano di tecnologia,"bc: 69409- 69410- 69411

marie curie early stage researcher



job title:  marie curie fellow



post: position with an enrolment on a doctoral training programme



the department of advanced robotics (advr) at the istituto italiano di tecnologia - iit (an english speaking institute) located in genoa is seeking to appoint 3 marie curie early stage researchers (esr) in the framework of the

fp7 marie curie itn smart-e (sustainable manufacturing through advanced robotics training in europe).



smart-e is a doctoral training network, funded by the eu commission’s fp7 marie curie programme, with the aim to prepare the next generation of leading experts in advanced robotics to secure a sustainable manufacturing sector in europe.



the network involves the collaboration of eight european institutions - the university of salford, university of zurich, scuola superiore sant'anna, istituto italiano di tecnologia, technical university of munich, festo, airbus and advanced manufacturing research centre at the university of sheffield.



the network is bringing together leading experts in the field of embodied intelligence, compliant, soft robotics, advanced manufacturing, industrial robotics and automation, smart materials and machine learning in europe. you will utilise new technologies (mostly pioneered by smart-e) in state of the art training environments.



the successful candidate will benefit from high quality industrial experience

and interdisciplinary projects that are individually tailored.    the research

training programme will combine technical expertise acquisition with business & leadership, communication and entrepreneurial skills in order to provide you with the skills, knowledge and confidence to tackle not only the technical challenges, but also to play a key role in embedding/deploying these solutions into practical applications.



the researchers will have at least 2 placements outside of their host organisation; this may entail a short stay outside their host country.







theme 1: development and control of robot manipulators for safer physical human robot interaction.

the focus of this research is the design optimization, development and control of a novel compliant manipulator and related actuation systems with variable physical damping actuators (vpda,

http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/variable-physical-damping-actuators.html)

for robust, fast, adaptable and damage-safe motions and interactions. the target is to improve the capabilities of the existing compact(tm) arm

(http://www.iit.it/en/robots/compact-arm.html) by exploring both the mechatronic technological limits (structural materials, actuation and sensing) and new design and control philosophies towards the development of high performance manipulation systems. the department of advanced robotics at iit possesses a strong industrial know how in this field  with 5+ patents.

in detail, the main goals of the project are to:

*     improve via technology and develop actuators that are more robust, more

stable, have reduced oscillatory behaviour, lower cost, have less friction and wear, etc.

*     focus on the introduction of, and improvements in, other physical

impedance parameters, e.g. damping or effective inertia through techniques originally developed for the vpda,

*     build a prototype of the upper body of a robot for physically

interactive manipulation testing and to compare mature technologies for lightweight robots (kuka lwr) with via and vpda technologies.

the resulting developed systems will be capable of:

*     more safely co‐existing and co‐operating with people (co-workers)

and other robots;

*     attain performance levels more commonly associated with humans.

theme 2: development of a high performance haptic tele-manipulation system interaction between humans and machines, particularly safe interaction, is a critical aspect of robotics. the focus of this research is the development of high fidelity user interfaces for telepresence and teleoperation that can rival the human hand in terms of manipulating dexterity, see http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/haptic-and-interaction-technologies.html. within this research new haptic technologies and techniques will be applied to the control and operation of the coman humanoid

(http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html)

and particular to the development of a high performance, teleoperation system that will use enhanced levels of haptic feedback to ensure accurate, high precision and dexterous control and manipulation of remote objects using a coman as the remote system.

the main goals of the project are to:

*     enhance the nature of the operator interface at the remote and the user

site

o     at the remote site to use a compliant torque controlled robot arm to

improve control accuracy,

o     at the user site to develop high accuracy hand exoskeletons, finger tip

tactile displays and tele-impedance control to augment the user experience and improve transparency.

within the framework of a teleoperation platform the esr will work on:

*     development of algorithms for visual, haptic and tactile feedback,

*     spatial mapping between the human hand and the robot hand and

*     addressing the time delay of the teleoperation system.



for further information on this topic contact ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it<mailto:ioannis.sarakoglou at iit.it>







theme 3: dexterous human-robot collaborative manipulation through learning using compliant robots within unstructured spaces the recent development of compliant robots such as coman

(http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html)

has opened up a host of new research possibilities in human-robot interaction and robot learning. now, robots need not be behind fences (as in large manufacturing plants), and are increasingly capable of executing tasks in collaboration with human users. such human-robot collaboration requires drastic changes in the way robots move, learn, react, and physically interact with the users and environment and this flexibility should be in the software as much as the hardware, i.e. flexibility through learning.

this work will address research themes related to the problem of transferring bimanual collaborative manipulation skills to robots in a user-friendly manner.

such skills involve rich and diverse research questions such as passive/active roles switching, leader/follower behaviours, specialization, turn-taking, compliance, inter-agent synchronization, action anticipation, intention recognition in joint action and the use of non-verbal cues to communicate intent. these issues will be studied in two contexts: 1) with bidirectional social teaching interaction with the compliant humanoid robot coman; 2) within a manufacturing scenario with an innovative setup based on two 7 dofs compliant manipulators with sensorized hands.

the goals of the project are to:

*     develop a dexterous semi-autonomous teleoperation schemes for compliant

robot operating in not well defined spaces with uncertain physical interactions.

*     cope and learn to adapt to collisions and physical interactions .

*     exploration of haptics in teleoperation of compliant robots  for

improving performance as well for providing guidance to the operator in the context of bidirectional coupling.

*     development of data and knowledge fusion technique for the dexterous

manipulation to learn how to detect collisions and react to physical interactions

*     development of a refined control model for flexible regulation of

stiffness and damping behaviours of the compliant robot

qualifications.


*motivation*as robots increasingly become a part of daily life in our
society, there is a preeminent need for the robots to be able to perceive
humans in a more implicit manner in order to make human-robot interaction
as natural as possible. for instance, in crowded urban environments, robots
must use their own vision (or a network of sensors in the environment) to
distinguish between those humans who require the robot's attention for some
cooperative/collaborative purpose and those humans who simply occupy the
same environment for other possible reasons. such visual classification
based on gesture recognition, emotion detection, etc., should precede any
subsequent direct interaction (e.g., verbal) between the robot and a human
in order to make the overall human-robot interaction natural and less
complicated for the untrained human users of the robots. simultaneously,
diverse vision-based functionalities in robots are essential to accomplish
complex tasks by human-robot or robot-only teams that involve interaction
and/or collaboration. such functionalities can range from simpler ones,
e.g., single object or person detection, recognition and tracking using a
single static camera to more complex ones, e.g., tracking multitude of
people in crowded and highly dynamic environments and at the same time
perceiving the emotional response of humans with whom the robot is directly
interacting. thanks to networked robot systems (nrs), presence of multiple
mobile sensors (e.g., micro aerial vehicles equipped with camera) or static
sensors (e.g., wall/ceiling mounted network cameras) provide a strong
foundation to tackle such complex functionalities for real time
applications. the focus of this thesis will, therefore, be on the issues of
scalability and real time applicability of multiple vision-based
functionalities in an nrs where human-robot interaction is one of the most
essential components.

*keywords*
sensor fusion, cooperative perception, person tracking; detection and
tracking from non-inertial frames; face and gesture recognition;
stereo-vision systems; motion capture systems; human-robot interaction,
multi-robot systems.

 *summary of global objectives*
 expected objectives of this phd thesis are:

   - to conceptualize and develop a framework that hierarchically
   integrates person detection, classification and tracking with face and
   gesture recognition, within an nrs that consists of human-sized mobile
   robots, micro aerial vehicles, static sensors in the environment and humans
   cooperating with the robot in an urban environmental setting. primary focus
   will be on indoor scenarios.
   - to conceptualize and develop novel algorithms for the vision-based
   functionalities embedded within the above mentioned framework. the major
   focus here will be on the scalability issues of those algorithms such that
   they are applicable to extremely large environments consisting of a high
   number of static and mobile sensors. applicability refers to computational
   feasibility in real time while simultaneously maintaining optimality of the
   solution.


*expected qualifications and skills of the candidate*

   - we seek highly qualified candidates with a master degree in one of the
   following broad areas: robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical
   engineering, computer science or other related fields.
   - the candidate should have fluent command of english as a written and
   spoken language.
   - prior experience in computer vision and image processing is essential.
   - the candidate must have excellent programming skills in one or more
   languages, e.g., c, c++ and python.
   - knowledge and experience in robot operating system (ros) will be a
   plus.

*selection procedure*
interested candidates who meet the above mentioned requirements should send
the following documents as soon as possible (all in pdf format) to
aahmad at isr.ist.utl.pt

   - motivation letter.
   - curriculum vitae (including a list of publications)
   - online link to their own code snippets or softwares developed (these
   can be inserted as a section in the cv).
   - a 2-page summary of their master thesis or any other research results
   (which they consider as their most important results) (bibliography should
   not be within these 2-page limit)
   - copy of the last diploma and transcripts (grade sheet).

selected candidate will be expected to enroll in the phd program in the
beginning of september 2014 at the university of tübingen and will carry
out their research work at max planck institute for biological cybernetics,
tübingen. however, prior to the phd enrollment, the candidate will be
expected to undertake an additional research internship at the institute
for systems and robotics in instituto superior técnico, lisbon. the
internship is foreseen for a period of 3-4 months starting around may 2014.

*brief description of work*

in the context of this phd thesis work, a network robot system (nrs) will
consist of i) a mobile robot with an omni-directional chassis equipped with
vision sensors and simple actuators (arm/gripper), ii) multiple micro
aerial vehicles (mavs), and iii) static sensors fixed within the
environment, e.g., network cameras.

*highly scalable sensor fusion*

 to achieve robust vision-based functionalities through an nrs, one needs
to perform optimal sensor fusion. however, as environments scale up in size
and feature-richness, the amount of visual information that needs to be
processed becomes overwhelmingly high. consequently, performing sensor
fusion optimally and in real-time becomes exponentially heavy. one good
example is how the number of particles required by a particle filter-based
(an approximately optimal technique) object tracker grow exponentially with
the increase of the state space dimension to maintain a given accuracy of
the tracker. nevertheless, there are possible ways, e.g, exploiting
dependencies between state variables, through which an increase in
computational complexity can be restricted. in this phd work, such
techniques will be explored to develop highly scalable sensor fusion
algorithms.

*implicit-and-explicit interaction*

another major focus of this work is to investigate methods for implicit
human-robot interaction. here, implicit interaction refers to embodied
communication between humans and robots. robots' understanding of human
body/hand gestures, visual cues and human emotions based on facial
expressions and body posture are among some forms of embodied communication
that would eventually make human-robot interaction more fluid and natural.
to this end, state-of-the-art vision-based techniques will be investigated
for human body/hand gestures and emotion detection. indeed, taking
advantage of an nrs will facilitate the detection process, however,
innovative algorithms must be developed for fusing visual information
through various sensors available in the environment for this purpose.

on the other hand, explicit interaction between humans and robots involve
activities such as voice-based communication, touch screen-based
communication, etc. humans naturally use both implicit and explicit form of
communication in a general interaction. to this effect, fusion of visual
information with that obtained through speech (microphones) and touch
(touch screen) will be made. a hierarchical information fusion architecture
will form the backbone of such human-robot interaction method.

*case studies*

real robot implementation of the algorithms developed during this phd
thesis will be made in the following contexts: i) a domestic service robot
(with an omni-directional mobile base) assisting an elderly person at home
where the home environment will consist of static sensors as well as
multiple mavs with on-board sensors. ii) a service robot (same platform as
in the first case study) assisting shoppers in a supermarket where the
environment consists of several other robots of the same kind, multiple
mavs and static sensors.

investigate the benefits of impedance control to finesse finishing tasks and
possibly devise ad-hoc end-of-arm tooling to implement such schemes.

multiple positions are available immediately at research fellow (postdoc)
and research associate (ms degree holder) levels. an ntu phd scholarship is
also made available for the august 2015 in-take.

the ideal candidates should have demonstrated experience in robotics, in
particular impedance control, possibly with the new generation of compliant
robots. while a solid background in control is expected, experimental
experience robotic systems involved in contact tasks would be highly
preferred.

2249,2014,one postdoc position in bci motor mapping in inria south france,"postdoctoral position: adaptive brain-motor mapping

  neuroprosthetics is an interdisciplinary field related to 
neuroscience, bioelectronics and biomedical engineering, which aims to 
substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive function that might have been 
damaged as a result of an injury or a disease. one of the challenging 
issues in motor prosthesis is the large variety of patient situations 
depending on the type of neurological disorder. to overcome the current 
limited performance of such systems, a robust bio-signal processing and 
a model-based control taking about the actual sensory motor state with 
biosignal feedback would bring a break-through and allow to progress 
toward adaptive neuroprosthesis.
 recent advances of brain-computer-interfaces (bci) have opened a new 
communication channel for patients, who can transmit their movement 
intention via brain signals. 
the functionality and controllability of motor prosthesis can be further 
improved by taking advantage of computational mapping between emg 
(electromyography) of muscle, eeg (electroencephalography) of brain, and 
other modalities of biofeedback information.

the first objective is to enhance the classification algorithm to 
extract the subject's motor intention from eeg signal in motor-imagery 
based bci. the computational modeling between multichannel emg and eeg 
will involve advanced feature extraction, dimension reduction and 
classification algorithms. moreover emg signals of multiple muscles and 
muscle modeling including skeletal dynamics models will help in 
obtaining the detailed motion intention of the subject.

the second objective is to develop a bilateral learning architecture. in 
bci, adaptive decoding of eeg signals is desirable because brain signals 
change over time during the learning of the task. in motor control, it 
is also known that we change how we use our joints and a way to deal 
with redundancy problems in articulation. in emg analysis, the change of 
motor usage can be captured. adaptive modeling of emg allows the 
evaluation of skill acquisition.

by jointly analyzing both the eeg and emg modifications, we investigate 
how eeg signal may change along with actual motor coordination changes. 
by modeling both of these adaptive features, this framework will try to 
capture the bilateral learning architecture of both the brain and the 
motor system.

this project is associated with inria openvibe project (http://openvibe.inria.fr/
)

required skills: a strong background in signal processing, control, and 
machine learning is required. fluency in english, and excellent 
programming skills (c++ and matlab) are necessary.

2250,2014,ph.d. in bio-inspired robotics and sensing applied to remotely operated robotic arms,"ph.d. in bio-inspired robotics and sensing applied to remotely operated
robotic arms

in recent years, significant advances were made in the field of
bio-inspired sensing (with application to robotics). among other
achievements, researchers have managed to emulate the electric sensing
capacities of weakly electric fish. the developed technology was
successfully applied to enhance unmanned vehicles' perception of their
environment. the bio-inspired robotics group at irccyn has played a key
role in such developments, in particular through the european fet project
angels.

in parallel, the last decades have seen a rapid development of technologies
related to remotely operated robotics. the interactive robotics laboratory
(lri, part of cea list) has been a prominent contributor to this field, in
particular through its work on remotely operated robotic arms. applications
of interest involve manipulation in hostile environments, where the
operator uses a master arm (from a safe location) to remotely control
movements of a slave arm (operating in a hazardous environment).

some of the more stringent limitations of remotely operated robotics
technology are directly linked to difficulties in providing the operator
with a complete and detailed representation of the remotely operated arm's
direct environment. the offered research project proposes to transcend such
limitations through the use of novel, bio-inspired sensing modalities, in
particular that of the aforementioned electric sense. in practice, an
active electric sensor will be used to generate an electric field around
the remotely operated arm. presence of foreign objects (obstacles) within
this field will be detected, and the user made aware of detection through
adjustment of the force feedback response of the master arm. applications
considered include robotic arms operating in (typically turbid) water, but
also in the air.

this ph.d. position provides an excellent opportunity for an outstanding,
motivated student, with a strong background in robotics and sensing, to
work, learn and develop in direct contact with research groups
internationally recognized in the field of bio-inspired robotics and
remotely operated robotics. candidates with background in automatic control
theory, dynamical system theory, and/or applied mechatronics will receive
special consideration.

2272,2014,two open phd position @ robert bosch gmbh coporate research,"in the corporate research division ""software intensive systems"" of the bosch group in stuttgart area, germany, there are currently two open phd positions in the same line of research:

1) verification of hybrid systems:

many innovations in bosch products and services are based on embedded software that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators. the correctness of the resulting system -- software interacting with its environment -- is a chief success factor.

a suitable model for such software-intensive systems is the hybrid system model that comprises continuous and discrete aspects of a system. hybrid systems allow us to model, specify and verify diverse system classes such as several industrial robots, e.g., for autonomous land mower and production assistants. thus, verification of hybrid systems is a crucial technology. the goal of this dissertation is to transfer current research results into an industrial environment with additional constraints such as scalability and integration into a development process.

- modeling (for verification) of industrial systems as hybrid systems
- analysis of different verification methods based on modeled examples
- development of techniques and methods for scalability and usability of verification methods
- connection of formal verification methods to approaches for testing and runtime monitoring

more details under: www.bosch-career.com<http://www.bosch-career.com>, reference: de00274028

2) robotic systems and software engineering

bosch offers a number of products and services in robotics, from the indego lawn mower to the apas production assistant. our robotics researchers explore several new application areas and are actively involved in a couple of public funded research projects. of course, this research is also closely connected to the extensive r&d activities on automated and autonomous driving.

amongst others, we are investigating model-based methods for robotics software development, including behavioral aspects such as decision making and task planning. model-based methods not only increase the development efficiency but also allow for early verification and thus improve the quality of robotic systems. a crucial question thereby is how to treat the inherent uncertainty of sensor data in such methods.

- advance and apply academic research results on modeling robotic system behavior with uncertainty-aware logics.
- develop a domain-specific reasoning framework for robotic applications at bosch.
- research algorithmic foundations for automatic generation of reasoning engines for real-time decision making in a safety-critical context.

----------------------
thematic:

this thesis is in the field of medical robotics and focuses on the 
development of solutions for tracking the deformations of organs using 
medical imaging devices based on scanning imaging technologies 
(ultrasound and oct). the interest is to allow future implementation of 
robotic applications for assistance during minimally invasive surgical 
procedures, such as needle insertion for biopsies, localized treatment 
of tumors [1] or in the context of minimally or non-invasive surgical 
microrobotics. to this end, taking into account tissue deformations due 
to the patient's physiological movement and physical interaction of 
surgical instruments with the targeted anatomical element is a crucial 
step to ensure a safe and effective robotic assistance [2].

----------------------
context:

ultrasound imaging and oct can provide 3d ​​images in real-time in 
opposite to magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and are not invasive for 
the patient in contrast to x-ray imaging. therefore these imaging 
modalities are well appropriated to allow biopsies and surgical 
procedures in interventional radiology [3].

3d ultrasound and oct work on a very similar principle that consists in 
sending an ultrasonic or optical infrared (for oct) wave along a scan 
line and measuring the signal that is reflected by the interfaces of 
tissue traversed by the wave. the 3d image is then reconstructed by 
automaticallysweeping the wave along successive scanning lines on the 
area of ​​interest.

however the scanning is performed sequentially thanks to an 
electronic/mechanical sweeping which produces artifacts in the 
reconstructed image in case the observed anatomical structure moves and 
deforms due to the physiological motion of the patient.
----------------------

research work:

this thesis will focus on the development of an approach able to 
compensate these artifacts by controlling the sweeping in a clever 
manner that will allow a more accurate tracking of the organ 
deformations [4]. the idea is to control the direction of each scanning 
line in order it intersects on specific points in soft tissue and to use 
the wave response time to directly estimate the motion speed of the 
anatomical structure. to this end, we plan to use a preoperative digital 
model of the targeted organ acquired by mri or ct. the deformation of 
the model will be online adapted during the intraoperative imaging 
performed with ultrasound or oct thanks to observations obtained during 
the monitored sweeping of the wave.
----------------------

expected results:

the main contribution of this thesis would be a novel approach that 
automatically performs an intraoperative registration of a deformable 
model with an observed soft tissue structure while compensating the 
artifacts induced by the scanning imaging technology.
----------------------

competence:

knowledge in computer vision and applied mathematics are required, as 
well as good programming skills in c++.

robot navigation testing in virtual worlds

laas-cnrs seeks to hire an outstanding doctoral researcher in robotics and dependability in toulouse, france. the successful candidate will collaborate with the ris (robotics) and tsf (dependability) teams to develop a systematic method for simulation-based testing of autonomous robot software.

an autonomous robot should perform a variety of tasks without any human supervision, in various, complex and uncertain environments. in order to deploy such systems in human or critical environments, rigorous validation is of paramount importance. the tests, for safety and cost constraints, must first be realized using simulation in virtual worlds. morse (modular openrobots simulation engine) is a simulator developed at laas-cnrs to serve that purpose. it provides the right level of simulation (perception/action) to validate the execution of complex plans. the objective of the phd work is to develop a test method that exploits such simulation facilities to place the robotic system in a wide variety of operational situations and observe how it faces them. the method will be based on the automated generation of virtual worlds, like worlds generated in video games. the main contribution will be on how to synthesize the virtual worlds in such a way that they exhibit the safety-relevant corner cases, and ensure adequate coverage of the functionalities deployed on the robot. the method will be applied to navigation functionalities developed in genom, which are deployed on real mobile robots at laas. a demonstrator will be implemented using the morse simulator.

desired profile and role
-----------------------
the candidate is expected to:
- have a master in computer science,
- have some background and interest in robotics and/or software validation,
- be fluent in english (written and spoken).

the main tasks of the phd student will be to:
- get acquainted with the morse robots simulator and the genom3 module generator tool
- propose a framework for morse world generation and selection according to test criteria
- define plans and scripts which will be tested in simulation
- conduct a case study and evaluate the proposed solution

please note that iit is an english-language research institute, so it is not required to speak italian.

there are two phd positions open for themes 21 and 22.
both are in the area of robot learning, as described below.

-----------------------------------------------------

theme 21. robot learning of motor skills
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, prof. darwin g. caldwell

description: despite the significant mechatronic advances in robot design, the motor skill repertoire of current robots is mediocre compared to their biological counterparts. motor skills of humans and animals are still utterly astonishing when compared to robots. this phd theme will focus on machine learning methods to advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning of motor skills. the type of motor skills that will be investigated include object manipulation, compliant interaction with objects, humans and the environment, force control and vision as part of the robot learning architecture.

the creation of novel, high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed at iit) offers a significant potential for achieving such advances in motor skills. however, as the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, the main efforts should be directed towards the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, new solutions should be sought to address the challenge of compliant robot control.

ideas from developmental robotics will be considered, in search for a qualitatively better approach for controlling robots, different than the currently predominant approach based on manually-engineered controllers.
the work within this phd theme will include developing novel robot learning algorithms and methods that allow humanoid robots to easily learn new skills. at the same time, the methods should allow for natural and safe interaction with people. to this end, the research will include learning by imitation and reinforcement learning, as well as human-robot interaction.

-----------------------------------------------------

theme 22. robot learning for agile locomotion
tutors: dr. petar kormushev, dr. nikos tsagarakis

description: the state-of-the-art high-performance, passively-compliant humanoid robots (such as the robot coman developed by iit) offer a significant potential for achieving more agile robot locomotion. at this stage, the bottleneck is not the hardware anymore, but the software that controls the robot. it is no longer reasonable to use over-simplified models of robot dynamics, because the novel compliant robots possess much richer and more complex dynamics than the previous generation of stiff robots. therefore, a new solution should be sought to address the challenge of compliant humanoid robot control.

in this phd theme, the use of machine learning and robot learning methods will be explored, in order to achieve novel ways for whole-body compliant humanoid robot control. in particular, the focus will be on achieving agile locomotion, based on robot self-learned dynamics, rather than on pre-engineered dynamics model. the phd candidates will be expected to develop new algorithms for robot learning and to advance the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot locomotion.

the expected outcome of these efforts includes the realization of highly dynamic bipedal locomotion such as omni-directional walking on uneven surfaces, coping with multiple contacts with the environments, jumping and running robustly on uneven terrain and in presence of high uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and tolerance to external disturbances, etc. the ultimate goal will be achieving locomotion skills comparable to a 1.5 - 2 year-old child.

remote robotic manipulation requires integration of perception, cognition,
and action within and between the human and robot agents. we aim at
advancing the understanding of human motor control in remote manipulation
tasks and using this knowledge for the development of improved telerobotic
systems. we will construct two telerobotic systems along with a virtual
experiment with similar characteristics. the two telerobotic setups will
consist of local manipulators that control a remote:  industrial robot and
surgical robot.

together, these systems form a setup for testing hypotheses about human
sensorimotor control and their implication on robotic systems design and
control in a variety of complicated, real-life tasks. we focus on remote
manipulation of soft objects with haptic feedback, which is of great
importance for dexterous manipulation of soft, deformable objects, taking
into account the specific requirements of the industrial and medical
applications.

the objective of this project is to develop the next generation of vision-aided inertial navigation systems (vins) for performing resource-aware, large-scale 3d localization and mapping on mobile devices (cell phones, tablets, and wearables) within highly-dynamic environments.

accomplishing this task requires precisely modeling and calibrating visual and inertial sensors, reliably extracting low (e.g., geometric primitives) and high (e.g., place id and semantics) level visual information, and efficiently solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems. but most of all, it requires a profound understanding of the relation between the information extracted from sensor data and the processing resources expended, as well as bright new ideas for how the information gain can be maximized through the introduction and solution of insightful problem relaxations.

required qualifications:
excellent knowledge of:
geometric computer vision
optimization theory
numerical linear algebra
excellent  programming skills (c++ under linux)
excellent communication skills

additional desired qualifications/knowledge:
estimation theory
algebraic geometry
experience working with rgbd sensors
basic understanding of inertial sensing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- postdoc 2: human-robot coordinated manipulations and transportation of large objects; sponsor: nsf, national robotics initiative

the objective of this project is to develop the science and technology necessary for realizing human-robot cooperative object manipulation and transportation. accomplishing this goal requires adaptability to human activity and robustness to variability and uncertainty in the environment. the embodiment of this research will be a humanoid co-worker that helps a person carry an object while bearing most of the load. this robot will accomplish its goal without excessive communication or prior training on the part of the human.

**************************

apologize for multiple postings

 

applications to the phd in bioengineering and robotics - università degli
studi di genova are open!

 

the phd program in biogengineering and robotics is rooted in the multiple
ongoing collaborations between università degli studi di genova/university
of genoa ( <http://www.unige.it/> www.unige.it), fondazione istituto
italiano di tecnologia/italian institute of technology foundation (
<http://www.iit.it/> www.iit.it) and the university of cagliari (
<http://www.unica.it/> www.unica.it) 

 

deadline for application (strict): 22/08/2014 - 12:00 (noon). 

more information on the phd program, its curricula, research themes, and
application modalities can be found at http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/
and http://www.iit.it/en/openings/phd-calls/2015.html.

 

within the program, i would like to draw your attention on the following
research theme, highly interdisciplinary, with elements of computer science,
cognitive science and robotics, and very ambitious in its scope: 

 

learning visual cues of interactions for humanoid robots

theme n. 10 - curriculum on “cognitive sciences, interactive and
rehabilitation technologies”.  

tutors: prof. francesca odone  (dibris università dei genova) prof. giulio
sandini (rbcs dept., iit), dr. alessandra sciutti (rbcs dept., iit)

 

description: since the earliest stage of their development, humans learn how
to interact with other people. more specifically, babies begin to decode
their own movements by acquiring visual evidence of the result of their
motor commands. then, as soon as they learn to perform a given action they
also start to anticipate its outcome even when they see it executed by
others. hence, the knowledge accumulated by acting is exploited to
understand and predict someone else’s intention. 

 

the general goal of this project will be to provide icub with a similar
ability that will guarantee a more natural and proficient interaction with
human users. the pipeline of the computational system includes an
attentional module able to localize the portion of the scene containing
biological motion. then, icub exploits this information to focus on the
selected area and to describe it more precisely using its stereo system. 

 the visual properties of the observed movements will be used by the robot
to decode the intentionality of the interacting partner by using machine
learning techniques. view-invariance will be one of the crucial aspects of
the system, together with the capability of inferring information about the
3d orientation of an agent.

dear all.

in the context of the robotics and autonomous systems curriculum of the 
phd program in bioengineering and robotics, i would like to advertise 
the following themes:

** theme 1: biologically inspired approaches to perception, knowledge 
representation and action in robotics

goals:

1) design, develop and validate a framework allowing a bi-manual robot 
to learn bio-inspired, neural-based representation structures related to 
real-world objects using force, vision and proprioceptive information.

2) use the developed representation structures to assess knowledge 
encoded in suitable neural spaces, in order to reason about goals, plans 
and actions. representation structures will refer to capabilities (i.e., 
what a robot gains in considering them) and affordances (i.e., what 
possible actions they entail).

3) provide the robot with means to carry out planned actions while 
monitoring their execution at run-time to implement multi-modal 
sensory-motor couplings.

** theme 8: spatial, temporal and common sense reasoning in robots

goals:

1) design and develop innovative techniques to represent heterogeneous 
and multi-modal sensory data. such data will encode real-world objects 
and events the robot perceives and interact with, taking into account 
both spatial and temporal features.

2) investigate novel (software) architectures and planning frameworks 
for action (including the use of language) able to exhibit integrated 
(task-level) symbolic and continuous planning capabilities, as well as 
to modify and adapt the robot representation structures and planning 
schemes on the basis of its experience.

* theme 3, cooperation/competition in a haptic dyad

there is a growing interest in physical coupling between humans. for example, it was found that haptic interaction with a human partner leads to a better performance than individuals in tasks involving either motor or force control. one reason may be that mutual haptic feedback can enhance the process of intention integration between the two partners at an implicit level. moreover, physical interactions are consistently beneficial to the interacting individuals and enable them to improve their motor performance both during and after interactive practice. this makes dyadic interaction extremely appealing from a motor learning perspective, since the use of paradigms that promote dyadic motor adaptation can be of great advantage during training and also in rehabilitation. however, it is not yet clear how dyadic physical interaction shapes motor adaptation and the mechanisms that mediate intention understanding are still poorly understood. a deeper knowledge in these areas is fundamental to advance into the development of haptic platforms for interactive systems and protocols for effective haptic communication, with the goal of modeling interactive strategies & adaptation mechanisms and ultimately designing in an optimal way haptic systems that support effective and versatile dyadic paradigms of physical interaction.

requirements: a degree in computer science engineering, bioengineering or equivalent, with high interests in human sciences. expertise in virtual reality, assistive technologies and haptics will constitute factors of preference.

2381,2014,phd position on tactile object exploration,"1 phd position with scholarship at the istituto italiano di tecnologia.

* theme 6, tactile object exploration.

recent advances in tactile sensing have renewed the interest in the
development of control strategies that exploit tactile feedback to control the
interaction between the robot and the environment. indeed, it has
been shown that tactile feedback can complement or even substitute for vision for
grasping, especially in those situations in which a model of the environment is not
available. in humans it is believed that haptic exploration is fundamental to generate
structured information to extract object properties like size, volume and shape.

the goal of this phd project is to implement on the icub strategies for object
exploration and grasping based primarily on haptic feedback. to this aim we will use
the sensory system of the icub which includes a system of tactile sensors (fingertips,
hands and arms) and force sensors. we will also study algorithms for extracting
haptic features during object exploration and apply them to the problem of object
recognition.

requirements: the ideal candidate would have a degree in computer science,
engineering or related disciplines; a background in control theory and machine
learning. he would also be highly motivated to work on robotic platform and have
computer programming skills.

2387,2014,phd positions on event-driven vision for icub,"1 phd position with scholarship the starting november 2014 at the icub facility, istituto italiano di tecnologia

* theme 3, event-driven vision for the icub

interacting with a dynamical environment is one of the major challenges of robotics. biology clearly outperforms robotic systems when acting in real scenarios in terms of appropriateness of the behavioural response, robustness to interference and noise, adaptation to ever changing environmental conditions, and energy efficiency. all these properties arise from the characteristics of the radically different style of sensing and computation used by the biological brain. 
in conventional robots, sensory information is available in a sequence of static snapshots and high dynamics can be sensed only by increasing the sampling rate.

however the available bandwidth limits the amount of information that can be transmitted forcing a compromise between resolution and speed. event-driven vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. the proposed theme aims at the exploitation of highly dynamical information from event-driven sensors for robust interaction of the humanoid robot icub with moving objects. the goal is to develop new techniques for the recognition and prediction of trajectories of moving targets including humans and objects and plan for precise reaching movements, by exploiting the high temporal resolution and compressive signal encoding of event-driven vision sensors mounted on the icub.
research will focus on the development of the infrastructure for handling eventdriven sensory data and of event-driven vision algorithms for motion estimation as well as algorithms for trajectory prediction. real time behaviour will be achieved by using compressive event driven computation and on-board processing on fpga.

2395,2014,post-doctoral position on vision for hri at the icub facility,"iit icub facility department (http://www.iit.it/icub) is looking for a post-doctoral researcher to work on the wysiwyd ""what you say is what you did"" eu project (http://goo.gl/twxr3s) funded by the european commission under the fp7 programme (fp7-ict-2013-10, grant agreement n. 612139). 

wysiwyd will create novel ""transparency"" in human robot interaction (hri) by allowing robots to understand both their and human actions and to interpret and communicate them in human compatible intentional terms expressed as a language-like communication channel. wysiwyd will contribute to a qualitative change in human-robot interaction (hri) and cooperation, unlocking new capabilities and application areas together with enhanced safety and robustness. in this context it is fundamental that robots perceive humans and understand their communicative intentions. however, the most successful vision-based strategies for people localization are developed for ""at distance"" scenarios. these techniques are not well suited for typical ""face-to-face"" hri, where human detection is made difficult by occlusions and large variability in pose and scale.

the research of this postdoctoral project aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art in terms of visual perception for hri. we are looking for a highly motivated young researcher with strong motivation to work jointly in computer vision and robotics. this project will be carried out on the icub robot with the aim of implementing efficient tools for the detection of human body parts by using computer vision. we will develop new methodologies for detecting human body parts at close distance such as torso, arms and face with the goal of determining the intention of the human (gaze direction, relative position, hands configuration etc.).

the contract will be issued within the icub facility in collaboration with the department of pattern analysis and computer vision (pavis).

we seek a candidate with the following skills:
- phd in robotics, computer vision or related areas;
- ability to analyse, improve and propose new algorithms;
- good knowledge and proven experience in c/c++ programming as well as familiarity with robotics middleware such as yarp, ros and development tools including cmake, and git.

an internationally competitive salary, dependent on experience, will be offered.

interested applicants should submit a cv and a list of publications. please send your application to jobpost.wysiwyd at icub.iit.it including at least 2 reference letters.

please apply before september 15th 2014.

2396,2014,postdoc opening at lirmm montpellier: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts,"laboratory: lirmm (cnrs/university montpellier 2), montpellier, france
department: robotics department
duration: 24 months (starting as soon as possible).
topic: design of a whole-body humanoid state observer to detect undesired contacts   

in the frame of the romeo 2 french national project lead by aldebaran, the topic of this postdoctoral position is to model and program a haptic observer returning the localization and magnitude of external contacts on the humanoid body. this will be done through fusion of the information from sensors embedded on the robot (including tactile sensing when available). such a haptic observer will first be developed based on classical available sensors, that are: force sensors at the ankles and hands’ wrists, accelerometers, gyro, inclinometers, desired postures (desired joints), imu and motor torques’ estimation. eventually, an extended haptic observer will also be developed to integrate tactile and force sensing if available, on parts of the humanoid robots. one of the distinguishing issues we would like to deal with is the integration of rgbd vision as part of the haptic observer. change in vision viewpoint, flow, may provide a lot of information on contact. needless to say that in some configurations, vision can also assess the localization of a non-desired or desired contact. the resulting robust whole-body haptic sensing observer will ideally return: the number of contacts, their localization on each link, the external wrench per link, distributed pressure per contact and force estimation (include tangential one) per link. the proposed observer must meet robustness and real-time performances to be used in closed-loop control for tasks such as: multi-contact stabilization, visio-haptic motion control and multi-contact planning.

candidates with background in estimation/identification, observers design in control theory, signal processing are preferred. further details can be obtained during the interview.

these researches and developments must be demonstrated in challenging domestic environments and human assistance scenarios involving aldebaran’s romeo and kawada’s hrp-4 humanoid robots.

locations: the postdoc will be conducted at the cnrs-um2 lirmm at montpellier, france. the lirmm robotics department is organised in 5 project-teams, covering research in automatics, signal and image processing, and mechanical design. specifically, the romeo 2 project is carried out by the idh (interactive digital humans) team, along with various other cutting-edge french research laboratories, and with industrial partner aldebaran. montpellier (population 265000), located in southern france, is the capital of the languedoc-roussillon region, as well as the fastest growing city in france over the past 25 years. the city is situated on hilly ground only 10 kilometers inland from the mediterranean coast. the monthly mean temperature ranges from 7.1 °c in january to 23.4 °c in july.

as captured by the mechanical impedance ? that matters if one is to build a robotic device that aims at reproducing this mechanical interaction. note also that this mechanical impedance should not be understood only at the foot/ground interaction, but also throughout the whole ?robotic leg?. the first part of the proposed phd thesis will consist in the study ? through both experiments and simulations ? of the foot/ground interaction and of the dynamics of the whole leg during contact, in light of concepts arising from robotics, such as that of mechanical impedance mentioned above. the second part will consist in the faithful reproduction of the foot/ground interaction through the design of a novel robotic device based on the knowledge gained in the first part. we believe that such a program can bring about a novel understanding of the biomechanics of running, as well as a new shoes-testing device able to reproduce the foot/ground interaction at a level of fidelity that no existing apparatus can reach. finally, the results obtained in the first part can also be used in other sport contexts which involve heavy interactions between human limbs and the environment, such as arm/racket/ball interaction in tennis or foot/ball interaction in football. *requirements* we are seeking candidates with a master or bachelor degree in engineering (mechanical, aerospace, electrical, computer science, biomedical), physiology, physics or mathematics. familiarity with concepts from biomechanics, mechanical design, control theory or robotics would be appreciated, but we are interested above all in students with sharp critical reasoning and strong background in mathematics. *about the position* this phd will be conducted at the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering (http://www.mae.ntu.edu.sg/) and the institute for sports research (http://www.isr.ntu.edu.sg/), ntu, singapore, under the supervision of assistant professor pham quang cuong (http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/cuong/) and the co-supervision of assistant professor lorenzo masia (http://www.lorenzomasia.info/). it will be funded by an ntu research scholarships (http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/graduate/scholarships/pages/researchscholarship.aspx) and should start by january 2015. interested candidates are invited to send a cv and two of their most significant publications (if applicable) to cuong at ntu.edu.sg preferably before october 1st 2014. --  quang-cuong pham www.normalesup.org/~pham"

2528,2014,postdoc openings - new techniques for  vision-assisted speech processing," istituto italiano di tecnologia (http://www.iit.it<http://www.iit.it/undefined/>) is a private foundation with the objective of promoting italy's technological development and higher education in science and technology. research at iit is carried out in highly innovative scientific fields with state-of-the-art technology. http://www.iit.it/ icub facility (http://www.iit.it/icub) and robotics, brain and cognitive sciences (http://www.iit.it/rbcs) departments are looking for 2 post-docs to be involved in the h2020 project ecomode funded by the european commission under the h2020-ict-2014-1 call (topic ict-22-2014 - multimodal and natural computer interaction). job description: robust automatic speech recognition in realistic environments for human-robot interaction, where speech is noisy and distant, is still a challenging task. vision can be used to increase speech recognition robustness by adding complementary speech-production related information. in this project visual information will be provided by an event-driven (ed) camera. ed vision sensors transmit information as soon as a change occurs in their visual field, achieving incredibly high temporal resolution, coupled with extremely low data rate and automatic segmentation of significant events. in an audio-visual speech recognition setting ed vision can not only provide new additional visual information to the speech recognizer, but also drive the temporal processing of speech by locating (in the temporal dimension) visual events related to speech production landmarks. the goal of the proposed research is the exploitation of highly dynamical information from ed vision sensors for robust speech processing. the temporal information provided by edc sensors will allow to experiment with new models of speech temporal dynamics based on events as opposed to the typical fixed-length segments (i.e. frames). in this context, we are looking for 2 highly motivated post-docs, respectively tackling vision (research challenge 1) and speech processing (research challenge 2), as oulined herebelow: research challenge 1 (vision @ icub facility - bc 69721): the post-doc will mostly work on the detection of features from event-driven cameras instrumental for improving speech recognition (e.g. lips closure, protrusion, shape, etc?). the temporal features extracted from the visual signal will be used for crossmodal event-driven speech segmentation that will drive the processing of speech. in the attempt to increase the robustness to acoustic noise and atypical speech, acoustic and visual features will be combined to recover phonetic gestures of the inner vocal tract (articulatory features). research challenge 2 (speech processing @ rbcs - bc 69724): the post-doc will mainly develop a novel speech recognition system based on visual, acoustic and (recovered) articulatory features, that will be targeted for users with mild speech impairments. the temporal information provided by edc sensors will allow to experiment with new strategies to model the temporal dynamics of normal and atypical speech. the main outcome of the project will be an audio-visual speech recognition system that robustly recognizes the most relevant commands (key phrases) delivered by users to devices in real-word usage scenarios. the resulting methods for improving speech recognition will be exploited for the implementation of a tablet with robust speech processing. given the automatic adaptation of the speech processing to the speech production rhythm, the speech recognition system will target speakers with mild speech impairments, specifically subjects with atypical speech flow and rhythm, typical of some disabilities and of the ageing population. the same approach will then be applied to the humanoid robot icub to improve its interaction with humans in cooperative tasks. skills: we are looking for highly motivated people and inquisitive minds with the curiosity to use a new and challenging technology that requires a rethinking of visual and speech processing to achieve a high payoff in terms of speed, efficiency and robustness. the candidates we are looking for should also have the following additional skills:   *   phd in computer science, robotics, engineering (or equivalent) with a background in machine learning, signal processing or related areas;   *   ability to analyze, improve and propose new algorithms;   *   good knowledge of c, c++ programming languages with proven experience. team-work, phd tutoring and general lab-related activities are expected an internationally competitive salary depending on experience will be offered. please note that these positions are pending the signature of the grant agreement with the european commission (expected start date in early 2015) how to apply: challenge 1: send applications and informal enquires to jobpost.69721 at icub.iit.it<mailto:jobpost.69721 at icub.iit.it> challenge 2: send applications and informal enquires to jobpost.69724 at rbcs.iit.it<mailto:jobpost.69724 at rbcs.iit.it> the application should include a curriculum vitae listing all publications and pdf files of the most representative publications (maximum 2) if possible, please also indicate three independent reference persons. presumed starting date: challenge 1: january 2015 (but later starts are also possible). challenge 2: june 2015 (but later starts are also possible). evaluation of the candidates starts immediately and officially closes on november 10th, 2014. references: lichtsteiner, p., posch, c., & delbruck, t.

2563,2014,phd scholarship available - real-time  action recognition for human-robot interaction - deadline october 31 2014," the faculty of technology, design and the environment at oxford brookes university is pleased to offer a three year full-time phd scholarship to a new student commencing in january 2015. the successful applicant will receive an annual bursary of ?10,000 for three years (with no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the university. the successful candidate will work within the department of computing and communication technologies - as part of both the artificial intelligence and vision group and the cognitive robotics group, under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin and dr nigel crook. topic of research: real-time action recognition for human-robot interaction action recognition is a fast-growing area of research in computer vision. the problem consists in, given a video captured by one or more cameras, detecting and recognising the category of the action performed by the person(s) who appear in the video. the problem is very challenging, for a number of reasons: labelling videos is an ambiguous task, as the same sequence can be assigned different verbal descriptions by different human observers; different motions can carry the same meaning (inherent variability); nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination variations, occlusion (as parts of the moving person can be hidden behind objects or other people) further complicate recognition. in addition, traditional action recognition benchmarks are based on a 'batch' philosophy: it is assumed that a single action is present within each video, and videos are processed as a whole, typically via algorithms which require entire days to be completed. while this can be suitable for tasks such as video browsing and retrieval over the internet (although speed is critical there), it is completely unacceptable for a number of real world applications which require a prompt, real-time interpretation of what action is taking place. examples are: human-robot and human-machine interaction (using gestures to send commands to a computer or a robot), surveillance (detecting potentially dangerous actions or events in live feeds), car driver's monitoring (monitoring the level of attention, or responding to gestural commands), gaming (interpreting the body language of a video game player), intelligent vehicles (understanding the behaviour of pedestrians and other vehicles in the vicinity of a car). consequently, a new paradigm of 'online', 'real-time' action recognition is rapidly emerging, and is likely to shape the field in coming years. the ai and vision group is already building on its multi-year experience in batch action recognition to expand towards online recognition, based on two distinct approaches: one based on the application of novel 'deep learning' neural networks to automatically segmented video regions, the other resting on continually updating an approximation of the space of 'feature' measurements extracted from images, via a set of balls of radius which depends on how difficult classification is within that region of the space. for further information about the artificial intelligence and vision group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/artificial-intelligence/ and dr fabio cuzzolin's web page: http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/fabiocuzzolin/ for information on the cognitive robotics group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/cognitive-robotics/index.html the selection criteria will focus on academic excellence, suitability of research experience and skills, subject knowledge and references. if you would like to apply you should request an application pack from ms zane kalnina, tdestudentships at brookes.ac.uk, quoting 'action recognition phd scholarship' in the subject line. fully completed applications must be sent to tdestudentships at brookes.ac.uk - by friday 31th october 2014. as part of the application you must submit a maximum 3 page outline research proposal (instructions on how to prepare a research proposal can be found on the brookes website: http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/proposals.html , together with a supporting statement of no more than 300 words summarising: your reasons for undertaking this project; preparation undertaken and previous research experience; how this bursary will make a difference to your research. please be advised that the selection process may involve an interview for a selected list of candidates, and the successful candidate would be expected to commence in the research degree programme in january 2015. dr fabio cuzzolin head of artificial intelligence group department of computing and communication technologies oxford brookes university oxford, uk http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/fabiocuzzolin/ +44 (0)1865 484526"

2570,2014,"doctoral research position at the 	university of freiburg, germany"," the university of freiburg invites candidates to apply for a fully funded three-year phd position (tv-l e13). the job offers a novel perspective to relevant problems in robotics in an inter-disciplinary approach involving engineering, artificial intelligence / machine learning, neuroscience and assistive technology. the interaction between a (semi-autonomous) robotic device (e.g., a robotic wheelchair) and a human user is often ruled by a set of strategies executed by the robot. typical robotic tasks are to accomplish a navigation task, to map the environment or to manipulate objects of the environment. the user may either control the actions of the robot or be an interaction partner for the robot. the level of control the user has over the robot's actions can be placed on the continuum between absolute low-level control (e.g., a joystick), over mid-level control (""turn right on next occasion"") up to high-level control (""take me to the kitchen""). while state-of-the-art robotic control already takes the changing environment into account before strategies are selected and executed, the internal state of the user and fluctuations thereof typically are disregarded. examples of informative mental states of users would be the level of task-induced workload, the sense of control/agency in the current situation or the perceived complexity of the current situation. in the project, relevant internal mental states of the user shall continuously be assessed. therefore, electrophysiological recordings (e.g., eeg, meg, gsr, hrv, etc.) will be exploited with methods developed in the field of brain-computer interface (bci) systems. upon successful decoding of a mental state of interest, the robotic behavior can be adapted specifically to an individual user and to the perceived situation. using the resulting co-adaptive strategy between human and robot, we expect an enhancement of usability and user acceptance during various tasks in human-robot interaction. during the project, expected tasks will comprise offline experiments with assessment of electrophysiological signals, simulated robotic control, offline and online data analysis with bci methods, online experiments with a robotic application and mental state monitoring, evaluation of adaptive strategies of the robot. the candidate is expected to actively participate in the dissemination of research results in publications, on conferences and by teaching. the target group are candidates with a degree at master level in robotics, computer science, artificial intelligence / machine learning, electrical engineering or cognitive science, with a strong relation to science, technology or innovation studies. candidates are expected to have practical experience in all of the three fields robotics, machine learning/ai, and brain-computer interfaces. we furthermore expect outstanding qualifications, the motivation to obtain a doctoral degree and the interest to work in an interdisciplinary environment. finally we require applicants to have excellent communication skills in english. applications should be send to ais-applications at informatik.uni-freiburg.de. the application documents should consist of a single pdf file and include - motivation letter (expose, respectively) - two letters of recommendation from professors or persons authorized to supervise dissertation projects - curriculum vitae - copies of the following documents:    a. higher education entrance qualification (school-leaving certificate)    b. university examination certificates (intermediate examinations)    c. university diploma    d. any documents providing evidence of academic achievements, relevant practical experience, and qualifications earned at or outside of the university further information can be obtained from wolfram burgard and michael tangermann ({burgard|tangerm}@informatik.uni-freiburg.de)."

2605,2014,phd scholarship in real-time action  recognition for human-robot interaction," the faculty of technology, design and environment at oxford brookes university is pleased to offer a three year full-time phd scholarship to a new student commencing in january 2015. the successful applicant will receive an annual bursary of ?10,000 for three years (with no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the university. the successful candidate will work within the department of computing and communication technologies - as part of both the artificial intelligence (ai) and vision group and the cognitive robotics group, under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin and dr nigel crook. topic of research: *real-time action recognition for human-robot interaction* action recognition is a fast-growing area of research in computer vision. the problem consists in, given a video captured by one or more cameras, detecting and recognising the category of the action performed by the person(s) who appear in the video. the problem is very challenging, for a number of reasons: labelling videos is an ambiguous task, as the same sequence can be assigned different verbal descriptions by different human observers; different motions can carry the same meaning (inherent variability); nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination variations, occlusion (as parts of the moving person can be hidden behind objects or other people) further complicate recognition. in addition, traditional action recognition benchmarks are based on a 'batch' philosophy: it is assumed that a single action is present within each video, and videos are processed as a whole, typically via algorithms which require entire days to be completed. while this can be suitable for tasks such as video browsing and retrieval over the internet (although speed is critical there), it is completely unacceptable for a number of real world applications which require a prompt, real-time interpretation of what action is taking place. examples are: human-robot and human-machine interaction (using gestures to send commands to a computer or a robot), surveillance (detecting potentially dangerous actions or events in live feeds), car driver's monitoring (monitoring the level of attention, or responding to gestural commands), gaming (interpreting the body language of a video game player), intelligent vehicles (understanding the behaviour of pedestrians and other vehicles in the vicinity of a car). consequently, a new paradigm of 'online', 'real-time' action recognition is rapidly emerging, and is likely to shape the field in coming years. the ai and vision group is already building on its multi-year experience in batch action recognition to expand towards online recognition, based on two distinct approaches: one based on the application of novel 'deep learning' neural networks to automatically segmented video regions, the other resting on continually updating an approximation of the space of 'feature' measurements extracted from images, via a set of balls of radius which depends on how difficult classification is within that region of the space. for further information about the artificial intelligence and vision group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/artificial-intelligence/  and dr fabio cuzzolin's web page: http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/fabiocuzzolin/ for information on the cognitive robotics group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/cognitive-robotics/index.html the selection criteria will focus on academic excellence, suitability of research experience and skills, subject knowledge and references. if you would like to apply you should request an application pack from ms zane kalnina, tdestudentships at brookes.ac.uk, quoting 'action recognition phd scholarship' in the subject line. as part of the application you must submit a maximum 3 page outline research proposal (instructions on how to prepare a research proposal can be found on the brookes website: http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/proposals.html , together with a supporting statement of no more than 300 words summarising:    - your reasons for undertaking this project;

mechanical actuator; shape-memory  alloy; active structure; mechanical design _duration and amount of grant:_18 months, 1900 euros/month _presentation of the research institute:_ the institut pascal is a structuring pole in the field of the sciences  of the engineering and the systems on the university campus of  clermont-ferrand (france). it is recognized by the blaise pascal  university (ubp), the french institute for advanced mechanics (ifma) and  the french center for scientific research (cnrs) through the joint  research unit umr cnrs/ubp/ifma 6602. the institut pascal merges the  expertises of researchers working in engineering sciences (automatic,  mechanical, electronics, process engineering) and fundamental sciences  domains (physics, biochemistry). this thematic variety constitutes a  real strength for a real multidisciplinary synergy where from can be  born systems and innovative technological objects answering economic and  societal demands. the institut pascal is organized in four thematic axes:   *     /mechanics, materials and structures/(mms): this axis develops     researches in three main topics i) materials and structures,     ii) uncertainties management in structural mechanics, iii) machines,     mechanisms and industrial systems.   *     /image, systems of perception, robotics/(ispr): this axis works in     the field of the artificial perception and vision for robotics     systems control. its objective is thus the development of     theoretical, methodological and architectural concepts for     perception and control of the artificial systems.   *     /process engineering, energetics and biosystems/(gepeb): this axis     deals with problems which belong to the bioprocess engineering     (fermentation, environmental, food processes) by means of a     multi-scale approach where the ""process"" characteristics are modelled.   *     /photonique, waves, nanomaterials/(photon): this axis collects     theorists of physics of semi-conductors and electromagnetic optics,     and experimenters in synthesis, structuralization and fine analyses     with advanced high technology. it also possesses recognized     expertises in electromagnetic compatibility. in addition, several multidisciplinary actions are developed: machines  and robots, multi-scales materials and modelling, innovations for the  bio-processes, quantitative imaging, probability approaches. _details of the research project:_ the project deals with the design, modelling, manufacturing and control  of a rotative actuator using components in shape-memory alloy (sma). the  technical objective is to develop a demonstrator of a rotative actuator  using sma wires. an advantage of using such active materials is the  ability to provide high torque compared with classical multistage  planetary gear mechanisms, while being more compact and keeping free the  inner space (gear reducer with hollow shaft). another advantage is to  obtain mechanisms with limited backlash, specifically for robotic  applications. an expected drawback is the slow actionning due to a  control based on the temperature change of the sma. so a  thermomechanical modelling (beam theory, finite element analysis) will  be used to help in the design. the analysis will be placed in the  general frame of the integration of sma actuators in machines and  mechanism. for this purpose, the database which was developed in the  european project ""thinkmotion"" will be used to estimate the relevance of  employing sma actuators in a set of machines (see the digital mechanism  and gear library*). finally, the study will open perspectives for a  better mastering of the distribution of actuators and flexibilities in  robotic architectures. three phases are proposed for the project:  1.     design, modelling, manufacturing and experimental analysis of the     demonstrator;  2.     browsing of the thinkmotion database to evaluate the relevance and     apply the developed concept to a set of machines;  3.     discussion about the distribution of actuators and flexibilities in     machines and robots. the expected results and perspectives are: publications in international  journals on innovative mechanisms and mechatronics, valorisation and  patent, numerous potential industrial applications (gear reducer with  hollow shaft...). moreover, the concept can be easily derived to other  configurations (in term of scale, rotation amplitude, torque...). _profile of the applicant:_ the applicant will have an expertise in mechanical design and will have  balanced abilities in machine design, control and modelling of  structures. he will be interested both in modelling and experimental  topics. knowledge on database will be also appreciated. the candidate  will have performed a phd thesis on a topic covering one or several  expertise domains ----------------------------------------------- jean-christophe fauroux   associate professor machines, mechanisms & robotic systems institut pascal umr 6602 ubp/cnrs/ifma ifma - french institute for advanced mechanics campus de clermont-ferrand / les cezeaux cs 20265, 63175 aubiere cedex, france tel : 00.33.4.73.28.80.50   fax : 00.33.4.73.28.81.00 mail: fauroux at ifma.fr  web : http://www.ifma.fr -----------------------------------------------"

four postdoc positions available *****           center for applied autonomous sensor systems (aass)                       ?rebro university,  sweden  ====================================================================== ---------------------------------------------------------------------- in short ---------------------------------------------------------------------- applications are invited for four postdoc positions at ?rebro university,  sweden .  all positions are funded by the national project ""semantic robots"". we seek applicants in one or more of the following areas: -- long term 3d mapping and localization -- vision based mapping and localization -- semantic perception and semantic object perception ---------------------------------------------------------------------- about the semantic robots project ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the overall aim of the project is to develop semantic robots, that is, robots which use multi-semantic models of their environment, tailored to their action and perception capabilities, in order to automatically derive and execute action plans that achieve given goals. the project will integrate research in robotics and artificial intelligence to address closely related topics, namely, semantics-based perception, 3d world modelling and planning for long-term operation in dynamic environments. semantic perception provides human-like meaning to the information a robot acquires about its environment: it derives symbolic representations from sensor data and uses them for reasoning.  models of the robot's environment should go beyond current 3d metric and topological maps, as they should be able to store and maintain more than just geometric information over long periods of time. the information extracted from the models could then be used for planning at different levels of abstraction, from task planning to fleet motion coordination. the semantic robots project involves ?rebro university as the academic partner and a number of swedish industrial partners, including volvo construction equipment, atlascopco and kollmorgen automation. the overall aim is twofold: to advance the state of the art in key areas of robotics and artificial intelligence, and to demonstrate the results obtained in industrially relevant settings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- about the positions ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the successful candidate will be employed as a postdoc with ?rebro university for an expected duration of 2 years. the main task of the postdocs will be to perform world-class research on one or more of the areas below. background/expertise in combinations of these areas is a plus. -- long term 3d mapping and localization in large scale dynamic environments the research in this area will focus on building consistent 3d maps of large environments. this involves working with cutting edge 3d scanning technology applied to autonomous industrial vehicles operating in real-world settings. more specifically, the work will address the development of new algorithms to deal with varying scales of dynamics in the environment, so as to maintain accurate models over long periods of time. in addition, research in this area will also focus on extracting and maintaining relevant semantic information (e.g., terrain classification, lane extraction, traffic flow information) from the model of the environment. the work will be carried out in close cooperation with several industrial partners, over different application scenarios.  additional opportunities for work on computer vision based methods and camera based modelling and localization are also within the scope of this area. the successful candidate will have prior experience in mapping, slam and 3d scan registration. experience with vision-based mapping and localization is a plus. -- vision based mapping and localization in natural environments the work in this area will focus on using and developing novel camera techniques for mapping and localization in large, real-world environments, ranging from large gardens to indoor warehouses. research in this area will concentrate on using machine learning and data mining techniques for developing new ways of representing additional semantic information into maps. for instance, part of the effort will be to include into maps information about different types of vegetation in outdoor environments and loading/storage areas or pedestrian crossings within warehouses. also, the work will encompass camera based modeling, detection and tracking of people. although the main focus of this area lies with using camera-based sensors, it will be possible to work also with other sensor modalities, such as lidar, laser or rgbd. the work in this area will be carried out in close cooperation with several industrial partners.  the successful candidate will have prior experience in the areas of machine learning, computer vision and mapping. -- semantic perception semantic perception is a central component to enable higher level reasoning and planning in robotic systems. an important part of semantic perception involves naming objects and measured phenomena in the environment and understanding the relations between them. this also entails providing an intuitive description of the environment in term of semantics that can be effectively shared with human users. the successful candidate will have experience in semantic perception for robotics involving both multi-modal perception, and applications in indoor and outdoor environments. the candidate is expected to hold a phd degree in the domain of machine learning, computer vision, or robotics. excellent skills in software development are required. experience with working with industry is a plus. successful candidates will work in close cooperation with a core group of senior researchers and phd students at aass who specialize in knowledge representation and reasoning, perception and mapping and planning for robots.  the results obtained within the scope of semantic robots are expected to be demonstrated outside lab test conditions in industrially-relevant scenarios and to be published in top-ranking conferences and journals. a small amount of teaching may also be part of the postdoc's duties. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- prerequisites and application process ---------------------------------------------------------------------- in addition to a clear interest, the successful applicant must have a solid theoretical background and working experience in one or more of the above research topics. a phd degree in computer science, robotics or comparable field is required, as well as a strong publication record in relevant topics. knowledge of the swedish language is not required, but proficiency in both written and spoken english is mandatory. to apply for a position, please send to <sr-recruitment at aass.oru.se>: + a motivation letter + an updated cv (including at least two references) + copies of 2/3 most relevant publications + copy of phd thesis (if available) + an updated publication list (and, preferably, a link to the applicant's google scholar profile) applications can be sent immediately, and they will be accepted until the positions are filled.  we are looking forward to receiving your application!

2660,2014,phd scholarship in real-time action  recognition for human-robot interaction," the faculty of technology, design and environment at oxford brookes university is pleased to offer a three year full-time phd scholarship to a new student commencing in april 2015. the successful applicant will receive an annual bursary of ?10,000 for three years (with no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the university. the successful candidate will work within the department of computing and communication technologies - as part of both the artificial intelligence (ai) and vision group and the cognitive robotics group, under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin and dr nigel crook. topic of research: *real-time action recognition for human-robot interaction* action recognition is a fast-growing area of research in computer vision. the problem consists in, given a video captured by one or more cameras, detecting and recognising the category of the action performed by the person(s) who appear in the video. the problem is very challenging, for a number of reasons: labelling videos is an ambiguous task, as the same sequence can be assigned different verbal descriptions by different human observers; different motions can carry the same meaning (inherent variability); nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination variations, occlusion (as parts of the moving person can be hidden behind objects or other people) further complicate recognition. in addition, traditional action recognition benchmarks are based on a 'batch' philosophy: it is assumed that a single action is present within each video, and videos are processed as a whole, typically via algorithms which require entire days to be completed. while this can be suitable for tasks such as video browsing and retrieval over the internet (although speed is critical there), it is completely unacceptable for a number of real world applications which require a prompt, real-time interpretation of what action is taking place. examples are: human-robot and human-machine interaction (using gestures to send commands to a computer or a robot), surveillance (detecting potentially dangerous actions or events in live feeds), car driver's monitoring (monitoring the level of attention, or responding to gestural commands), gaming (interpreting the body language of a video game player), intelligent vehicles (understanding the behaviour of pedestrians and other vehicles in the vicinity of a car). consequently, a new paradigm of 'online', 'real-time' action recognition is rapidly emerging, and is likely to shape the field in coming years. the ai and vision group is already building on its multi-year experience in batch action recognition to expand towards online recognition, based on two distinct approaches: one based on the application of novel 'deep learning' neural networks to automatically segmented video regions, the other resting on continually updating an approximation of the space of 'feature' measurements extracted from images, via a set of balls of radius which depends on how difficult classification is within that region of the space. for further information about the artificial intelligence and vision group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/artificial-intelligence/  and dr fabio cuzzolin's web page: http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/fabiocuzzolin/ for information on the cognitive robotics group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/cognitive-robotics/index.html the selection criteria will focus on academic excellence, suitability of research experience and skills, subject knowledge and references. if you would like to apply you should request an application pack from ms zane kalnina, tdestudentships at brookes.ac.uk, quoting 'action recognition phd scholarship' in the subject line. as part of the application you must submit a maximum 3 page outline research proposal (instructions on how to prepare a research proposal can be found on the brookes website: http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/proposals.html , together with a supporting statement of no more than 300 words summarising:    - your reasons for undertaking this project;

2661,2014,phd scholarship in real-time action  recognition for human-robot interaction," the faculty of technology, design and environment at oxford brookes university is pleased to offer a three year full-time phd scholarship to a new student commencing in april 2015. the successful applicant will receive an annual bursary of ?10,000 for three years (with no inflation increase) and the fees will be paid by the university. the successful candidate will work within the department of computing and communication technologies - as part of both the artificial intelligence (ai) and vision group and the cognitive robotics group, under the supervision of dr fabio cuzzolin and dr nigel crook. topic of research: *real-time action recognition for human-robot interaction* action recognition is a fast-growing area of research in computer vision. the problem consists in, given a video captured by one or more cameras, detecting and recognising the category of the action performed by the person(s) who appear in the video. the problem is very challenging, for a number of reasons: labelling videos is an ambiguous task, as the same sequence can be assigned different verbal descriptions by different human observers; different motions can carry the same meaning (inherent variability); nuisance factors such as viewpoint, illumination variations, occlusion (as parts of the moving person can be hidden behind objects or other people) further complicate recognition. in addition, traditional action recognition benchmarks are based on a 'batch' philosophy: it is assumed that a single action is present within each video, and videos are processed as a whole, typically via algorithms which require entire days to be completed. while this can be suitable for tasks such as video browsing and retrieval over the internet (although speed is critical there), it is completely unacceptable for a number of real world applications which require a prompt, real-time interpretation of what action is taking place. examples are: human-robot and human-machine interaction (using gestures to send commands to a computer or a robot), surveillance (detecting potentially dangerous actions or events in live feeds), car driver's monitoring (monitoring the level of attention, or responding to gestural commands), gaming (interpreting the body language of a video game player), intelligent vehicles (understanding the behaviour of pedestrians and other vehicles in the vicinity of a car). consequently, a new paradigm of 'online', 'real-time' action recognition is rapidly emerging, and is likely to shape the field in coming years. the ai and vision group is already building on its multi-year experience in batch action recognition to expand towards online recognition, based on two distinct approaches: one based on the application of novel 'deep learning' neural networks to automatically segmented video regions, the other resting on continually updating an approximation of the space of 'feature' measurements extracted from images, via a set of balls of radius which depends on how difficult classification is within that region of the space. for further information about the artificial intelligence and vision group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/artificial-intelligence/  and dr fabio cuzzolin's web page: http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/fabiocuzzolin/ for information on the cognitive robotics group, consult http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/isec/cognitive-robotics/index.html the selection criteria will focus on academic excellence, suitability of research experience and skills, subject knowledge and references. if you would like to apply you should request an application pack from ms zane kalnina, tdestudentships at brookes.ac.uk, quoting 'action recognition phd scholarship' in the subject line. as part of the application you must submit a maximum 3 page outline research proposal (instructions on how to prepare a research proposal can be found on the brookes website: http://cct.brookes.ac.uk/research/proposals.html , together with a supporting statement of no more than 300 words summarising:    - your reasons for undertaking this project;

was submitted to icra 2015. i also developed a perceptual memory system to extend previous semantic race implementation architecture as a dual memory system. the dual memory system leads to a layered and de-centralized architecture. the perceptual memory is implemented using a lightweight nosql database to meet the requirements of perceptual modules. these primarily process numeric information organized in arrays/matrices, possibly grouped in sets. moreover, to ensure timely reaction to events in the environment, perception modules run continuously at the frame rate of the used sensors. i presented the paper titled ""a perceptual memory system for grounding semantic representations in intelligent service robots"" at iros 2014. these works have been implemented and demonstrated on a real pr2 robot. these achievements and current research are certain to give both creativeness and motivation to your research group. attached please find a single document containing my curriculum vitae, list of publications, names of three references with contact information. fyi, i?m a postdoc at the university of aveiro, continuing my researches. it is planned until the end of march 2013. i?m looking forward hearing from you. yours faithfully, gi hyun lim on sat, dec 6, 2014 at 5:18 pm, gaurav s. sukhatme <gaurav at usc.edu> wrote: > > the robotic embedded systems laboratory at the university of southern > califoria (robotics.usc.edu/resl) has multiple postoc openings. > > we seek candidates with experience in one or more of the following areas: > >     planning under uncertainty, >     interactive perception, >     probabilistic state estimation, >     sensor fusion, >     object recognition, >     grasping and manipulation planning, >     multi-robot systems/control. > > a demonstrated ability to implement and test systems on real robots is > required. a background in active sensing and machine learning is > highly desirable. the successful candidates will work as part of a team > of faculty, postdocs and phd students and must have the ability to > work to deadlines. candidates must be excellent programmers and > must have (or shortly) complete a phd degree in robotics, computer > science or related discipline. > > the robotics laboratories at usc have a variety of cutting edge > experimental research testbeds. these include a willow garage pr2, an > experimental humanoid composed of a high-performance barett arm and > hand combined with a stereo head and time-of-flight range camera. a > purpose-built sarcos full body humanoid is also available for > experimental work. also available are: parrot ardrones, willow garage > turtlebots, and two custom-built quadrotors. for our aquatic robotics > research there are two robotic boats, two slocum underwater gliders > and ecomapper autonomous underwater vehicle. the successful candidates > will have shared access to all of these platforms. > > the positions are open with immediate effect, and will remain open > until filled. applicants are requested to send a single pdf file > containing a recent cv, list of papers, and the names of two referees > to prof. gaurav sukhatme (gaurav at usc.edu).  applications will be > reviewed on an ongoing basis as they are received. > > -- > gaurav s. sukhatme > professor and chairman > department of computer science, university of southern california > editor-in-chief, autonomous robots > http://robotics.usc.edu/~gaurav > -------- > > _______________________________________________ > robotics-worldwide mailing list > robotics-worldwide at usc.edu > http://duerer.usc.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/robotics-worldwide > >"
