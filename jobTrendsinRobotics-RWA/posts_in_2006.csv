http://www.eecs.iu-bremen.de/smartsystems/
***********************************************************************

as humans we can sense, act, speak, listen, decide and sometimes
understand. the 21st century will witness technologies that can do the
same. we will see cars that negotiate with each other in order to
optimize traffic flow. our t-shirts may have their own internet
addresses and tell the manufacturer if they are only rarely worn.
in addition to their well-established role as programmable
machine-tools, robots are also more and more used in domains where some
autonomy and intelligence is necessary. they work under conditions where
the robot is not constantly supervised by a human operator and where it
has to be adaptive as its developer can not fully predict which
situations it will encounter in its application environment.

we all know future descriptions of this kind; we also know that they
are no longer science fiction, although real future may still look
quite differently. but whatever route the future takes, it will be
scientists and engineers who help in shaping it. they will develop
systems (yet unthinkable) that could likewise be described as robots,
user interfaces, web agents, enhanced reality or personal assistants.

the international university bremen (iub) takes part in this rapidly
growing, boldly interdisciplinary endeavor. as part of the iub computer
science education, the graduate program in smartsystems is offered. it
integrates a rigorous training in several important disciplines of
computer science, especially robotics, networks, artificial
intelligence, databases and the mathematics of complex systems. a
student acquires in this graduate program the knowledge to work at the
forefront of technological developments.

the smartsystems program offers the following two degrees, for which a
variety of funding options and stipends is available:

master of science
=================
the m.sc.program takes two years. students on the m.sc.track who excel
in their first three semesters may enter the ph.d track.

doctor of philosophy (ph.d)
===========================
students with an excellent record of achievement in their bachelor's or
master's studies may apply to directly pursue a ph.d degree at iub. the
completion of a ph.d degree will typically take three years.


the courses in the program start each year on september 1. only a small
number of students is accepted; the admission to the program is highly
competitive. admitted students can expect financial support in several
ways. for the about twenty available places in the program, the fees are
can be waived. furthermore, there are generous additional stipends for
excellent students. the result of a gre subject test in computer science
must be included in the application. there are two rounds of admission
with respective closing dates on february 1st and may 1st.

monthly salary: 1795 euros free of tax, social security benefits included

description

the successful candidate will be required to implement and  validate 
algorithms which lead to autonomous navigation of a mobile  robot in an 
urban environment using an onboard monocular vision sensor.  initially, 
the navigation environment will be regarded as free of any other moving 
objects with only the vehicle to be controlled.

the work proposed is in the continuity of anthony remazeilles 
(http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/anthony.remazeilles-eng.html) phd 
thesis. the approach consists in using a database of images acquired 
during a preliminary learning step. the navigation involves jointly 
using the database and the current image acquired by the camera for 
determining the movement of the vehicle using qualitative visual 
servoing control laws.

a postdoctoral fellow is currently generalizing the approach, to deal 
with a non holonomic vehicle and an urban environment. the candidate 
will continue this work, in order to obtain robust and real-time 
algorithms for:
- the tracking of a set of points of interest along the image sequence 
acquired  by the camera,
- the matching of these points of interest with respect to the image 
database,
- the control law of the mobile robot using visual servoing techniques.

the implementation of the work will be integrated, tested and validated 
on the cycab vehicle

international group as presently 6 countries are represented beside  
france  (brazil, china, india, italy, mexico & singapore). the group  
has a long experience (>15 years) of research in bayesian modeling.  
it applies theese technics to robotics, artificial intelligence,  
cognitive science and developing industrial applications. the group  
has been the leader of the european project biba (bayesian inspired  
brain and artifacts) which, after 4 years of work, is just terminated.

- bacs project:
bacs is the continuation of biba. its a new european project started  
in january for 4 years. the abstract of the project is the following:
despite very extensive research efforts contemporary robots and other  
cognitive artifacts are not yet ready to
autonomously operate in complex real world environments. one of the  
major reasons for this failure in creating cognitive
situated systems is the difficulty in the handling of incomplete  
knowledge and uncertainty.
in this project we will investigate and apply bayesian models and  
approaches in order to develop artificial cognitive systems
that can carry out complex tasks in real world environments. we will  
take inspiration from the brains of mammals including
humans and apply our findings to the developments of cognitive systems.
the bayesian approach will be used to model different levels of brain  
function, from neural functions up to complex
behaviors. this will enable us to show that neural functions and  
higher-level cognitive activities can coherently be modeled
within the bayesian framework. the bayesian models will be validated  
and adapted as necessary according to
neuro-physiological data from rats and humans and through  
psychophysical experiments on human.
the bayesian approach will also be used to develop four artificial  
cognitive systems concerned with (i) autonomous
navigation, (ii) multi-modal perception and reconstruction of the  
environment, (iii) semantic facial motion tracking, and (iv)
human body motion recognition and behavior analysis.
the conducted research shall result in a consistent bayesian  
framework offering enhanced tools for probabilistic reasoning
in complex real world situations. the performance will be  
demonstrated through its applications to drive assistant systems
and 3d mapping, both very complex real world tasks.

44,2006,two postdoc positions in biologically-inspired robotics at epfl,"dear colleagues,

i would be most grateful if you could transmit the add below for postdoc 
positions in my group at epfl to any of your phd students who might be 
interested.

many thanks,

auke ijspeert

the biologically inspired robotics group (birg, http://birg.epfl.ch/) in 
the school of computer and communication sciences at epfl (lausanne, 
switzerland) anticipates (95% sure) to have *two open postdoc 
positions*: one in modular robotics (position a), and the other in 
biologically inspired amphibious robotics and control of locomotion 
(position b).

*position a: modular robotics*

this position is part of a new project in collaboration with prof. aude 
billard and prof. pierre dillenbourg on the use of modular robots for 
creating adaptive furniture. the goal of the project is to design and 
control a set of robotic building blocks that can be used to generate 
robots capable of locomotion and reconfiguration. among other things, 
the robots should serve as adaptive furniture, i.e. stools/chairs/sofas 
capable of moving and changing shape. candidates need to have a phd 
degree related to robotics. the ideal candidate for this position should 
have a background in robotics, in particular in mechanical design and in 
control. good programming skills and a strong interest in human-computer 
interaction are also needed. the responsibility of the postdoc will be 
to help designing the physical modules (in particular the connection 
mechanisms) as well as to develop reconfiguration algorithms (with 
simulated robots, as well as real modules, such as the yamor modules). 
starting date: as soon as possible (e.g june 2006).

*position b: biologically inspired amphibious robotics and control of 
locomotion*

this position is part of a project which aims at constructing and 
controling amphibious robots with multiple degrees of freedom, and at 
using inspiration from biology, in particular the concept of central 
pattern generators (cpgs), for controling their locomotion. the type of 
robots we envision are snake and salamander-like robots, see 
http://birg.epfl.ch/page53468.html for an example of our amphibious 
snake robot. the responsibility of the postdoc will be to participate to 
the design of the next generation of the robots (we aim at adding 
muscle-like actuator with useful visco-elastic properties), and to 
design adaptive locomotion controllers based on cpgs. candidates need to 
have a phd degree related to robotics. the ideal candidate for this 
position should have a background in robotics, in particular in 
mechanical design, locomotion control, and learning algorithms, and be 
interested in using robots as tools to understand biology. starting 
date: november 2006 (or as soon as possible after that).

*how to apply:
*
the application should consist of a motivation letter (explaining to 
which of the two positions you would like to apply, and why you feel 
qualified for that project), and a full cv with publication list. two 
(or more) letters of reference should be sent directly by the referees 
to prof. auke ijspeert (emails are preferred).

*deadline and starting date:*

applications are invited from today (20 april 2006), and will be 
considered continuously until the positions are filled.

45,2006,"phd student opening at the swarm-intelligent systems group, epfl","the swarm-intelligent systems group is looking for a phd student in the field of structural dynamics and control.

in order to span wide rivers economically, suspension and cable-stayed bridges with large free spans are required. such structures are suscepible to vibrations due to strong winds and, presently, these vibrations are their main limiting design factor. 
the main objective of this project is to investigate vibration control strategies using distributed, adjustable, and actively actuated winglets mounted on the bridge deck. the project is highly interdisciplinary and combines knowledge from the fields of structural and fluid dynamics, distributed structural sensing, actuation, and control. 
the work is subdivided into a theoretical part dealing with numerical simulation, and an experimental part for the verification of control strategies using a bridge model in a wind channel. applicants must hold a university degree (msc), possibly in mechanical engineering or micro-engineering. a strong knowledge in mechanics and control theory, as well as experimental skills are required. 
the project is a co-operation between the swiss federal laboratories of materials testing and research (empa) (http://www.empa.ch/) and the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne (epfl) (http://www.epfl.ch). 
it will be co-supervised by prof. a. martinoli (swarm-intelligent systems group, epfl, http://swis.epfl.ch), prof. m. parlange (laboratory of environmental fluid mechanics and hydrology, epfl, http://eflum.epfl.ch/index.en.php, and dr. daniel gsell (structural engineering research laboratory, empa, http://www.empa.ch/plugin/template/empa/626/*/---/l=2). aspects of structural dynamics and aero-elasticity will be overseen by empa researchers, while distributed control, sensing and actuation, and theoretical and experimental fluid dynamics will be overseen by epfl faculty.

51,2006,"postdoc position: laas/cnrs, france, advanced temporal models for autonomous robots","laas/cnrs is opening a postdoc position on the following subject.

advanced temporal models for autonomous robots

description:
currently, most autonomous systems, such as autonomous exploration  
rovers, integrate complex sensing and acting functionalities,  
controlled by complex deliberation mechanism (e.g. planning and  
execution control). nevertheless, this integration currently follows  
simple rules of thumb which do not rely on any clear v&v approach.   
at the functional level, a worst case empirical analysis is made and  
the developer tunes delays, priorities and cycles duration based on  
this analysis and the host machine. at the decisional level, some  
more formal methods are used (e.g. logical or constraint programming)  
and offer some temporal representation and reasoning (during  
deliberation but also execution).

moreover, the autonomy requirement of these systems keeps rising, and  
they need a more flexible approach to handle the resources used (in  
particular the cpu). thus it seems rather interesting to have a finer  
execution control model of the various functional components, based  
on their temporal interactions and relationships. such a model could  
then be used to guarantee that some temporal constraints remain  
valid, but also to better control the execution of the various  
modules while keeping the model valid. similarly, at the decisional  
level, the study of timed automata approaches could cast a new light  
on the planning and execution control problem.

the candidate will  focus his research on the following areas:

- study of existing autonomous systems
- timed automata as an unified model
- controller synthesis and  scheduling
- runtime verification and monitoring

the goal of the project is to improve the v&v aspect of current  
autonomous systems, in particular with respect to time.

this study is conducted in the framework of an anr project (amaes,  
advanced methods for autonomous embedded systems) which is jointly  
conducted by verimag, laas and liafa. part of the study will be  
implemented,  tested and demonstrated on a software  testbed.

requirements: there is no specific requirement, except having a phd   
in a related field (ai, robotics, v&v, timed systems, etc). the  
applicant should have some programming skills.

starting date: september/october 2006

duration: two year

applicants should send:
- a resume/bio
- pointers to their most important publications and/or their phd   
(only french or english documents)
- recommendation letter(s)

contact person:
felix ingrand (felix at laas.fr)

misc:
the work will be done in collaboration with verimag and liafa, and  
the candidate will visit these two laboratories during the two years.

92,2006,marie curie fellowship at inria sophia-antipolis,"phd position, marie-curie rtn fellowship:
image segmentation and modeling soft tissue deformation

this thesis will take place in the asclepios team at inria
sophia-antipolis in france within the framework of the european 
marie-curie research and training network entitled “3d anatomical human”.


description :
==============

the objective of this research and training network is to increase the
development of technologies and knowledge around virtual representations
of human body for interactive medical applications.
the network has a specific goal: developing realistic functional 3d
models for the human musculoskeletal system, the methodology being
demonstrated on the lower limb. partners of this network include the
epfl (switzerland), university of geneva (switzerland), crs4 in pula
(italy), aalborg university (danemark), ucl (uk), vrije universiteit
brussel (belgium).

the objectives of the proposed thesis are twofold. first, it consists in
segmenting anatomical structures of the lower limb (muscles, bones,
ligaments) from static and dynamic mr images. because of the variability
of those structures, the segmentation will be performed by combining
non-rigid image registration with segmentation based on deformable models.

in a second stage, the research activity will consist in developing
efficient soft tissue and muscle models that can be validated on
rheological datasets. those models should be based on continuum
mechanics and the finite element method and a procedure of estimating
mechanical parameters from rheological experiments should be developed
within the scope of the thesis.

the thesis will include training periods at some sites of the european
partners cited above.


requirements :
===============

the candidate should have a background in mathematics, mechanics or
computer science. good programming (preferably with c++) and
mathematical skills are essential. experience with numerical analysis,
modelling, medical image analysis, muscle physiology or image processing
would be an advantage. english written and spoken is necessary.

criteria on nationality, age and qualification apply. the candidate must
preferably be citizen of the european union but must not be a french
citizen or should not have spend more than 12 months in france for the
last 3 years.

we strongly encourage the application of women candidates.

salary :
========

the net income starts from 2000 € per month and may vary depending on
the family situation and the country of origin.

research position (application deadline - december 6, 2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

the intelligent robotics research group of the university of aveiro,
   portugal   , is seeking a researcher to carry out work within project
""langg - language grounding for human-robot communication"".


work description
------------------
this project is aimed at contributing to the development of
user-friendly robotic servants, that is, robots that are capable of
performing useful work for humans, in normal human environments,
and that can be commanded and instructed by human users through
natural means of interaction. the specific goal of the project is to
develop symbol and theory grounding capabilities that enable robots
to interact with their human users at the language level. this is
related to a new research topic, known as computational semiotics.
to attain this goal, the project is developing an integrated set of
perception, action, interaction and learning capabilities to enable 
a real robot to gradually learn the meaning of the natural language 
words used by humans to refer to physical patterns. these patterns 
can be physical objects in the robot's environment (e.g. persons, 
furniture, etc.) or  sensory-motor patterns, corresponding to 
actions of the robot (e.g. turn left, follow wall, grasp, etc.).

learning, in this scenario, must be seen as a lifelong incremental
process through which the robot builds and maintains a semantic
network about its task domain. the planned work will focus
on grounding the names of concrete physical objects for interaction
with a robotic arm. a component-based approach to object 
representation and learning will be investigated.


duration
---------
this research position is for an initial period of six months, but can be
renewed up to one year.

phd studies
------------
there is the possibility that this work continues as a phd project after
the first six or twelve months. such decision depends on an evaluation of
the competencies and habilitations of the selected researcher.

prerequisites
-------------
candidates should have a master degree or a portuguese
""licenciatura"" degree in computer science, electronics engineering
or related fields. preferably, candidates should have previous
experience on advanced knowledge representation, and/or signal
processing and/or machine learning techniques.

for continuing as a phd student, the researcher should have a
licenciatura degree with a final grade of at least 16/20 or a master
degree.

*********************************************************
a two-year postdoctoral position is available in the mit humans and 
automation laboratory (http://halab.mit.edu) with a flexible start 
date (but no later than summer 2007). the following is a brief description:

this research project will address requirements for operator 
cognitive support of multiple unmanned vehicle (uv) control, as well 
as develop a predictive model for operator capacity for heterogeneous 
uv control. the challenge in achieving effective management of 
multiple uvs in the future is not only to determine if automation can 
be used to improve human and system performance, but how and to what 
degree across hierarchical control loops, as well as determining the 
types of decision support that will be needed by operators given the 
high workload environment. additional aspects of this research will 
include integration of the operator capacity model in the system 
architecture design space such that government and industry designers 
can determine the impact of various architectures and capabilities.

please contact professor mary (missy) cummings for more details at 
missyc at mit.edu. the position will be filled when a suitable candidate 
is identified, so it is recommended that cvs be sent as soon as possible.

106,2006,postdoc position on mams modeling and control,"postdoc position in eu project protem

within the eu protem project, partners from academia and industry of
various eu countries (france, germany, switzerland, uk, netherlands) are
working on a next generation storage system for archiving and backup.
the aim is to realize a 1 petabyte memory in a box as small as a dvd
drive. the technology used will be probe storage, based on the ibm probe
storage program (millipede). in this technology, an array of thousands
of 100 um sized read/write heads is reading and writing data. in the
current architecture, the storage area is limited to the size of the
array, which is restricted to about 1 cm2. within the protem project,
the storage area will be expanded to several hunderd cm2, but the array
will still be small. therefore the array has to be positioned over this
big area with high accuracy and speed.

to study, design and realize this architecture, experts from very
different fields (media, mems, system architecture) will cooperate
closely in this 4 year, 10 meu project. one of the tasks of the
university of twente in the project will be to design and realize the
positioning system. we therefore have a vacancy for a postdoctoral
researcher in the field of (micro-)mechanical modelling for the duration
of 18 months. 

your task will be to evaluate various concepts of positioning systems on
their disadvantages and merits, and determine whether the overall
specifications of the device can be reached and using what concepts. for
this, a solid background in modelling and control engineering or mems is
required. we are looking for a person with strong communication skills,
capable of operating in a large, multi-national team.
